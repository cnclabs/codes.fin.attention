item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto 
executive summary the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate company 
as of december   the company had a portfolio of properties totaling approximately million square feet of gla  including wholly owned properties comprising approximately million square feet of gla and six properties owned through joint ventures comprising approximately  square feet of gla 
the portfolio  excluding three properties currently under redevelopment  was approximately leased as of that date 
the company  organized as a maryland corporation  has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially all of its assets to the operating partnership 
on december   the company owned approximately of the operating partnership  is its sole general partner  and through which it conducts all of its business 
op units are economically equivalent to the company s common stock and are convertible into the company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one for one basis 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and expense reimbursements received pursuant to long term leases 
the company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the terms of their leases 
the company focuses its investment activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers  anchored principally by regional and national grocery store chains 
the company believes  because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at supermarket anchored shopping centers  that the nature of its investments provide for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times 
the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities where it can utilize its experience in shopping center renovation  expansion  re leasing and re merchandising to achieve long term cash flow growth and favorable investment returns 
the company would also consider investment opportunities in markets beyond the pennsylvania  new jersey  connecticut and maryland areas in the event such opportunities were consistent with its focus  could be effectively controlled and managed by it  and provided that the investment has the potential for favorable investment returns and can contribute to increased shareholder value 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in response to recent guidance from the securities and exchange commission  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies  the application of which requires significant judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments and asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
these accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management s estimates are based on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the respective terms of the leases 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over cash received under applicable lease provisions is included in rents and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 
leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred 
in addition  certain operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
the company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
the company must make estimates as to the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to minimum rent  straight line rent  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the tenants payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the provision for depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method based upon the estimated useful lives of assets 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred 
additions and betterments that substantially extend the useful lives of the properties are capitalized 
the company is required to make subjective estimates as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
a shorter estimate of the useful life of an investment would have the effect of increasing depreciation expense and lowering net income  whereas a longer estimate of the useful life of the investment would have the effect of reducing depreciation expense and increasing net income 
effective january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  statement of accounting standard sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
in connection therewith  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to land  building and building improvements 
the fair value of in place leases  consisting of above and below market rents  tenant relationships  and other intangibles is allocated to intangible assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and building improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the value of in place leases is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates  over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
above and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of fair market lease rates  measured over the non cancelable terms 
this aggregate value is allocated between above and below market lease rates  tenant relationships  and other intangibles based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease 
the value of tenant relationships and other intangibles is amortized to expense  and the above and below market lease values is amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company applies sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to recognize and measure impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment event exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair market value 
real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period held for sale 
management is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because an impairment loss is recognized in the period that the assessment is made 
hedging activities from time to time  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
derivative instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
any change in the value of a derivative is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  whereas the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
if interest rate assumptions and other factors used to estimate a derivative s fair value or methodologies used to determine a derivative s effectiveness were different  amounts included in the determination of net income or accumulated other comprehensive income or loss could be affected

funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a relevant and meaningful supplemental measure of the performance of the company because it is predicated on a cash flow analysis  contrasted with net income  a measure predicated on gaap  which gives effect to non cash items such as depreciation 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  as income before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after preferred stock distributions and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are computed to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in computing ffo  the company does not add back to net income the amortization of costs incurred in connection with its financing activities or depreciation of non real estate assets  but does add back to net income those items that are defined as extraordinary under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo  the computation of ffo may vary from one company to another 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs 
the following table sets forth the company s calculations of ffo for the years ended december net loss    add deduct depreciation    limited partners interest    impairment loss  loss gain on sale of real estate   minority interests    amount distributable to minority partners    funds used in from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation had an indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the company s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its mortgages and loans payable 
the company will  when advantageous  hedge its interest rate risk using financial instruments 
the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily through i the line of credit used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand its real estate investment portfolio  and ii floating rate acquisition financing 
the company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
as of december   long term debt consisted of fixed rate secured mortgage indebtedness  variable rate secured mortgage indebtedness  and a variable rate line of credit facility 
the average interest rate on the million of fixed rate indebtedness outstanding was  with maturities at various dates through the weighted average interest rate on the company s million of variable rate debt was  with maturities at various dates through
