locationlogic aggregates  integrates and manages all information relevant to a user s location and preferences and makes that information useful for real life applications  such as find me the nearest or provide the fastest route product development and introduction we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands 
research and development expenditures represented of fiscal net revenues  of fiscal net revenues and of fiscal net revenues 
our software is primarily developed internally  with occasional use of independent software developers 
additionally  we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that held ownership rights to the technology 
the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us and canada  while translation and localization of foreign market versions  as well as some product development  is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets 
we generally translate and localize our products into french  italian  german  spanish  japanese and various chinese dialects 
portions of product development  including some software development  localization  quality assurance and technical publications  are performed in europe and asia 
the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware  operating systems and software  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences 
to keep pace with these changes  we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by our products 
we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies 
however  these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 
our software products are complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses 
in addition  we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities  while other technologies are licensed from third parties 
licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
we either own or license the software developed by third parties 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us  may not be able to provide development support to us in the future 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers  who provide products that expand the functionality of our software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
these disruptions could negatively impact these third party developers and  in turn  end users  which could harm our business 
marketing and sales we sell our products and services both through authorized distributors and resellers and directly to customers  primarily large corporations 
our customer related operations are divided into three geographic regions  the americas  europe middle east africa and asia pacific  and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations 
these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 
we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations  computer manufacturers  other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising  promotions and trade show presentations 
we employ mass marketing techniques such as web casts  seminars  telemarketing  direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals 
we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks 
computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to sales to them  if their financial condition were to deteriorate  they might not be able to make repeat purchases 
while no single customer  distributor or reseller accounted for more than of our consolidated net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years  the loss of  or a significant reduction in  business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 
we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages 
we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues 
economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note  segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
customer and reseller support we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model  augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs 
end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support  however  we do provide certain direct support for our high end discreet hardware systems 
we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training  sales training classes  the internet and direct telephone support 
we also provide optional online support through our subscription program and support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site 
there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 
developer programs one of our key strategies is to maintain an open architecture design of our software products to facilitate third party development of complementary products and industry specific software solutions 
this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses 
we offer several programs that provide marketing  sales  technical support and programming tools to developers who develop add on applications for our products 
backlog we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry 
our backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue from our subscription program  but also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped 
the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
we typically experience temporarily higher levels of this component of backlog for quarters in which we retire a release of autocad  as we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal aggregate backlog at january  and january  was approximately million and million  respectively 
although the backlog at the end of fiscal was higher than normal  we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 
competition we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 
in our design solutions segment  our primary global competitors include dassault systems and its solidworks subsidiary  parametric technology corporation  ugs plm solutions  bentley systems and esri 
in our discreet segment  our primary competitors include avid technology  alias systems a division of silicon graphics  inc and apple computer 
in addition  in each of our markets  there are numerous regional and specialized software and services companies  with which we compete 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the design software market in particular is fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  the availability of third party application software is a competitive factor within all of our markets 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation  price and training 
intellectual property and licenses we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
nonetheless  our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
from time to time  we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party s intellectual property rights  including patents 
litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic uncertainty 
disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to  among other things  costly litigation or product shipment delays  which could harm our business 
we retain ownership of software we develop 
all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrink wrap  embedded or on line licenses  or signed license agreements 
these agreements contain restrictions on duplication  disclosure and transfer 
we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid  ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries  we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
we believe  however  that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 
production and suppliers production of our design solutions segment and certain discreet segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals 
the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors 
media for our products include cd roms and diskettes  which are available from multiple sources 
user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources 
production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us 
some product assembly is also performed by independent third party contractors 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 
in addition  the discreet segment has historically relied on third party vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems 
many of discreet s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics  inc sgi 
there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi and discreet may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting its products to future sgi products and the timing of the development and release of sgi products 
employees as of january   we employed  people 
none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union  however  in certain foreign countries  our employees are represented by worker councils 
we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry  especially highly skilled engineers  is intense 
we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet of office space in locations in the united states and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries 
our executive offices and the principal offices for domestic marketing  sales and production are located in leased office space in san rafael california 
our san rafael facilities consist of approximately  square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from to we and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales  product development and technical support personnel 
during fiscal  as part of our restructuring plan  we expect to consolidate several domestic and international offices in an effort to further reduce operating expense levels 
all facilities are in good condition and are operating at capacities averaging occupancy worldwide 
we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our lease commitments 
item legal proceedings on december   spatial corp 
spatial filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and one of our consultants  d cubed ltd  seeking among other things  termination of a development and license agreement between spatial and autodesk and an injunction preventing autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement 
on october   a jury found that autodesk did not breach the agreement 
the court ordered spatial to pay autodesh approximately million for reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs of trial 
spatial filed a notice of appeal on december  appealing the decision of the jury 
the notice does not specify the basis on which spatial intends to challenge the jury s finding 
we do not know of any basis on which an appeal would be successful  and accordingly  believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk s consolidated statements of financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations  cash flows or financial position in a particular period 
we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities 
in our opinion  resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
however  it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our future results of operations  cash flows or financial position in a particular period
