item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview lexmark international  inc lexmark or the company is a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions including laser and inkjet printers  multifunction products  associated supplies and services for offices and homes 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms for business users and develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products 
the company is primarily managed along business and consumer market segments 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s reportable segments 
over the past several years  the worldwide office and home printing output opportunity has expanded as copiers and fax machines have been integrated into multifunction products 
lexmark s management believes that this integration of print copy fax scan capabilities favors companies like lexmark due to its experience in providing industry leading network printing solutions and multifunction printing products 
lexmark s management believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to projected overall market growth for to in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to sales price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  this pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to add higher profit margin optional features including network adapters  document management software  additional memory  paper handling and multifunction capabilities 
pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers who are increasingly looking for assistance to better manage and leverage their document related costs and output infrastructure 
in the inkjet product market  advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
the greater affordability of inkjet printers  as well as the growth in the all in one category  have been important factors in the growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser and inkjet printers and multifunction products continues to grow  management expects the market for supplies will grow as well  as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of those products 
while profit margins on printers and multifunction products have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure  the supplies are a higher margin  recurring business  which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriter supplies and other impact technology supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
critical accounting policies and estimates lexmark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  copyright fees  product royalty obligations  restructurings  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale 
the company also provides price protection to substantially all of its reseller customers 
the company records reductions to revenue for the estimated impact of price protection when price reductions to resellers are anticipated 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  unusual macroeconomic conditions  and historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserves the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty  estimated product failure rates  and material usage and service delivery costs 
the estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results 
to minimize warranty costs  the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
inventory reserves and adverse purchase commitments the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
the company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements  product life cycle  product pricing  and quality issues 
also  the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required 
long lived assets management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset  expected periods that an asset may be utilized  and appropriate discount rates 
pension and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and its non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the expected liability for projected benefits over the service lives of the employees in the plan and require that explicit assumptions be used to estimate future events 
examples of assumptions the company must make include selecting the following expected long term rate of return on plan assets  a discount rate that reflects the rate at which pension benefits could be settled  and the anticipated rates of future compensation increases 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the market related value of plan assets are used to calculate the expected return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
for the market related value of plan assets  the company uses a calculated value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
a five year moving average value is used for equities and high yield bonds due to the volatility of these types of investments and fair value is used for all other bonds 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
the company uses long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop its expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments at december each year 
the rate of future compensation increases is determined by the company based upon its long term plans for such increases 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s stockholders equity 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated statements of financial position a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings loss in the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial position on a net of tax basis and or as an intangible asset to the degree a company has unrecognized prior service costs 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could potentially experience significant gains 
restructuring and other charges although the company had substantially completed all restructuring activities at december  and the employees had exited the business  approximately million of severance payments were made during refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s restructuring activities

retirement related benefits the following table provides the total pre tax cost income related to lexmark s retirement plans for the years  and cost income amounts are included as an addition to reduction from  respectively  the company s cost and expense amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in millions total cost of retirement related plans comprised of defined benefit plans defined contribution plans non pension postretirement benefits the company uses long term historical actual return experience  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns to develop its assumed rate of return on pension assets used in the net periodic pension calculation 
the assumption is reviewed and set annually at the beginning of each year 
the company reduced its expected long term asset return assumption on the us plan from to at the beginning of this change  and the recognition of losses related to negative pension asset returns over the past few years  increased the cost of defined benefit plans in at the beginning of  the company further reduced its expected long term asset return assumption on its us plan from to 
this change is expected to increase pension expense by approximately million

using this process  the company reduced its discount rate assumption in the us from to at the end of and from to at the end of these changes  combined with other changes in actuarial assumptions such as the assumed rate of compensation increase  did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations for  nor are they expected to have a material effect in future effects of retirement related benefits  including the changes noted above  on the operating results of the company depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates and investment performance 
liquidity and capital resources lexmark s primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately million and million of its class a common stock during and  respectively 
the company did not repurchase shares of its class a common stock during management believes that cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating and capital needs 
however  in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient  the company has other potential sources of cash through utilization of its revolving credit facility  accounts receivable financing program or other financing sources 
cash flows from operating activities in were million  compared to million in these amounts were reduced during and by million and million  respectively  due to contributions to the us pension plan 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the pension contribution 
also contributing to the change in cash flow from operating activities were unfavorable cash flow changes in accrued liabilities  trade receivables and inventories  offset somewhat by favorable cash flow changes in accounts payable and other assets and liabilities as well as increased earnings

effective may   the company entered into a new million unsecured  revolving credit facility with a group of banks  including a million day portion and a million year portion 
upon entering into the new credit agreement  the company terminated the prior million unsecured  revolving credit facility that was due to expire on january  there were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination 
under the credit facility  the company may borrow in dollars  euros and certain other currencies 
the interest rate ranges from to above the london interbank offered rate libor for borrowings denominated in us dollars  the eurocurrency interbank offered rate euribor for borrowings denominated in euros  or other relevant international interest rate for borrowings denominated in another currency

in addition  the company is required to pay a facility fee on the million line of credit of to based upon the company s debt ratings 
the interest and facility fees are payable quarterly 
the credit agreement contains customary default provisions  leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and subsidiary debt  disposition of assets  liens and mergers and acquisitions 
the day portion of the million credit facility had a maturity date of may  during may  each lender approved the extension of the million day portion of the revolving credit facility with a new maturity date of may  the year portion of the credit facility has a maturity date of may  any amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due according to the applicable maturity dates noted above

a balance of million net of unamortized discount of million was outstanding at december  during october  the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to convert its million principal amount of senior notes from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate 
interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million were executed whereby the company will receive interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately above the six month libor 
these interest rate swaps have a maturity date of may   which is equivalent to the maturity date of the senior notes 
the company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements 
the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt 
however  a downgrade in the company s credit rating could adversely affect the company s ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
in february  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register million of debt securities 
due to the company s strong cash position  in early the company determined that it did not plan to utilize the shelf registration  and on january   withdrew its registration pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission

in october  the agreement was amended and the maximum amount of us trade receivables to be sold was decreased to million 
as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
the company bears a limited risk of bad debt losses on us trade receivables sold  since the company over collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables 
the company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold may not include amounts over days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
this facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold 
the facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which  if triggered  could adversely affect the company s liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables 
a downgrade in the company s credit rating could reduce the company s ability to sell trade receivables 
the facility expires in october  and required annual renewal of commitments in october and at december  and  the facility had no us trade receivables sold and outstanding 
at december  and  the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

the capital expenditures are expected to be funded through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenue derived from international sales  including exports from the united states  make up about half of the company s consolidated revenue  with europe accounting for approximately two thirds of international sales 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
certain of the company s latin american entities use the us dollar as their functional currency 
lexmark s operations in argentina were adversely impacted by currency devaluation in late and the first six months of this resulted in translation losses of approximately million in and approximately million in since june  the company did not experience significant translation losses related to the argentina operations 
currency translation has significantly affected international revenue and cost of revenue  but it did not have a material impact on operating income during and the operating income was materially positively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
the company acts to neutralize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
tax matters the company s effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively

as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  which have an indefinite carryforward period 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
revised december  which replaces fin fin r incorporates certain modifications to fin adopted by the fasb subsequent to the issuance of fin  including modifications to the scope of fin additionally  fin r also incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of fasb staff positions 
for all special purpose entities spes created prior to february   public entities must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  the company has evaluated the provisions of this interpretation and determined that the interpretation has no impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the company has evaluated the provisions of this statement and determined that this statement has no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits 
this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas this statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in sfas  which it replaces 
it requires additional disclosures to those in the original sfas about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the new rules also require additional disclosures in interim financial statements about the amount of net periodic benefit cost recognized and the amount of contributions paid or to be paid to a plan if significantly different from amounts previously reported 
the disclosures are required to be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
the newly required annual disclosures are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the interim disclosures are required for quarters beginning after december  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which superceded sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab updated certain interpretive guidance included in sab  including the sab guidance related to multiple element revenue arrangements  to reflect the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the basic revenue recognition principles of sab were largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  and therefore  did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp permits employers who sponsor postretirement benefit plans plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the medicare  prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
without fsp  plan sponsors would be required under sfas to account for the effects of the act in the fiscal period that includes december   the date the president signed the act into law 
for example  a calendar year plan sponsor would be required to account for the act for the first time in its year end financial statements if it uses a year end measurement date  or in its financial statements for the first quarter of calendar if it uses a september measurement date 
if deferral is elected  the deferral must remain in effect until the earlier of a the issuance of guidance by the fasb on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the act or b the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to january  the company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the act 
inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases  the company must continually manage its product costs and manufacturing processes 
factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management  and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the company s future operating results or cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below the company and its major competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and or technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their products and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant price pressure 
price reductions on inkjet or laser products or the inability to reduce costs  including warranty costs  contain expenses or increase or maintain sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that are reliable  competitive  and meet customers needs 
the markets for laser and inkjet products and associated supplies are aggressively competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the impact of competitive activities on the sales volumes or revenue of the company  or the company s inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues  could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain or grow retail shelf space or market share and on its financial results 
the introduction of products by the company or its competitors  or delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs  the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs  the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  and variations in the cost of component parts  may impact sales  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products and to increase marketing expenditures also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels of the company and its resellers 
unexpected fluctuations in reseller inventory levels could disrupt ordering patterns and may adversely affect the company s financial results 
in addition  the financial failure or loss of a key customer or reseller could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company must also be able to address production and supply constraints  particularly delays or disruptions in the supply of key components necessary for production  which may result in lost revenue or in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand
