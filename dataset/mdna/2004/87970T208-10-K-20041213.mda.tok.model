item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies 
these products provide the capability to connect standard telecommunications equipment  including standard telephones  fax machines  data modems and alarm panels with wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs frequency bands collectively cellular 
bridging the gap between wireline customer premises equipment and cellular networks  these technologies provide the company s products with the look and feel of the wireline network  providing critical communications and security needs in a variety of environments 
addressing the needs of basic voice  fax  data and security  the company s business segments are divided across two primary product lines phonecell  a line of fixed cellular terminals and fixed cellular desktop phones collectively fixed cellular terminals or fcts  and telguard  a line of wireless security products 
the growth of the fct business in any market is dependent to a considerable extent upon the growth of cellular telephone service in that market as a cost effective alternative to or substitute for landline telephone systems 
consequently  in managing the business and making decisions about where to invest resources  the company s management collects data and follows trends in the following areas of the cellular industry the cost of cellular airtime rates to consumers the cost of cellular equipment technology and components the capabilities of deployed cellular systems the number of cellular operators in a given market operating characteristics of worldwide cellular operators the number of deployed cellular networks using the same technology consumer attitudes toward cellular technology competitive and substitute products in the market place global economic conditions and economic conditions in key markets for fixed cellular telephony regulation in key markets for fixed cellular based upon trends noted from data collected in the above areas  such as improved economic conditions in latin america and local number portability in the usa  the company believes that the market for cellular fcts will experience substantial growth over the next five years 
the company generates most of its revenue by making and selling products 
it recognizes revenue when its products ship from various manufacturing locations to customers 
the company tracks its revenue in two business segments fixed cellular terminals and wireless security products 
although the company has a broad base of customers worldwide  much of its revenue is generated from large contracts  the timing of which is often unpredictable 
over the last year  the company has been pursuing a large security business market opportunity in the usa  with a large wireless carrier and a prospective partner in the security business 
the company has recently learned that the business relationship between the prospective partner and the wireless carrier may not develop as necessary for the company to participate in the market opportunity 
the company is continuing to seek this and other opportunities to expand its security business 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any fiscal quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that fiscal quarter  and potentially for future fiscal quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview wireless local loop wll  the concept of connecting standard telecommunications equipment to cellular networks  is the foundation business for the company 
it is this technique that defines our core value proposition 
in developing countries where wireline service is deficient or non existent  our products provide basic telephone service over existing cellular networks as well as new networks being constructed to expand telephone service in those countries 
the developed world  including the us and western europe  has the luxury of choice when it comes to telecommunications services 
digitization  capacity improvements  high speed data  and boundary less roaming have contributed to the success that cellular operators have enjoyed through the late s 
pervasive network coverage and lower airtime rates are driving consumers to increased cellular usage in all parts of their lives  both professional and personal 
as a result  some consumers are beginning to abandon their wired phone service altogether in favor of cellular service 
after years of steady growth  cellular carriers are experiencing a slow down in mobile subscriber growth and revenue growth 
as a result of this trend many wireless carriers are considering campaigns to displace wired phone service in order to expand their revenue base 
a market of replacing wired phone service with cellular phone service is evolving in europe s business sector  and is beginning to emerge in the residential sector in the us 
for our business  success in these developed markets is a long sought after goal 
to date  the majority of our revenues have come from the international theater 
however  the larger and more significant opportunities for revenue are in western europe and north america 
we believe the trends are in our favor 
in particular  in the us the recent regulatory requirement for wireline to cellular local number portability has removed a significant obstacle to the adoption of fixed cellular service by consumers 
wireline to cellular local number portability may prove to be an industry changing catalyst to bring fixed cellular to prominence in the developed world 
allowing a customer to retain his or her telephone number when changing from a wireline to a cellular system makes such a switch significantly more customer friendly and may encourage carriers to expand their marketing and development efforts in this direction 
the company s products are well suited to support fixed cellular applications 
although most programs are in their early stages  the company is actively involved in consulting  providing product samples  and influencing the direction of fixed cellular adoption in the usa and europe 
the company s strategy is to become the premier supplier of high quality  cost competitive fixed cellular equipment in markets throughout the world 
fundamental to its continued success is an approach  which encompasses strong investment in technology  product design  and applications development 
the company is committed to delivering solutions for today s networks  while investing in technology advancements for the constantly evolving wireless arena 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
current product lines deploy the major worldwide cellular air interface standards gsm  cdma  tdma and amps 
with gprs general packet radio service and cdma x solutions firmly in place  we expect to build on our product portfolio in fiscal year with new applications that take advantage of network evolution incorporating high speed data technologies 
for our gsm product line we plan to incorporate new edge enhanced data rates for gsm evolution technology  and for our cdma models we expect to include data transmission capability that takes advantage of cdma xev do evolution data only  we are also migrating our telguard line to gsm and cdma based digital security solutions 
fabrication of the company s products is accomplished through a combination of in house assembly and contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers make and test all printed circuit boards for the company 
the final assembly of phonecell and telguard products is performed at our facility in vernon hills  illinois  and by contract manufacturers in mexico and china 
the fixed cellular industry consists of domestic and international telecommunications equipment companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than those of the telular  and includes companies such as ericsson  lg and nokia 
many smaller companies and startups present competition to telular in markets where enforcement of our patent protection is not available or practicable 
competing with these companies in price sensitive environments is challenging  but telular does so on the basis of our higher product quality and reliability  state of the art technology and enhanced features  rapid product innovation and customer support 
although the company s contribution to the wireless security products industry has been focused on the north american market  the new gsm telguard products are expected open up the wireless security products market for the company on a global basis 
the competitive environment in the wireless security products industry is dominated by a few major equipment suppliers  who have leveraged proprietary systems to maintain their market share 
products in this market have historically been based on analog technology 
because demand for analog service in the us is predicted to decline over time  the company is developing products based on digital technology 
the company has adopted an innovator role  and has competed successfully by introducing innovative new wireless technology into the marketplace 
with respect to its interface technology  the company currently has issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
the company has successfully defended its patents in court

because the company is actively working to secure very large contracts  it is necessary for the company to maintain the capability to deliver large volumes of product with relatively short lead times 
consequently  the company has significant cash reserves  which it also uses to fund operating losses  working capital needs  and capital expenditures 
the company expects accounts receivable and inventory to return to cash in a relatively short period of time 
management regularly reviews net working capital in addition to cash to determine if it has enough cash to operate the business 
the company generally requires its foreign customers to prepay  obtain letters of credit or to qualify for export credit insurance underwritten by third party credit insurance companies prior to making international shipments 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars 
the following table sets forth our total contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies that currently affect the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations reserve for obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
the company currently considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply based on current year activity as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
the company also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
goodwill the company evaluates the fair value and recoverability of the goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements of each of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable or at least annually 
in determining fair value and recoverability  the company makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for the related business segment  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
currently  the company has significant deferred tax assets principally related to net operating losses 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and when necessary valuation allowances are established based on historical tax losses  projected future taxable income  and expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances have been provided for all deferred tax assets  as management makes assessments about the realizability of such deferred tax assets 
changes in the company s expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances  which would significantly impact the company s results of operations 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
based upon observed trends  the company believes that the market for cellular fcts will experience substantial growth over the next five years 
consistent with that expectation  the company s total revenue rose from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the company has identified significant growth opportunities in africa  brazil  china  europe  india  mexico  venezuela and the usa 
each of these markets will develop at a different pace  and the sales cycle for these regions is likely to be several months or quarters 
in china and india  the company is currently facing competition at prices that are reducing the price at which the company can sell its products to levels significantly lower than the company s historical gross margins for business in those countries  and potentially to levels at which such sales are not economical for the company 
the company is pursuing efforts to reduce its per unit costs and exploring partnership arrangements in an effort to respond to these competitive conditions 
the amount and frequency of product shipments to the company s largest customers depends on many factors  including market conditions and agreements with other suppliers 
the outcome of pending and future negotiations for orders with such customers and the timing of shipments will have a significant impact on the company s future revenues and profitability 
forward looking information please be advised that some of the information in this filing presents the company s intentions  beliefs  judgments and expectations of the future and are forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
for example  there are a number of uncertainties as to the degree and duration of the revenue momentum  which could impact the company s ability to be profitable as lower sales may likely result in lower margins 
in addition  product development expenditures  which are expected to benefit future periods  are likely to have a negative impact on near term earnings 
other risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in exhibit to this filing  include the risk that technological change will render the company s technology obsolete  that the company may be unable to protect intellectual property rights in its products  that unfavorable economic conditions could lead to lower product sales  the risk of litigation  that the company may be unable to develop new products  that the company is dependent on suppliers and contractors  that the company may be unable to maintain quality control  the risk of doing business in developing markets  that the company is dependent on research and development  that the company faces the uncertainty of additional funding  that stockholders may experience dilution of ownership interests resulting from financing activities  arising from volatility of common stock price  arising from intense industry competition including competition from its licensees and new market entrants with cellular phone docking station products and the uncertainty in the development of wireless service generally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company frequently invests available cash and cash equivalents in short term instruments such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
although the rate of interest paid on such investments may fluctuate over time  each of the company s investments is made at a fixed interest rate over the duration of the investment 
all of these investments have maturities of less than days 
the company believes its exposure to market risk fluctuates for these investments is not material as of september financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable 
to reduce its exposure to the credit risks of international customers  with the exception of customers with ownership interests by credit worthy us based companies  the company generally receives payment prior to shipment  receives irrevocable letters of credit that are confirmed by us banks  or purchases commercial credit insurance 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and charges amounts to operations when they are determined to be uncollectible 
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars
