market overview the wi fi market is composed of three segments enterprise  consumer and public hot spots 
wi fi products allow enterprises and consumers to establish high speed wireless networks within office buildings  across a corporate campus  in homes or in public areas 
these networks consist of access points or bridges that serve as the link between the wire line network and wireless users  and network interface cards for access devices 
wi fi networks are currently based on three main standards a which operates in the gigahertz band and offers speeds of up to megabits per second  b which operates in the unlicensed gigahertz band and offers up to megabits per second  and g which operates in the gigahertz band and delivers data rates of up to megabits per second 
proxim s wi fi access points and network interface cards address both the enterprise and service provider public hot spot market segments and support all three networking standards 
both the enterprise and public hot spot markets are experiencing significant growth and intensifying competition  as mobile professionals increasingly require wireless access to corporate information 
enterprise customers for proxim s wi fi products span the education  retail  finance  health care  manufacturing  transportation industries as well as government 
the broadband wireless market is comprised of broadband radio frequency rf equipment that delivers high speed  high capacity voice and data communications over a wireless medium 
the market is divided into two segments license exempt and licensed 
in each of these segments  products include point to point radios for voice and data backhaul or to connect two buildings  and point to multipoint radios which are used to connect multiple buildings in an enterprise campus or community as well as for public safety and last mile access applications 
broadband wireless has quickly established itself as a strong network access alternative and as a complement to leased lines  cable and dsl for the delivery of data  voice  video and multimedia applications to both business and residential customers 
the recent adoption of the ieee broadband wireless standards  ease of deployment  relatively low cost  and the ability to reach areas that do not have broadband infrastructure are increasing the popularity of broadband wireless 
proxim offers license exempt broadband wireless products including both point to point and point to multipoint radios in the and gigahertz bands 
these products are sold to both enterprises and service provider customers 
the proxim solution we believe that our broadband wireless systems address the growing need for bandwidth where digital phone lines or fiber optic cable are either too expensive to deploy in a timely fashion or are unavailable 
in addition  our systems extend the reach of wired service provider and enterprise networks by providing extended range coverage using our standards based wireless wide area network or wwan and wireless local area network or wlan infrastructure systems 
our products are used in a variety of applications in different markets  including voice and data backhaul 
our systems enable cellular and personal communication service providers to connect their base stations to other base stations and to existing wire line networks 
the mobile enterprise 
our systems and products enable enterprises with multiple facilities  including those located in a campus environment  to connect their facilities to expand or establish private computer and communications networks  which support both voice and data 
in addition  our wlan products extend the reach of wired enterprise networks to enable seamless mobility 

table of contents last mile access and public access 
our systems and products connect end users with a service provider s network backbone and central office  providing high speed  last mile internet access supporting voice  data and video 
public hotspots 
our wlan products provide fully featured wireless access products for the emerging public access or hot spot market 
in addition  our wwan products provide cost effective  broadband access between the hot spots and the service providers existing network infrastructure 
security and surveillance 
our wwan systems enable cost effective deployment of extensive surveillance networks  leveraging the benefits of industry standard internet protocol or ip networking products  including new generations of ip digital surveillance cameras 
our systems can also be used to rapidly and cost effectively extend the coverage of traditional  proprietary coax closed circuit television or cctv security systems 
our wwan products can be solar powered  enabling greater reach for private and public surveillance networks 
metropolitan area networks 
proxim s wwan systems enable communities  government entities and private enterprises to rapidly and cost effectively establish wide area networks across municipalities  towns or cities  connecting their dispersed facilities to support voice  data and video networks 
the key benefits of our solutions include rapid deployment 
service providers  businesses and other enterprises can rapidly and cost effectively deploy our systems to establish new  or expand existing  network infrastructures 
competing technologies such as digital phone lines and fiber optic cables generally take longer and are more costly to deploy than our broadband wireless access systems 
in addition  our license exempt systems do not require frequency coordination and regulatory approval 
as a result  service providers  businesses and other enterprises can avoid many of the time consuming processes typically required in installing licensed wireless technologies 
telecommunications grade availability of service 
we have developed error correction algorithms  fault tolerant systems and comprehensive network management software designed to enable our lynx and tsunami point to point fixed wireless systems to match or exceed fiber network availability standards 
these wireless systems are designed to provide availability  or less than five minutes of down time per year 
as a result  our systems enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to provide end users with telecommunications grade availability which is equal to or better than that offered by most alternative broadband access solutions 
high speed and long distance connections 
we have used our engineering expertise and proprietary radio frequency and digital signal processing technologies to design systems that offer an attractive combination of high speed transmission rates and long range coverage 
during the past ten years  we have introduced what we believe are some of the fastest and longest range wireless networking systems available  including our tsunami  which we believe is currently the industry s fastest microwave wireless license exempt system 
cost effective solutions 
because our technologies enable our wwan systems to transmit over longer distances and wlan access points offer greater sustained throughput than competing product designs  service providers  and enterprises often require fewer units to cover a specified area 
as a result  they are able to reduce both their initial and incremental capital expenditures for network deployments 
fully integrated end to end solution 
we offer a broad range of systems that enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to create complete broadband and local wireless networks that connect end users to network backbones  such as fiber optic networks  and to existing wired enterprise networks 
our point to point systems are primarily used within the backhaul segments of networks and also provide last mile access to large businesses 
our point to multipoint systems provide building to building connectivity for enterprise campus environments  as well as enable service providers to provide last mile access to campus  residential and small business users 
our systems use similar radio frequency technology  digital signal processing and network management software 
we believe this design commonality offers service providers  
table of contents businesses and other enterprises higher end to end performance  lower equipment costs and lower training and maintenance costs 
our broadband wireless access systems have various disadvantages and limitations 
for example  the broadband wireless access industry is technology intensive and requires us to continually develop new products or product enhancements in order for us to remain competitive 
in addition  in contrast to cellular wireless access solutions  our wwan systems require line of sight installation  which often requires the network service provider or enterprise network owner to obtain roof rights from third parties 
our systems may also experience problems due to radio signal interference  which may occur if multiple wireless systems are operating on the same radio frequencies and in the same geographic areas as our systems 
as an increasing number of unlicensed products are deployed over time  whether proxim systems or systems from our competitors  the possibility of interference between systems that operate in the same frequency increases  and in some cases there may not be sufficient frequency available in a given geographic location to allow further expansion of a customer s network 
furthermore  standardization has made the wlan market very competitive 
our products have shorter lifecycles and require constant  costly investments in innovative research and development to retain or create new competitive advantages 
strategy our objective is to be a leading global provider of broadband wireless access and networking systems 
our strategy to accomplish this objective is to capitalize on our technology expertise to rapidly introduce new products 
over the past ten years  we have developed or acquired several core technologies that form the basis of our current product lines and that we intend to use in our future product development 
our dedicated team of engineers has multi disciplinary technical capabilities  including radio frequency technology  digital signal processing and system software development 
we believe integrating these capabilities is highly complex  and we intend to continue to take advantage of our technology expertise to introduce product enhancements and new products in a rapid and cost effective manner 
utilize existing customer and partner relationships to expand into new market segments 
in  we sold our systems to approximately customers in countries 
some of our main customers and partners include at t wireless group  avaya  cingular wireless  dell computer  fujitsu  hewlett packard  motorola  telefonica  telmex  verizon wireless  china mobile  china unicom  and t mobile  usa 
we intend to build upon our relationships with current customers and partners as they continue to expand their networks and enter new market segments  such as enterprise mobility  public access  campus connectivity  security and surveillance and other private networks and last mile access 
increase our presence in international markets 
while our products are currently sold and approved for use in more than countries  we intend to increase our presence in these countries and further expand into new international markets where broadband wire line access is currently too expensive or unavailable 
in particular  as various governmental authorities make license exempt spectrum available  we believe our license exempt systems will be well positioned for rapid deployment in these international markets 
we intend to continue to expand our presence worldwide by expanding our international channels and marketing efforts  obtaining regulatory approvals for deploying our systems in new international markets  increasing our total product offerings in both existing and new international markets and establishing strategic alliances and partnerships 
aggressively market through distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators 
we have established relationships with key distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators such as anixter  comstor  digital china  hutton communication  inc  ingram micro  somera communications inc  tech data  tessco technologies incorporated and westcon inc to market and sell our systems 
to accelerate our growth  we intend to build upon our existing relationships and establish new relationships with distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators that we believe have strong relationships with potential customers for our lynx  tsunami and orinoco products 
our marketing group develops materials 
table of contents and programs such as training courses to assist our distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators in penetrating these markets 
products we classify our products into two product lines wwan and wlan product lines 
the wwan product line includes point to point lynx  tsunami products and point to multipoint tsunami products 
the wlan product line includes orinoco access point and client card products 
we design our products and systems generally to use common features  components and software 
our products operate at different transmission speeds  radio frequencies  with different ranges and support different standard interfaces

table of contents wwan products each of our point to point systems consists of two pieces of equipment at separate locations 
each piece of equipment is first connected to an end user s network by a cable and then connected by an antenna cable to an antenna  which is usually mounted on a rooftop or tower 
the two antennae are then aimed at one another to create a wireless connection between the two end user locations 
by using multiple systems  end users can connect more than two locations to form a more extensive network 
our point to multipoint system consists of a base station connected to a wire line network  which communicates with a multitude of subscriber units that connect remote local area computer networks to the main wire line network 
lynx products 
our point to point lynx products are primarily used by wireless operators to connect their base stations to other base stations and to existing wire line networks 
these connections comprise the backhaul segments of their networks 
in addition  these products are also used to establish campus and private networks and to provide fiber extension and last mile access 
our lynx products are offered in a variety of frequencies  ranging from ghz to ghz  which operate in license exempt spectrum  with a variety of data transmission speeds  ranging from kbps per second to mbps per second 
our lynx products can transmit and receive the maximum data capacity in both directions simultaneously  a feature commonly known as full duplex 
our products have a compact  fully integrated design and a built in network management system 
they can be linked together within a network and managed with simple network management protocol  or snmp  software 
snmp is an industry standard set of rules that governs network management and monitors network devices and their functions 
our lynx products also include a separate control and diagnostic channel  which remotely monitors the system s status and performance without reducing its carrying capacity 
tsunami products 
our point to point tsunami products primarily enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to expand or establish private networks by bridging internet traffic among multiple facilities 
in addition  these products are also used to provide last mile access 
tsunami products are currently offered in frequencies ranging from ghz to ghz  with a variety of data transmission speeds ranging from mbps per second to mbps per second 
like our lynx products  our tsunami products offer features including full duplex transmission  fully integrated design and a separate control and diagnostic channel 
in addition  our higher capacity tsunami systems include one or more additional t or e connections without reducing the carrying capacity of the system 
the additional t or e connection is a standard telecommunications interface that is not based on internet protocol and is typically used for voice and or video 
point to multipoint products 
our point to multipoint systems enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to cost effectively connect end users to a central hub 
businesses and other enterprises may also use these systems to cost effectively connect multiple facilities within their private networks 
our point to multipoint systems are deployed in a hub and spoke configuration consisting of a single central hub and equipment located at each end user s premises 
the central hub wirelessly connects to the remote customer premises equipment  prioritizing transmissions and allocating slots of time to each end user based on a system called time division duplexing 
we believe our time division duplexing technology provides a more efficient use of capacity compared to most alternative technologies to accommodate the peaks and lows of traffic between each end user and the central hub 
central hubs operate in a variety of frequencies  in various geographic configurations and are capable of supporting hundreds of units of customer premises equipment 
the hub unit can also connect to the central office of a service provider using our point to point technology 
the customer premises equipment transmits and receives data between the end user and the central hub at various transmission speeds and frequencies 
wlan products orinoco access point 
our family of orinoco access points offer solutions for enterprises and public access enabling corporate user access and creation of hot spots in small  medium and large venues 
each of our orinoco access points is a full featured wireless bridge that extends the range of wired ethernet networks and enables migration from b  ghz  wlans to g  ghz  wlans or 
table of contents to a  ghz  wlans 
with single and dual radio architecture  the orinoco access points provide configuration flexibility and increased network capacity 
our orinoco access points also provide high level security including ieee x  which is a part of the windows xp operating system 
our wireless distribution system feature enables wireless inter connectivity of multiple orinoco access points  providing for a variety of wireless infrastructure configurations without the use of additional t cabling 
web enabled and snmp network management allow for simple configuration and remote management of each orinoco network 
through a strategic alliance with wavelink  we also offer a graphic user interface for remote management of larger  more complex networks  we believe that the high performance wi fi compliant orinoco family of access points are ideal wlan solutions for the enterprise 
orinoco client cards 
our orinoco client cards deliver mobile convenience  easy installation and a configuration utility that allows users to connect quickly and simply 
orinoco client cards for notebooks and desktops work together with all orinoco infrastructure products including access points  residential gateways  and access servers

packaged client adapters include the following form factors usb  isa and pci adapter for desktop computers  orinoco a  b  g combocard and b orinoco pc card for notebook computers and ethernet and serial external adapters 
orinoco broadband gateway 
our orinoco broadband gateway provides wi fi b wlan for the small business or residence 
discontinuation of this product has been announced to our channel partners as this market segment is no longer in line with our strategic focus 
technology over the past ten years  we have developed a number of core technologies that form the basis of our current product offerings and which we expect to use in our future product development 
our primary areas of technology expertise are radio frequency technology  digital signal processing and system software development 
while there are unique methods employed for developing our wwan and wlan product lines today  there is an increasing amount of overlap  particularly within the system software area 
we anticipate that over time and especially with the emergence of technology such as wimax that the degree of commonality will be significantly higher 
radio frequency technology 
microwave technology is the technology used to wirelessly transmit data  voice and video 
microwave technology uses radio frequencies ranging from ghz up to ghz 
we have the ability to internally develop microwave circuit board designs as well as qualify  direct and utilize external partners 
we believe having both internal and external design capabilities provides us with higher performance  lower production costs  shorter development cycles and the ability to customize our products so that they can more easily be integrated with our existing products and with the networks of our various customers and end users 
digital signal processing technology 
our products use either proprietary or third party  standards based digital signal processing technologies and designs that we either develop specifically for use in wireless systems or adapt to those same wireless systems 
specifically  all of our orinoco wlan products utilize third party chipsets that embody the requirements set forth by a  b  g and ensure that we can achieve wi fi certification 
currently  all of our tsunami and lynx  wwan products are implemented using our internally developed  proprietary asics 
we believe this combination of technologies has enabled us to introduce a number of high speed wireless products that we may not have been able to produce otherwise 
we believe we can develop flexible  innovative products more quickly than those competitors who do not have similar capabilities 
we are currently using our technological expertise in digital signal processing to develop next generation  high speed wireless systems designed to transcend the indoor and outdoor user domains 
system software 
our products are networking products and follow closely the principles set forth in the osi layer model which is a guideline for the logical partition of functionality within and between 
table of contents distributed computing machines 
careful consideration is given to when to implement software to run on a host processor and when to implement it in firmware running in the dsp asic described above 
there are industry practices  trade secrets  and specific industrial knowledge that influence our thinking and guide us to create the software architectures that meet the specific system requirements 
we strive to leverage common software elements such the vxworks operating system and other third party components 
we have developed certain unique software capabilities that we believe deliver specific market advantage such as our wireless outdoor routing protocol worp 
nearly all of our systems use snmp based software that enables remote monitoring and control and facilitate the integration and compatibility of our products with larger communications networks 
research and development our research and development efforts are focused on improving the functionality and performance of our existing products as well as developing new products to meet the changing needs of our diverse base of customers and end users 
we are currently pursuing the following research and development initiatives advancing our point to multipoint systems  adapting our products to additional frequencies and interfaces  developing higher speed products  increasing the performance of our digital signal processing technology  and designing our products for lower cost  outsourced manufacturing  assembly and testing 
we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products  enhancing existing products  expanding and improving our core wireless technologies and strengthening our technological expertise 
over the past ten years  we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
we invested approximately million  million and million in research and development activities in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing we sell our products worldwide to service providers and enterprise customers  directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  system integrators  value added resellers  and original equipment manufacturers 
we focus our marketing efforts on supporting our direct sales force  distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators 
we also seek to stimulate market demand by increasing brand awareness and educating potential customers about the advantages of using our products 
additionally  we sell directly to oem customers 
we sell both design in products for integration into their wireless computing platforms and branded products as private label models 
any significant decline in direct sales to end users or in sales to our distributors or value added resellers  or the loss of any of our distributors  value added resellers or oem customers  could materially adversely affect our revenue 
in the united states and canada  our sales force focuses on key strategic accounts such as service providers  businesses and other enterprises and also develops relationships with end users that purchase through distributors and value added resellers 
outside the united states and canada  sales are generally made through distributors or value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
our sales force  however  develops direct relationships with end users either independently  in which case the sales representative then brings in the distributor or value added reseller to complete the sale  or together with the distributors or value added resellers 
we have established relationships with large national and international distributors  local and specialized distributors and value added resellers 
the distributors sell our products  and the value added resellers not only sell our products  but also assist their customers in network design  installation and testing 
in some cases  both distributors and value added resellers also assist their customers with financing  maintenance and the purchase of ancillary equipment necessary for installation of a wireless network 

table of contents historically  we have not operated with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of our revenues in any quarter was derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  a significant component of our revenue expectations will be based almost entirely on internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates 
we have a globally diversified base of customers and end users consisting of service providers  businesses and other enterprises 
in  we sold our products to approximately customers in countries 
the following table summarizes each customer  which accounted for more than of the company s total revenue in each of the last three years year ended december  tech data corporation comstor somera communications  inc tessco technologies customer accounted for less than of total revenue in the respective fiscal year 
during the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total sales 
revenue from shipments by western multiplex to customers outside of the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors  represented of total revenue during the year ended december  revenue from shipments by proxim  inc to customers outside the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors and oem customers  represented of total revenue during the year ended december  agere s sales of its orinoco products included sales to a number of international customers  and we expect that we will continue to sell these products to a significant percentage of international customers 
we expect that our revenue from shipments to international customers to vary but remain significant as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
currently  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not directly exposed to currency exchange risks other than the risk that exchange rate fluctuations may make our products more expensive for customers outside the united states and  as a result  could decrease international sales 
in addition  we face risks inherent in conducting global business 
these risks  which are more fully described herein  include extended collection time for receivables  reduced ability to enforce obligations and reduced protection for our intellectual property 
customer service we are committed to providing our customers with high levels of service and support 
we provide training  technical assistance and customer support on the installation  management  use and testing of our products 
we also provide warranties for our products consistent with industry practices in the wlan and wwan markets  and we offer both in warranty and out of warranty repair services 
our repair center is staffed with technicians who work directly with our quality assurance team to identify potential problems and repair equipment 
in addition  we offer premium hardware and software support under our servpak program 
manufacturing our manufacturing strategy is to supply high quality products in a timely fashion to our customers  while making efforts to maximize our gross margins 
we perform manufacturing tasks internally that cannot be effectively outsourced  but we outsource activities which can be performed more effectively at specialized manufacturing partners 
our iso certified manufacturing operation  based in our sunnyvale  california facility  consists primarily of pilot production  product assembly and product testing for our most complex products 
for our higher volume products  we outsource manufacturing and procurement of 
table of contents component parts to contract manufacturers with the expertise and ability to achieve the cost reductions and quick response times to orders  while maintaining our quality standards 
this allows us to focus our internal resources on developing new products 
for our current lynx and tsunami products as well as for the new generation of those products  we use contract manufacturing partners in the bay area in conjunction with our sunnyvale facility 
we manufacture our orinoco and tsunami multipoint products through contract manufacturers in asia 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in our products 
any disruptions in the supply of these components or assemblies could delay or decrease our revenues 
in addition  even for components with multiple sources  there have been  and may continue to be  shortages due to capacity constraints caused by high demand 
we do not have any long term arrangements with our suppliers 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quantity or quality requirements  or stops selling components to us or to our contract manufacturers at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product reputation problems 
because the key components and assemblies of our products are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times  we may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers to produce our components and assemblies on a timely basis 
we have experienced shortages of some of these components in the past  which delayed related revenue  and we may experience shortages in the future 
in addition  because the majority of our products have a short sales cycle of between and days  we may have difficulty in making accurate and reliable forecasts of product needs 
as a result  we could experience shortages in supply  which could delay or decrease revenue because our customers may cancel their orders or choose a competitor for their future needs 
we have limited manufacturing capability and limited experience in large scale or foreign manufacturing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
in addition  in order to compete successfully  we will need to achieve significant product cost reductions 
although we intend to achieve cost reductions through engineering improvements  production economies  and manufacturing at lower cost locations including outside the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment  and there can be no assurance that any such new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in developing industries  particularly companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include an unpredictable customer demand environment  uncertain acceptance of new products and services  competition  and challenges in managing growth 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in addressing these risks 
if we fail to do so  our revenue and operating results could be materially harmed 
competition the markets for broadband wireless access systems and wireless local area networking are extremely competitive and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors affecting wireless local area networking and broadband wireless access markets include the following data throughput  effective rf coverage area  interference immunity  network security  network scalability  price  integration with voice technology  wireless networking protocol sophistication  ability to support industry standards  roaming capability  power consumption  product miniaturization  product reliability  ease of use  product costs  product features and applications  product time to market  product certifications  changes to government regulations with respect to each country served and related to 
table of contents the use of radio spectrum  brand recognition  oem partnerships  marketing alliances  manufacturing capabilities and experience  effective distribution channels  and company reputation 
in the markets for wireless local area networks or wlan  we could be at a disadvantage to competitors  particularly symbol  cisco systems including linksys  which was acquired by cisco systems  netgear  and d link  which have broader distribution channels  greater brand recognition  more extensive patent portfolios  and more diversified product lines 
in the broadband wireless access market  we have several competitors including without limitation  alvarion  ceragon networks  stratex networks  and harris corporation 
we also face competition from a variety of companies that offer different technologies in the emerging enterprise wireless networking and service provider broadband wireless access markets 
as the barriers to entry in the ieee wireless local area networking market continue to erode  numerous companies have announced their intention to develop or have introduced competing products in the enterprise wireless networking markets  including several asia based companies offering low price ieee a  b  g products 
in addition  wireless functionality is increasingly embedded into client devices such as personal computers  or pcs  and personal digital assistants  which further erodes the market for add on wireless network adapters 
we may face future competition from companies that offer products  which replace network adapters or offer alternative communications solutions  such as large computer companies or pc peripheral companies 
furthermore  we could face competition from certain of our oem customers  which have  or could acquire  wireless engineering and product development capabilities  or might elect to offer competing technologies 
while we will continue to innovate in the wireless local area and wireless wide area networking markets  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors or that competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  non disclosure agreements  invention assignment agreements and other security measures in order to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have been issued twenty us patents that are important to our current business  and we have several patent applications pending in the us that relate to our core technologies and product designs 
we can offer no assurance that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we can offer no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted would adequately protect us 
since us patent applications are maintained in secrecy until patents are issued  and since publication of inventions in the technical or patent literature tends to lag behind such inventions by several months  we cannot be certain that we first created the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions or that we are not infringing on the patents of others 
in addition  we have filed  or reserved our rights to file  a number of patent applications internationally 
we can offer no assurance that any international patent application will issue or that the laws of foreign jurisdictions will protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to our registered intellectual property  we also use proprietary technology in our business 
this technology includes internally developed proprietary error correction algorithms  fault tolerant systems and comprehensive network management software 
a significant portion of this technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise that has been developed over time by our employees 
in order to maintain the confidential nature of this technology  we have chosen to protect it by generally limiting access to it  treating portions of it as trade secrets and obtaining confidentiality or non disclosure agreements from persons who are given access to it 
all of our employees have signed our standard confidentiality agreement  which prohibits them from disclosing our confidential information  technology developments and business practices  as well as any confidential information entrusted to us by other parties 
similarly  all of the consultants who have been given access to our confidential information or proprietary technology have signed an agreement prohibiting them from disclosing that information and technology to others 

table of contents although we intend to protect our proprietary rights vigorously  there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or may take to protect our proprietary rights will be successful 
we expect that litigation may continue to be necessary to enforce our patents  trademarks or other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  to establish the validity of any technology licenses offered to patent infringers  to prevent the importation of infringing products into the united states  or to defend against claims of infringement 
litigation has resulted in and could further continue to result  in substantial costs and diversion of resources and  if determined adversely to us  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
moreover  we can offer no assurance that in the future these rights will be upheld 
there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or may take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that others will not independently develop similar products  design around our proprietary or patented technology or duplicate our products 
for more information regarding our pending patent litigation  see item  legal proceedings set forth herein 
the results of any litigation matter are inherently uncertain 
in the event of any adverse decision in the described legal actions or any other related litigation with third parties that could arise in the future with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights relevant to our products  we could be required to pay damages and other expenses  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
we cannot make any assurance that these matters will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
government regulation our products are subject to extensive telecommunications based regulation by the united states and foreign laws and international treaties 
we must conform our products to a variety of regulatory requirements and protocols established to  among other things  avoid interference among users of radio frequencies and to permit interconnection of equipment 
each country has different regulations and a different regulatory process 
in order for our products to be used in some jurisdictions  regulatory approval and  in some cases  specific country compliance testing and re testing may be required 
the delays inherent in this regulatory approval process may force us to reschedule  postpone or cancel the installation of our products by our customers  which may result in significant reductions in our sales 
in the united states  we are subject to various federal communications commission  or fcc  rules and regulations 
current fcc regulations permit license free operation in certain fcc certified bands in the radio spectrum 
our wireless products are certified for unlicensed operation in the mhz  ghz  ghz and ghz frequency bands  and we expect they will soon be certified for operation in the recently allocated ghz frequency band 
operation in these frequency bands is governed by rules set forth in part of the fcc regulations 
the part rules are designed to minimize the probability of interference to other users of the spectrum and  thus  accord part systems unlicensed status in the frequency band 
in the event that there is harmful interference caused by a part user  the fcc can require the part user to curtail transmissions that create interference 
in this regard  if users of our products experience excessive interference from primary users  market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the fcc  however  has established certain standards that create an irrefutable presumption of noninterference for part users and we believe that our products comply with such requirements 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  changes in the use of allocated frequency spectrum  or modification to the standards establishing an irrefutable presumption of non interference for unlicensed part users  would not significantly affect our operations by rendering current products obsolete  restricting the applications and markets served by our products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
our products are also subject to regulatory requirements in international markets and  therefore  we must monitor the development of radio frequency regulations in certain countries that represent potential markets for our products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with regulations in any 
table of contents particular country  we will design our products to minimize the design modifications required to meet various ghz and ghz international spread spectrum regulations  as well as in other frequency bands we may design our products to use 
in addition  we will seek to obtain international certifications for our product line in countries where there are substantial markets for wireless networking systems 
changes in  or the failure by us to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  with respect to those countries that do not follow fcc regulations  we may need to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations 
regulatory changes by the fcc or by regulatory agencies outside the united states  including changes in the availability of spectrum  could significantly affect our operations by restricting our development efforts  rendering current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
several changes by the fcc were approved within the last eight years including changes in the availability of spectrum  as well as the granting of an interim waiver 
these approved changes could create opportunities for other wireless networking products and services 
there can be no assurance that new regulations will not be promulgated  that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
it is possible that the united states and other jurisdictions will adopt new laws and regulations affecting the pricing  characteristics and quality of broadband wireless systems and products 
increased government regulations could decrease the growth of the broadband wireless industry  hinder our ability to conduct business internationally  reduce our revenues  increase the costs and pricing of our products  increase our operating expenses  and expose us to significant liabilities 
any of these events or circumstances could seriously harm our business and results of operations

table of contents to the funds affiliated with warburg pincus and broadview capital under the secured promissory notes issued in july and amended in october and the senior secured promissory notes issued in december the amended a r financing agreement requires the consent of the lender in order to incur debt  grant liens and sell assets

following the jury verdict  a special committee of members of our board of directors not affiliated with the investors considered the potential impact of the jury verdict on our financial statements and results of operations for the third quarter of the special committee considered the possibility that the establishment of a reserve for estimated royalties and interest based on the jury verdict and the ongoing litigation with symbol technologies would  in the absence of a settlement  result in a material adverse change and or an event of default under the original notes  causing all outstanding indebtedness in favor of the investors to become immediately due and payable 
in addition  the special committee considered the possibility that the jury verdict prevent us from accessing an additional million investment from the investors

in march  the court dismissed the contract claims against agere but at the same time granted top global s motion for leave to amend its complaint to allege a fraud claim against agere 
discovery continues and a trial setting conference is scheduled for may  on february   we received a copy of a complaint filed on february  in tokyo district court by active technology corporation  a japanese based distributor of our products 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that we sold to active certain defective products  which active in turn subsequently sold to its customers 
active seeks damages of million japanese yen  which includes the purchase price of the allegedly defective products and replacement costs allegedly incurred by active

we are party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of suppliers and vendors 
these disputes relate primarily to excess materials and order cancellation claims that resulted from the declines in demand for our products during and and the commensurate reductions in manufacturing volumes 
we have recorded reserves related to these disputes to the extent that management believes appropriate and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these claims 
the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain

we cannot make any assurance that these matters will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
in particular  if the proceedings before the court in our litigation with symbol are not decided in our favor  we would likely be required to make significant payments to symbol  including payments for royalties related to past sales of products found to infringe and additional royalties in connection with future sales of these products  or we would be required to post a bond in order to appeal the court s decision 
any adverse ruling or judgment in this litigation that requires us to render payment or post a bond equal to or greater than million  and any other ruling or judgment in this or any other litigation that is material and adverse to us  triggers an event of default under the notes issued to warburg pincus and affiliates of broadview capital 
upon such occurrence  the investors would have the ability to require us to repay the notes 
in addition  entry of any judgment  restraining order  injunction or any material adverse development in the litigation with symbol would result in an event of default under the secured credit facility with silicon valley bank 
upon such occurrence  silicon valley bank would have the ability to require us to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit facility and to prohibit us from borrowing any additional amounts 
if we were required to make payments to symbol  post a bond to the court  and or repay the notes and amounts  if any  owed to silicon valley bank  either due to an event of default or otherwise  we would be required to obtain immediate alternative sources of financing 
if we were not able to obtain an alternative source of financing  we would most likely have insufficient cash to pay these obligations  be unable to meet our ongoing operating obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business  and may have to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws

proxim corporation was formed in march as a result of the merger between western multiplex corporation and proxim  inc in august  we acquired agere systems wireless local area networking wlan equipment business  including its market leading orinoco b product line 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the results of operations for the periods presented include the results of the merged or acquired businesses beginning on the respective dates of completion of the business combinations 
prior to march  we operated as western multiplex corporation  a designer and manufacturer of broadband wireless systems 

table of contents proxim corporation is a leader in wireless networking equipment for wi fi and broadband wireless networks 
we provide wireless solutions for the mobile enterprise  security and surveillance  last mile access  voice and data backhaul  public hot spots  and metropolitan area networks 
we serve these markets by selling our systems to service providers  businesses and other enterprises  directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  value added resellers  products integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our lynx and tsunami systems for our wwan product line  and the sale of standards based products  acquired in the proxim  inc acquisition  and products acquired from agere  for our wlan product line 
we introduced the tsunami products during the fourth quarter of while our tsunami products and lynx products have similar pricing for comparable models  our lynx product line contributes the largest part of our revenue 
we began selling our tsunami point to multipoint systems in we also generate a small percentage of our revenue from the sale of services and parts and rentals of our systems 
we sell worldwide to service providers  businesses and other enterprises directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  value added resellers and system integrators 
shipments to certain distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return  protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by our distributors and co op marketing programs 
restructuring we started with million in cash and cash equivalents  down million from million at the beginning of the effects of an ongoing operating loss and restructuring charges  left us with cash and cash equivalents of million at the end of the second quarter of to address the lack of sufficient working capital and the ongoing negative cash flow  we focused on raising additional financing and restructuring the operations of the business 
financing 
in a two part transaction  we raised an additional million in as discussed in part i  item  business in greater detail  warburg pincus private equity viii  lp and broadview capital partners lp and affiliates signed a securities purchase agreement in july   later amended in october   pursuant to which we received million in exchange for issuing demand notes bearing interest at per annum and exchangeable for shares of series b preferred stock 
in december  after stockholder approval of our transactions with the investors  as described in part  item  submission of matters to a vote of security holders  we exercised our right to draw an additional million from the investors in exchange for additional notes  senior to but otherwise having the same terms as the october notes 
operational changes 
in may  we hired a new president and chief executive officer  frank plastina 
shortly thereafter  we commenced a consolidation of our wireless wan and wireless lan divisions and their underlying separate sales  engineering and operating departments with the goal of improving efficiency  reducing headcount and lowering operating costs 
product developments proxim  inc and western multiplex merged with the vision of forming a company that has the ability to provide wireless connectivity in any configuration regardless of whether the radios were providing access indoors or outdoors  and regardless of whether or not they were performing a bridging or routing function 
this seamless wwan wlan capability is the backbone of our convergence strategy today 
we subsequently acquired the orinoco business from agere systems to enhance our position in the enterprise wireless lan space 
the resulting company had eight research and development centers and a multitude of product platforms and product variants 
in order to realize the benefits of this strategy of converging wlan wwan  in early  we focused on streamlining the product development and manufacturing operations 
in this respect  we consolidated all product development activity in two locations  sunnyvale  california and bangalore  india 
manufacturing operations were consolidated in sunnyvale  california and the number of contract manufacturers was substantially reduced 

table of contents during the remainder of  we completed the rationalization of the combined portfolio of western multiplex  orinoco and proxim 
central to that effort was the elimination of redundancy between the original orinoco and proxim product lines 
former proxim products such as harmony  skyline  and symphony were discontinued  although much of the underlying technology and networking principles were carried forward and embodied in our new advanced products including the orinoco wireless switching system 
in parallel  we developed new platforms on which to standardize the product development efforts 
these platforms will allow us to release enhanced versions of our currently existing product portfolio in and are providing improved product costs  industry leading functionality  and  in some cases  pioneering new market categories that we believe will enable proxim to expand our market presence 
our new platforms include the gx broadband point to point platform on which we will re launch all of our lynx and tsunami wireless bridge products  and a wifi platform on which our new orinoco enterprise class access point products and tsunami mp 
point to multipoint products for wireless internet service providers and campus networking are based upon 
we have also recently announced the development of the orinoco wireless switching solution 
this product is the cornerstone of a strategic relationship with motorola and avaya where the three parties are working to create a converged wifi cellular solution 
we intend to continue to further the wwan wlan converged strategy 
augmenting this basic wireless connectivity strategy we intend to continue to support standards based  interoperable solutions wherever possible and practical 
today  that means producing wifi compliant solutions for the indoors and in the future that will mean developing wimax compliant solutions for the outdoors 
we intend to closely watch developments related to available spectrum  unlicensed or licensed  and develop products in those bands that are demanded by our customers and provide us with the most promising returns on r d investment 
financial performance our total revenue  net for was million  a increase over our total revenue  net for  reflecting the first full year of contribution from our acquisition of the orinoco product line of agere systems in the third quarter of and of proxim in the first quarter of  a one time patent license fee of million resulting from our patent litigation settlement with intersil  partially offset by a decrease in the wwan product revenue 
in our two key geographies  north america and international  revenue comprised of and  respectively  of total revenue in and and  respectively  of total revenue  net in year over year  north american revenue decreased by  and international revenue increased by net loss attributable to common stockholders in was million versus million in net loss in was largely driven by restructuring charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  estimated potential royalties and interest charges of million accrued for related to the litigation with symbol technologies  restructuring charges of million  and associated costs of raising million and issuing convertible notes to our investors 
the loss incurred in was largely driven by an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million recorded due to a significant decline in forecasted revenue  restructuring charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million  restructuring charges of million  and purchased in process research and development of million related to products acquired in acquisitions 
gross profit decreased by million or from million in and million or in gross profit or gross margin for the year ended december  included royalty charges of million or of total revenue and restructuring provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million or of total revenue 
gross profit or gross margin for the year ended december  included restructuring provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million or of total revenue 

table of contents excluding royalty charges and the restructuring provision for excess and obsolete inventory  gross profit or gross margin declined by million or from million or in to million or in  primarily attributable to the increase in wlan product sales in  as wlan products generally carry lower gross margins than wwan product sales 
days sales outstanding  or dsos  year over year improved from days in to days in  contributing in large part to the decrease in accounts receivable from million at december  to million at december  management s focus on improved collections primarily in the second half of resulted in dso improvements 
quarterly dsos in were   and days in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
inventory decreased from million in to million in days of inventory improved from days to days from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  primarily attributable to our efforts to improve supply chain management and forecasting 
combined research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses operating costs improved from million in to million  primarily attributable to our restructuring activities and cost reduction efforts 
these operational activities have shown tangible financial results throughout the year as operating costs have declined each quarter 
operating costs were million  million  million  and million for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated future sales return and warranty costs is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
proxim has no obligation to provide any modification or customization upgrades  enhancements or other post sale customer support 
proxim grants certain distributors limited rights of return and price protection on unsold products 
product revenue on shipments to distributors  which have rights of return and price protection  is deferred until shipment to end customers by the distributors 
effective june   we began to recognize sales of our wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment by the distributors to the end user customer 
prior to june   we recognized revenue for sales of wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment to the distributor and provided reserves for the estimated amount of product returns at the time the revenue was recognized 
the combination of the changes resulting from the then proposed acquisition of the agere systems wlan 
table of contents business and the adoption of one uniform method was consistent with our plans to sell bundled and integrated wlan and wwan products 
this change in accounting methodology was treated as a change in estimate  and was made on a prospective basis starting in the third quarter of deferred gross profit on these distributors sales at december  was million 
in addition to the deferral of product revenue identified below  we reported accounts receivable net of deferred revenue and carried the value of the related products as consigned inventory 
as of december   accounts receivable was reduced by million to million and we recorded inventory consigned to customers of million which increased total inventory to million 
revenue from services  such as pre installation diagnostic testing and product repair services  is recognized over the period for which the services are performed  which is typically less than one month 
revenue from enhanced service contracts is recognized over the contract period  which ranges from one to three years 
allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we record estimated reductions to revenue for sales return  customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection and promotions 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty provision we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs  including adverse purchase order commitments to our vendors  may be required 
valuation of investment we hold an investment in a company having operations and technology within our strategic focus 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we 
table of contents would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring costs and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise  exiting businesses 
any decision to limit investment in or to dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges  such as inventory and technology related write offs and workforce reduction costs  charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities  or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products 
estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions 
estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
patent litigation and infringement costs we have been involved in litigation in the normal course of business 
the results of any litigation matter are inherently uncertain 
in the event of any adverse decision in litigation with third parties that was pending as of december  and those that could arise in the future with respect to patents  other intellectual property rights relevant to our products and defective products  we could be required to pay damages and other expenses  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expand significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our operating results

effective june   we began to recognize sales of our wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment by the distributors to the end user customer 
prior to june   we recognized revenue for sales of wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment to the distributor and provided reserves for the estimated amount of product returns 
the combination of the changes resulting from the acquisition of the agere systems wlan business and the adoption of one uniform method is consistent with our plans to sell bundled and integrated wlan and wwan products 
this change in accounting methodology was treated as a change in estimate  and was made on a prospective basis starting in the third quarter of revenue from services  such as pre installation diagnostic testing and product repair services  is recognized over the period for which the services are performed  which is typically less than one month 
revenue from product rentals is recognized over the period of the rental 

table of contents revenue consists of product revenues  reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances for price protection 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances  which are based on historical trends  contractual terms and other available information  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we classify our products into two product lines wireless wide area network  or wwan  product line  and  wireless local area network  or wlan  product line 
the wwan product line includes point to point lynx and tsunami products and point to multipoint tsunami products 
the wlan product line includes a and orinoco products 
prior to the march  merger with proxim  inc  we did not have a wlan product line 
historical wlan revenue prior to march  of the former proxim  inc and prior to august  for the orinoco products acquired from agere are not reported in the table below 
revenue information by product line is as follows in thousands year ended december  product line wwan product revenue wlan product revenue wlan license revenue total revenue one distributor  tech data corporation  accounted for of total revenue during the year ended december  another distributor  comstor  accounted for of total revenue during the year ended december  total revenue increased from million in to million in total revenue included product revenue and a one time patent license fee of million recorded in the first quarter of  resulting from the patent litigation settlement with intersil  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the license revenue of million in  total revenue increased primarily due to the increase in wlan product revenue attributable in part to the acquisition of the orinoco product line of agere systems on august   resulting in the contribution of that product line revenue for the full year in compared to five months in  and in part to the overall growth in wi fi spending in the increase in wlan product revenue was partially offset by a decrease in wwan product revenue primarily attributable to the continued weakness in telecom spending in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of outsourced manufacturing costs  component costs  labor and overhead costs  costs of acquiring finished parts from original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers  customer service and warranty costs 
we currently outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management to a limited number of independent contract manufacturers  who obtain components for our products from suppliers 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these contract manufacturers and component suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenue is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  final assembly  testing and product integration 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs as we continue to outsource more of our in house manufacturing as well as have our products produced at lower cost off shore locations 
however  we cannot assure you when or if cost reductions will occur 
the failure to achieve these cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in to in the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in wlan product sales in  as wlan products generally carry lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue than wwan products 
royalty charges 
on september   we announced that a jury had rendered a verdict in the first phase of the patent infringement suit with symbol 
on symbol s claims of patent infringement  the jury found that certain of our products infringe two of symbol s patents and assessed a royalty on the revenue of relevant products 
while the actual amount of past royalties due has not been finally determined  we recorded an accrual for estimated potential royalty charges of million and million for interest during the third 
table of contents quarter of and an accrual for estimated potential royalty charges of million and  for interest during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the symbol litigation 
restructuring provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million provision for excess and obsolete inventory as part of our restructuring activities 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past  we had built inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and entered into longer term commitments for certain components 
the excess inventory charges were due to the following factors a sudden and significant decrease in demand for certain lynx and tsunami license exempt point to point  a and harmony products  notification from customers that they would not be ordering as much as they had previously indicated  continued decline in the demand for fixed wireless solutions due to the worldwide slowdown in the telecom industry  continued increase in competition for wireless networking products  particularly related to home networking and enterprise lans  and management s strategy to discontinue products  and in certain cases replace those products with newer or redesigned products 
due to these factors  inventory levels exceeded our requirements based on current month sales forecasts 
the additional excess and obsolete inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of the estimated month demand for each specific product family 
we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory subject to this reserve will be used at a later date based on our current month demand forecast 
we use a month demand forecast because the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological changes such that if we have not sold a product after a month period it is unlikely that the product will be sold 
the following is a summary of the movements in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory during the year ended december  in thousands balance as of december  additional reserve for excess and obsolete inventory inventory scrapped balance as of december  research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype development expenses  consultant fees and allocated overhead related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and underlying technologies 
we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased from in to in the decrease in research and development expense in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the reduction in workforce implemented in the second quarter of  resulting in decreased personnel and related expenses in the final three quarters of compared to those expenses in the same period of these expense reductions were partially offset by increased personnel costs in the first quarter of compared to those expenses in the first quarter of  due to employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  product marketing  sales support functions  advertising  trade show and other promotional expenses and allocated overhead 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged from to selling  general and administrative expenses increased from the first half of to the first half of primarily due to increases in sales and marketing personnel expenses  due to 
table of contents employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere 
comparative increases in expenses in the first half of were offset by decreased expenses in the second half of compared to those in the second half of  primarily due to the workforce reduction implemented in the second quarter of legal expense for certain litigation 
during the year ended december   we incurred litigation expense of million primarily in connection with our litigation with symbol technologies 
please refer to item  legal proceedings for a description of this litigation 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased from million in to million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased primarily due to the intangible assets acquired from both the merger with proxim  inc on march  and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere on august  amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in connection with deferred stock compensation previously recorded for the sale of stock and issuance of options at prices deemed to be below fair market value 
as of december   deferred stock compensation was fully amortized 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in december  due to the significant decline in forecasted revenue and the cash flows therefrom  we made a complete assessment of the carrying value of all goodwill and other intangibles assets in accordance with sfas no 
first  we determined the fair value of our equity to be less than the carrying value of goodwill 
as such  an impairment charge was applicable in accordance with sfas no 
as of december  then we quantified the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset 
the carrying value of goodwill totaling million as of december  exceeded the estimated fair value of million and  accordingly  we took a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
in december  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that no further impairment charge was required 
impairment of loan to officer 
prior to  proxim  inc had guaranteed up to million of obligations of a former officer of the company  with respect to a margin loan with an investment bank 
we assumed the guaranty in the merger with proxim  inc and on october   the investment bank called our guaranty of million 
we continue to seek repayment from the former officer under a reimbursement and security agreement 
in this regard  in january  the former officer made a cash payment of million to us with the proceeds of a second mortgage on his home 
we assessed the recoverability of the remaining balance of the loan with respect to the former officer s current financial position and recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment charge does not constitute forgiveness of the former officer s indebtedness to us 
future payments by the former officer under the reimbursement and security agreement will be recorded as income in the period cash is received 
bad debt expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of bad debt expense in connection with a customer s accounts receivable deemed to be uncollectible 
these uncollectible accounts relate to products we had previously sold to the customer and that were subsequently discontinued 
restructuring charges benefit for severance and excess facilities 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million of cash provisions and million of non cash provisions for abandoned property and equipment  partially offset by a million net reversal of restructuring accruals 
the million of cash provisions consisted of million of operating lease commitments  less estimated future sublease receipts  and exit costs of certain closed facilities  million of severance payments for employees  million of consulting fees  and million of project commitments 
the million net reversal of restructuring accruals represented the reversal of million of previously recorded lease obligation restructuring reserves  partially offset by the write down of fair value of an asset held for sale of million 
we reversed a total of million of restructuring reserves  of which million related to buying and selling a leased property in sunnyvale  california during 
table of contents the fourth quarter of we reversed an additional million of previously recorded restructuring reserves related to another building lease in sunnyvale as a result of a reduction of the lease commitments agreed to with the lessor 
the following table summarizes the restructuring activities during the years ended december  and in thousands asset held severance facilities for sale other total balance as of december  reclassifications among categories balance acquired with proxim  inc provision charged to operations non cash charges utilized cash payments balance as of december  provision charged to operations reversal of previously recorded provision non cash charges utilized cash payments proceeds from sale of asset held for sale  net balance as of december  the restructuring reserves are presented on the balance sheet as follows in thousands december  restructuring accruals current long term total purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development or ipr d consists primarily of acquired technology that has not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the ipr d projects 
the million expensed to purchased in process research and development in related to next generation enterprise access points  radio backbone systems  broadband gateways and network management products acquired in the acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  technology for next generation asics acquired in the nband acquisition and a and homerf wireless networking products acquired related to the proxim  inc merger 
no purchased in process research and development charge was recorded in the year ended december  interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net increased from expense of  in to expense of million in the increase in interest expense is mainly attributable to interest charges recorded in connection with the estimated  potential royalty charges in connection with our patent infringement litigation with symbol  the promissory notes issued in july and december  and the deferred financing costs  together with a decrease in interest income as a result of lower applicable return rates 

table of contents loss on early extinguishment of debt 
as fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  upon stockholders approval in december  the convertible promissory notes of million were modified as they now include warrants to purchase million shares of common stock  and a right to convert to series b preferred stock at the option of the investors 
we determined under emerging issues task force  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  that the modification was made with substantially different terms and a debt extinguishment is resulted 
accordingly  the december note instrument was recorded at fair value and that amount was used to determine the debt extinguishment loss to be recognized and the effective rate of the new instrument 
the warrants were also recorded at fair value see note to the consolidated financial statements for details 
a loss of debt extinguishment of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of income tax provision benefit 
the income tax provision for was primarily due to establishing a full valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets brought forward from december  we were able to carry back certain losses to prior years  and claim income tax refunds totaling million  of which million has been received through september  the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets will be dependent on us generating taxable income in the future 
as a result of the operating losses incurred in recent periods  we have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have established a full valuation allowance of approximately million  of which million was recorded in additional paid in capital as the related asset was related to the recapitalization in deemed series a preferred stock dividend 
in august  in connection with the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere systems  inc  warburg pincus private equity viii  lp  broadview capital partners lp and affiliated entities agreed to collectively invest million in us 
these investors received  shares of series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock in the amount of approximately million  with a conversion price of approximately per share 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the series a preferred stock 
at the time of the conversion in august  a deemed preferred stock dividend representing the beneficial conversion feature of the series a preferred stock of million was also recorded to increase the loss attributable to holders of our common stock 
accretion of series a preferred stock redemption obligations 
the accretion of series a preferred stock represents the quarterly adjustments to the carrying value of the series a preferred stock  on an effective interest basis  so that the carrying value will equal the redemption amount at the earliest redemption date 
the accretion was recorded to increase the net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the accretion increased from million to million from the year ended december  to  primarily because the amount represents four months of accretion in starting in august and a full year of accretion in comparison of years ended december  and revenue  net 
revenue information by product line is as follows in thousands year ended december  product line wwan wlan total revenue three distributors comstor  somera communications  inc and tessco technologies accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  one distributor comstor accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  revenue increased from million in to million in revenue increased primarily due to the contribution of sales of wlan products totaling million acquired in both the 
table of contents merger with proxim  inc on march  and the acquisition of the systems business from agere on august  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in wwan product sales 
the decrease in wwan product sales was attributable  in part  to the adoption of a uniform sell through revenue recognition methodology for products that are sold through distribution channels with rights of return 
this accounting methodology change was implemented on a prospective basis effective june   and resulted in the deferral of million of revenue from wwan products shipped to distributors as of december   that were not sold through to end customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in to in the increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the contribution of sales from wlan products acquired in both the merger with proxim  inc and the acquisition of the wlan systems business from agere systems 
wlan products generally carry lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue than wwan products 
restructuring provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  including purchase commitments  totaling million during as part of our restructuring charge  of which million related to excess and obsolete inventory and million related to purchase commitments 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past  we built inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and entered into longer term commitments for certain components 
the excess inventory charges were due to the following factors a sudden and significant decrease in demand for certain lynx and tsunami license exempt point to point products  notification from customers that they would not be ordering as much as they had previously indicated  management s strategy to discontinue the lynx and tsunami point to point licensed products in order to concentrate on the license exempt products  and management s strategy to discontinue certain lynx and tsunami license exempt products in order to concentrate on selling next generation lynx and tsunami license exempt products 
due to these factors  inventory levels exceeded our requirements based on current month sales forecasts 
the additional excess and obsolete inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of the estimated month demand for each specific product family 
we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory subject to this reserve will be used at a later date based on our current month demand forecast 
we use a month demand forecast because the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological changes such that if we have not sold a product after a month period it is unlikely that the product will be sold 
the following is a summary of the movements in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory during balance as of december  additional reserve for excess and obsolete inventory balance acquired with proxim  inc inventory scrapped balance as of december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the cost of increased personnel  including employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  prototype spending for the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in to in primarily due to increased personnel expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing personnel expenses  including employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  advertising  tradeshow  and public relations expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the percentage decrease was primarily due to increased revenue and efforts to control costs  including the reductions of headcount and discretionary spending 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased from million in to million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased primarily due to the increased intangible assets from both the merger with proxim  inc on march  and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere offset by the cessation of amortization of goodwill arose from acquisitions completed prior to june  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
beginning on january  amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased from million in to million in amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased primarily due to the issuance of stock options at fair value since the completion of our initial public offering in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in december  due to the recent significant decline in forecasted revenue and the cash flows therefrom  we made a complete assessment of the carrying value of all goodwill and other intangibles assets in accordance with sfas no 
first  we determined the fair value of its equity to be less than the carrying value of goodwill 
as such  an impairment charge was applicable in accordance with sfas no 
as of december  then we quantified the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset 
the carrying value of goodwill totaling million as of december  exceeded the estimated fair value of million and  accordingly  we took a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
impairment of loan to officer 
prior to  proxim  inc had guaranteed up to million of obligations of an officer of the company  with respect to a margin loan with an investment bank 
we assumed the guaranty in the merger with proxim  inc and on october   the investment bank called our guaranty of million 
we continue to seek repayment from the officer under a reimbursement and security agreement 
in this regard  in january  the officer made a cash payment of million to us with the proceeds of a second mortgage on his home 
we assessed the recoverability of the remaining balance of the loan with respect to the officer s current financial position and recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment charge does not constitute forgiveness of the officer s indebtedness to us 
future payments by the officer under the reimbursement and security agreement will be recorded as income in the period cash is received 
restructuring charges 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges  including million  million  million and million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  related to closure of certain facilities  discontinued product lines and severance pay

interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net decreased from income of million in to expense of  in the increase in interest expense is mainly attributable to interest on the convertible promissory notes issued in august and decreased interest income due to lower applicable return rates on cash balances 
income tax provision benefit 
the income tax provision for was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance in the first quarter of to offset deferred tax assets brought forward from december  in assessing our ability to realize deferred income tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result of the losses incurred  there is significant uncertainty  as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our deferred tax assets in the year ended december  our income tax provision was million for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the effective rates in and were higher than federal statutory rate of plus the state tax rate of  net of federal benefits  primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance  expenses related to charges for goodwill impairment  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  purchased in process research and development and equity investments that were not deductible for income tax purposes

this building was vacated in july  and the net expected lease costs were included in the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of  totaling approximately million through the expiration of the lease in  net of expected sublease proceeds 
the rent rates of this lease were substantially greater than the current local market lease rates  and this unused space represented a negative cash flow of approximately  per quarter 
we were not able to sublease the building since it was vacated in july since november  we ceased making direct lease payments  and the building owner utilized our cash security deposit to cover the monthly payments and other lease charges

litigation with symbol technologies on september   we announced that a jury had rendered a verdict in the first phase of the patent infringement suit with symbol 
on symbol s claims of patent infringement  the jury found that certain of our products infringe two of symbol s patents and assessed a royalty 
while the actual amount of past royalties due has not been finally determined  we recorded an accrual for estimated potential royalty charges of million and million for interest during the third quarter of and an accrual for estimated potential royalty charges of million and  for interest during the fourth quarter of we have not been enjoined from continued sales of these products 
we will continue to evaluate and review its estimate of the royalties and interest payable from time to time for any indications that could require us to change our assumptions relating to the amount already recorded 
on november   the district court conducted a 
table of contents one day bench trial on our equitable defenses of laches and estoppel not addressed by the jury 
the district court has not reached a decision on the equitable defenses 
if the proceedings before the court in the litigation with symbol are not decided in our favor  we would likely be required to make significant payments to symbol  including payments for royalties related to past sales of products found to infringe and additional royalties in connection with future sales of these products  or we would be required to post a bond in order to appeal the court s decision 
any adverse ruling or judgment in this litigation that requires us to render payment or post a bond equal to or greater than million  and any other ruling or judgment in this or any other litigation that is material and adverse to us  triggers an event of default under the notes 
upon such occurrence  the investors would have the ability to require us to repay the notes 
in addition  any judgment  restraining order  injunction or any material adverse development in this litigation triggers an event of default under the silicon valley bank credit facility 
upon such occurrence  silicon valley bank would have the ability to require us to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit facility and to prohibit us from borrowing any additional amounts 
depending upon the final ruling of the litigation with symbol  we may be required to pay royalty charges and interest at the time specified by the court 
our current estimate of approximately million for royalties and interest is not included in the above disclosure of future payments under contractual obligations 
additional sources of financing we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations during the years ended december   and  and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  if we were required to make payments to symbol  post a bond to the court  and or repay the notes and amounts  if any  owed to silicon valley bank  either due to an event of default or otherwise  we would be required to obtain immediate alternative sources of financing 
if we were not able to obtain an alternative source of financing  we would most likely have insufficient cash to pay these obligations  be unable to meet our ongoing operating obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business  and seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us will not be required nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time or times as required by us 
we may need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations  strengthen our financial position  meet our working capital requirements  or take advantage of market opportunities 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to us  such as the terms of the notes and our other agreements with the investors  as well as factors beyond our control  including market uncertainty and conditions in the capital markets 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and any need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional  and perhaps significant dilution

table of contents our quarterly revenue and loss from operations results have varied and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the following the effectiveness of our distribution channels and the success in maintaining our current distribution channels and developing new distribution channels  our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets  seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  the sell through rate of our orinoco products acquired in our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business through consumer retail channels  market adoption of radio frequency  or rf  standards based products such as those compliant with the ieee b  ieee a  ieee g  ieee b or ieee specifications  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  the sell through rate of our wlan and wwan products through commercial distribution channels  market demand for our point to point lynx and tsunami systems  market demand for our tsunami point to multipoint systems  our ability to effectively manage product transitions to newer product platform designs  the mix of products sold because our products generate different gross margins  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure  difficulties in expanding and conducting international operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the wireless communications industry 
we have experienced disruptions in our operations from some of the factors listed above and may experience them again 
in addition  we are dependent on decisions by service providers  businesses and other enterprises to build wireless networks 
these decisions are in turn dependent upon the success and expected demand for the services offered by those service providers  businesses and other enterprises 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short term 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
seasonality historically  our product revenues have been higher in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition  our product revenues have historically been significantly higher in the last month of each quarter 
this shift may primarily be attributed to the budgetary constraints of the customers in our industry and weather conditions that make an outdoor installation more difficult during the winter

table of contents we are not profitable and may not be profitable in the future 
for the year ended december  we had a million net loss attributable to holders of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or continue at current levels or growth rates or that we will achieve profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the limited histories of western multiplex  proxim  inc and the agere wireless systems business we acquired  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicating what our future performance will be 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant sales  marketing  product development and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate increased revenue to achieve profitability and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue or control costs as we implement our product and distribution strategies would harm our ability to achieve profitability and the operating results and financial condition of the business 
our gross profit may decline in the future 
our gross profit is affected by both the average selling prices of our systems and our cost of revenue 
historically  decreases in our average selling prices have generally been offset by reductions in our per unit product cost 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will achieve any reductions in per unit product cost in the future or that any reductions will offset a reduction in our average selling prices 
gross profit will be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  the degree to which our manufacturing is outsourced  the location of manufacturing  cost reduced product designs  future manufacturing licenses of our products  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the degree of customization of individual products required by oem customers and component and assembly costs 
the terms of the notes issued to the investors may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of million to warburg pincus and broadview capital 
these notes are accruing interest at an annual rate of 
please refer to part i  item  business recent financing activities for a detailed description of these recent transactions and the terms of the notes and our amended agreement with these investors 
the terms of the notes and the amended agreement may impair our ability to secure additional financing from other sources 
while the notes are outstanding  we may not generally  without the prior written consent of the investors holding a majority of the principal amount of the notes incur certain liabilities or indebtedness for money borrowed  subject to certain limited exceptions  grant or permit any liens  pledges or encumbrances on any of our assets  subject to limited exceptions  sell any material part of our assets  other than in limited circumstances or in the ordinary course of business  or pay or declare any dividend or distribution 

table of contents we have a limited operating history with some of our current product lines  which makes your evaluation of our business difficult and will affect many aspects of our business 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in developing industries  particularly companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include an evolving and unpredictable business model  uncertain acceptance of our new orinoco  lynx and tsunami products  competition  and challenges in managing growth 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in addressing these risks 
if we fail to do so  our revenue and operating results could be materially harmed 
we may experience fluctuations in operating results and may not be able to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which may cause operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which will be outside our control 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to planned expenditures could materially harm our operating results and financial condition  and may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this happens  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
factors that may harm operating results include the effectiveness of our distribution channels and the success in maintaining our current distribution channels  the effectiveness of developing new distribution channels  our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets  seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations  market adoption of radio frequency  or rf  standards based products such as those compliant with the ieee b  ieee a  ieee g  ieee or ieee 
specifications  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements  the sell through rate of our wlan and wwan products through commercial distribution channels  market demand for our point to point lynx and tsunami systems  market demand for our point to multipoint tsunami systems  our ability to effectively manage product transitions from one generation of product platforms to newer product platform designs  including inventories on hand  product certifications  and customer transitions  the mix of products sold because our products generate different gross margins  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure  
table of contents difficulties in expanding and conducting international operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the wireless communications industry 
historically  we do not operate with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of our revenues in any quarter are derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  a significant component of our revenue expectations will be based almost entirely on internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates 
if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this regard  we did not achieve our revenue targets in the first and second quarters of our operating results have been  and could further be  adversely affected as a result of purchase accounting treatment and the impact of amortization and impairment of intangible assets relating to the merger and the agere asset purchase 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we accounted for our merger with proxim  inc using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have recorded the market value of our common stock issued in connection with the merger  the fair value of the options to purchase proxim  inc and the agere asset purchase  the common stock that became options to purchase proxim corporation common stock and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of combining with proxim  inc and the agere asset purchase 
we have allocated the cost of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology and acquired trademarks and trade names and in process research and development  based on their respective fair values at the date of the completion of the merger 
intangible assets are required to be amortized prospectively over their estimated useful lives 
the purchase price was allocated to deferred compensation  based on the portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested proxim  inc options we have assumed to the extent that service is required after completion of the merger in order to vest 
any excess of the purchase price over those fair market values will be accounted for as goodwill 
we are not required to amortize goodwill against income but goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets will be subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
in this regard  due to the decline in forecasted revenue in future periods  we took a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of the impairment charged was measured as the amount that the carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value 
if we are required to recognize additional impairment charges  the charge will negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 
shares eligible for future sale  including shares owned by our principal stockholders  may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our investors hold outstanding shares of series a preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock as of march  including additional accretion at an annual rate of through august   the series a preferred stock will be convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the investors also hold notes exchangeable for shares of our series b preferred stock  which is then convertible into our common stock 
assuming exchange of the notes on their maturity date of september   the investors will receive series b preferred stock immediately convertible into  shares of our common stock 
including additional accretion at an annual rate of through the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance of the series b preferred stock  the series b preferred stock will be convertible into  shares of our common stock 
in addition  the investors currently hold warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share   shares of common 
table of contents stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
assuming conversion of the notes  the series b preferred stock issuable upon conversion of the notes  the series a preferred stock  and the warrants held by the series a and series b preferred stock investors  would be expected to represent approximately of our outstanding capital stock on an as converted and as exercised basis  based on shares outstanding as of march   and excluding outstanding employee options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
we have agreed to file a registration statement on form s  or  if available  form s  with the securities and exchange commission the sec within days following the filing of this annual report on form k with the sec 
upon the effectiveness of such registration statement  the investors will have the right to resell any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock and upon exercise of all of the warrants 
in addition to these securities  as of december   options and warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock were outstanding 
also  as of december   approximately an additional  shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our employees under existing and or assumed stock option plans 
competition within the wireless networking industry is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results 
the market for broadband wireless systems and wireless local area networking and building to building markets are extremely competitive and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors affecting wireless local area networking and fixed wireless markets include the following data throughput  effective rf coverage area  interference immunity  network security  network scalability  price  integration with voice technology  wireless networking protocol sophistication  ability to support industry standards  roaming capability  power consumption  product miniaturization  product reliability  ease of use  product costs  product features and applications  product time to market  product certifications  changes to government regulations with respect to each country served and related to the use of radio spectrum  brand recognition  oem partnerships  marketing alliances  manufacturing capabilities and experience  effective distribution channels  and company reputation 
we could be at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors  particularly symbol  cisco systems linksys  netgear and d link  that have broader distribution channels  greater brand recognition  more extensive patent portfolios and  in particular  more diversified product lines 
in the broadband wireless access market  we have several competitors  including without limitation  alvarion  ceragon networks  stratex networks  and harris corporation 
we face competition from numerous companies that have developed competing products in both the commercial wireless and home networking markets  including several asia based companies offering low price ieee a b g products 
we are also facing future competition from companies that offer products which replace network adapters or offer alternative communications solutions such as the integrated wireless functionality on the intel centrino computer chip  or from large computer companies  pc peripheral companies  as well as other large networking equipment companies that integrate network adapters into their products 
furthermore  we could face competition from certain of our oem customers  which have  or could acquire  wireless engineering and product development capabilities  or might elect to offer competing technologies 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors or those competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the wlan and building to building markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or 
table of contents otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
furthermore  we compete with companies that have high volume manufacturing and extensive marketing and distribution capabilities  areas in which we have only limited experience 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
wireless networking markets are subject to rapid technological change and to compete  we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
we have expended substantial resources in developing products that are designed to conform to the ieee standards 
there can be no assurance  however  that the ieee compliant products will have an ongoing meaningful commercial impact 
already  even within the standard  there have been significant technological changes 
the ieee approved the ghz wlan standard designated b 
in  the ieee approved the ghz wlan standard designated a 
in  the ieee approved a new ghz wlan standard designated g 
ieee is in the process of establishing additional standards  including e related to quality of service for voice and video transmission  i related to enhanced security  and h related to dynamic frequency selection and transmission power control 
furthermore  ieee has recently committed to developing new wireless wan standards under two separate initiatives  wimax and  standards which when finalized will produce transmission distances measured in kilometers 
while we have products based on the a  b and g standards  future standards developments may make these technologies obsolete and require significant additional investment by the company 
as an example  in august  the fcc adopted a rule change to part based on the rule change  we made significant investments in developing higher speed frequency hopping technology that allowed for wider band hopping channels and increased the data rate from mbps to up to mbps based on the homerf standard 
however  widespread adoption of products based on the ieee standard have lead us to discontinue these products 
there can be no assurance that a similar future change in industry standards and market acceptance will not require us to abandon our current product lines and invest significantly in research and development of future standards based products 
given the emerging nature of the wlan market  there can be no assurance that the products and technology  or our other products or technology  will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies  including cellular 
currently  cellular companies are developing rd generation technologies designed to transmit data at up to mbps 
in particular  verizon has already announced an initiative based on this technology known as ev do 
cellular technology today has an inherent advantage of being more ubiquitous than wlan hotspot technology 
there can be no assurance that the companies current product offerings will be competitive with cellular or other wlan technologies in the future 
in addition  when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
these actions could materially adversely affect our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
as the market for our wireless networking products is evolving  we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate or are compatible with these new technologies as they emerge 
if we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 

table of contents our revenue may decline and our ability to achieve profitability may be threatened if the demand for wireless services in general and broadband wireless access systems in particular does not continue to grow 
our success is dependent on the continued trend toward wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue may decline 
unlike some competitors such as cisco systems including linksys  netgear and com  our principal product offerings rely on wireless technologies 
accordingly  we would experience a greater impact from a decline in the demand for wireless services than some of our most important competitors 
in addition  wireless access solutions are unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies  such as our tsunami point to multipoint technology and technologies in which we have invested substantial capital  were only commercially introduced in the last few years 
in addition  we are also investing in the development of products that comply with the emerging wireless access standard 
if wireless access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  it is unlikely we could generate enough sales to achieve and sustain profitability 
we have listed below the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of broadband wireless access technology its reliability and security and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  its capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  its cost effectiveness and performance compared to other forms of broadband access  whose prices and performance continue to improve  its suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and the availability of sufficient site locations for network service providers to install products at commercially reasonable rates 
we have experienced the effects of many of the factors listed above in interactions with customers selecting wireless versus wire line technology 
for example  because of the frequency with which individuals using cellular phones experience fading or a loss of signal  customers often hold the perception that all broadband wireless technologies will have the same reliability constraints even though the wireless technology we use does not have the same problems as cellular phones 
in some geographic areas  because of adverse weather conditions that affect wireless transmissions  but not wire line technologies  we are not able to sell products as successfully as competitors with wire line technology 
in addition  future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
we may also lose customers to different types of wireless technologies 
many of our products operate in the unlicensed frequency bands  in compliance with various governmental regulations 
in addition  many of the emerging wireless standards utilize these unlicensed frequency bands 
the proliferation and market acceptance of unlicensed wireless products increases the probability of interference among unlicensed devices 
increasing interference can adversely affect the operation of our unlicensed products  resulting in customers selecting alternative products that do not operate in these unlicensed frequency bands 
for example  we have only a limited offering of products that operate in licensed radio spectrums 
some customers  however  may want to operate in licensed radio spectrums because they sometimes offer less interference than license free radio spectrums or have other advantages 
we depend on international sales and our ability to sustain or expand international sales is subject to many risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
during the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for approximately and of our total sales  respectively 
we expect that our revenue from shipments to international 
table of contents customers will vary as a percentage of total revenue 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including the following uncertainty of product acceptance by customers in foreign countries  difficulty in assessing the ability to collect on orders to be shipped in an uncertain economic environment  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  export license and documentation requirements  unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations  governmental restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states  foreign currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles for international distributors  tariffs  duties taxes and other trade barriers  difficulties in finding foreign licensees or joint venture partners  and potential political and economic instability 
there is a risk that such factors will harm our ability to continue to successfully operate internationally and our efforts to expand international operations 
in this regard  our revenue levels have been affected  in part  by reduced ability to ship our products to international customers in cases where collectibility  based on a number of factors  could not be reasonably assured 
while we may extend limited credit terms  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
there can be no assurance that foreign markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional orders to supply our products to foreign customers 
our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop or if we do not receive additional orders to supply our products for use by foreign customers 
to successfully expand international sales  we will need to recruit additional international sales and support personnel and expand our relationships with international distributors and value added resellers 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we may incur these additional costs and add these management burdens without successfully expanding sales 
this failure would harm our operating results 
uncertainties and heightened security associated with the aftermath of war in iraq and the ongoing war on terrorism may continue to adversely affect domestic and international demand for our products  result in a further deterioration of global economic conditions  and increase shipment times and costs for our products 
the economic uncertainty resulting from hostilities in iraq may continue to negatively impact consumer and business confidence 
in recent periods  general economic conditions in the us caused and may continue to cause us businesses to slow spending on products and to delay sales cycles 
similarly  global economic conditions could cause foreign businesses to slow or halt spending on our products 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our products outside the us  and we may experience delays in the delivery of our products or increased shipping costs as a result of increased security measures 
this economic uncertainty may make it more difficult to continue to implement our business strategy and could adversely impact future operating results 

table of contents our business will depend on rapidly evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development 
we cannot assure you that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that has resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  will continue at its current rate or at all 
we may be dependent on and receive a significant percentage of our revenue from a limited number of oem customers 
a limited number of oem customers may contribute a significant percentage of our revenue 
we expect that sales to a limited number of oem customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
sales of many of our wireless networking products depend upon decisions of prospective oem customers to develop and market wireless solutions that incorporated our wireless technology 
oem customers orders are affected by a variety of factors  including the following new product introductions  end user demand for oem customers products  joint development efforts  oem customers product life cycles  inventory levels  market and oem customers adoption of new wireless standards  manufacturing strategies  lengthy design in cycles  pricing  regulatory changes  contract awards  and competitive situations 
the loss of one or more of  or a significant reduction in orders from  our major oem customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results or stock price 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will become a qualified supplier for new oem customers or that we will remain a qualified supplier for existing oem customers 
our wwan business derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of distributors 
therefore  a decrease or loss in business from any of them may cause a significant delay or decline in our revenue and could harm our reputation 
our wwan business has historically generated a significant amount of revenue from a limited number of distributors 
the loss of business from any of these distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our revenue  delay recognition of revenue  harm our reputation or reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow 
one distributor accounted for approximately and of our total revenue in and the year ended  respectively 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these distributors 
while we expect to have a more diversified and expansive end customer base  the future success of our business will depend significantly on the timing and size of future 
table of contents purchase orders  if any  from a limited number of distributors 
in addition  as we continue the development of our distribution channels  we may consolidate demand through fewer  larger distributors in order to effectively manage a growing base of vars  resellers and sub distributors 
we depend on limited suppliers for key components that are difficult to manufacture  and because we may not have long term arrangements with these suppliers  we could experience disruptions in supply that could decrease or delay the recognition of revenues 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in our products 
proxim  inc and agere depended on single sources for our proprietary application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and assembled circuit boards 
any disruptions in the supply of these components or assemblies could delay or decrease our revenues 
in addition  even for components with multiple sources  there have been  and may continue to be  shortages due to capacity constraints caused by high demand 
we do not have any long term arrangements with our suppliers and could be at a disadvantage compared to other companies  particularly larger companies  that have contractual rights or preferred purchasing arrangements 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quantity or quality requirements  or stops selling components to us or our contract manufacturers at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product reputation problems 
because the key components and assemblies of our products are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times  we may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers to produce our components and assemblies on a timely basis 
we have experienced shortages of some of these components in the past  which delayed related revenue  and we may experience shortages in the future 
in addition  because the majority of our products have a short sales cycle of between and days  we may have difficulty in making accurate and reliable forecasts of product needs 
as a result  we could experience shortages in supply  which could delay or decrease revenue because our customers may cancel their orders or choose a competitor for their future needs 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities and we will need to increasingly depend on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements 
we have limited manufacturing capability and limited experience in large scale or foreign manufacturing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
in addition  in order to compete successfully  we will need to achieve significant product cost reductions 
although we intend to achieve cost reductions through engineering improvements  production economies  and manufacturing at lower cost locations including outside the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment  and there can be no assurance that any such new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
for example  as part of our restructuring charge in the second quarter of  we increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory by million  primarily related to legacy wwan products 
as a part of our restructuring charge in the first quarter of  we increased our provision for obsolete and excess inventory  including purchase commitments  totaling million  of which million related to excess inventory and million related to purchase commitments  primarily related to legacy wlan products 
these provisions related to a decrease in demand for certain products as well as our strategy to discontinue certain products in order to concentrate on selling next generation products 
we rely on contract and subcontract manufacturers for turnkey manufacturing and circuit board assemblies which subjects us to additional risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards and reduced control over the price  timely delivery and quality of such finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards 
if our sunnyvale facility were to become incapable of operating  even temporarily  or were unable to operate at or near our current or full capacity for an extended period  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
changes in our manufacturing operations to incorporate new products and processes  or to manufacture at lower cost locations outside the united states  could cause disruptions  which  in turn  could adversely affect customer relationships  cause a loss of market opportunities and negatively affect our business and 
table of contents operating results 
in addition  our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the risk that these manufacturers may terminate their relationship with us  may choose not to devote adequate capacity to produce our products or may delay production of our products 
if any of these risks are realized  we could experience an interruption in supply  which could have an adverse impact on the timing and amount our revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively transition these products  which  in turn  could adversely affect customer relationships  cause a loss of market opportunities and negatively affect our business and operating results 
our reliance on contract manufacturers could subject us to additional costs or delays in product shipments as demand for our products increases or decreases 
some contract manufacturers have decreased their operations in response to an overall contraction in demand for wireless networking products 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies or the loss of a contract manufacturer would result in costs to acquire additional manufacturing capacity and delays in shipments of our products  materially adversely affecting our business and operating results 
in addition  cancellations in orders as a result of decreases in demand for products may subject us to claims for damages 
in this regard  we are party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of suppliers and vendors 
these disputes relate primarily to excess materials and order cancellation claims that resulted from declines in demand for our products during and and the commensurate reductions in manufacturing volumes 
we may be unable to achieve the manufacturing cost reductions and improvements required in order to achieve or maintain profitability 
in general  the average selling prices of our products decline over time 
if we do not reduce production costs and other expenses  we may not be able to offset this continuing decline and achieve or maintain profitability 
we must also develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and features that can be sold at higher average selling prices or produced at lower costs 
failure to decrease the cost of our products or to effectively develop new systems would cause our revenue to decline or to increase more slowly 
we expect that average selling prices of our products will continue to decrease because one of our strategies is to increase the percentage of domestic and international sales being made through distributors and value added resellers  and to oem customers  which involve lower prices than our direct sales 
this risk from declining average selling prices may also intensify because we expect that market conditions  particularly falling prices for competing broadband solutions  will force us to reduce prices over time 
under some circumstances  we may be forced to reduce prices even if it causes us to decrease gross profit or to take a loss on our products 
we may also be unable to reduce sufficiently the cost of our products to enable us to compete with other broadband access technologies with lower product costs 
in order to remain competitive  we will need to design our products so that they can be manufactured with low cost  automated manufacturing  assembly and testing techniques 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in designing our products to allow contract manufacturers to use lower cost  automated techniques 
in addition  any redesign may fail to result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to significantly reduce the price of our products or prevent our gross profit from declining as prices decline 
because many of our current and planned products are or will be highly complex  they may contain defects or errors that are detectable only after deployment in complex networks and which  if detected  could harm our reputation  result in costs to us in excess of our estimates  adversely affect our operating results  result in a decrease in revenue or result in difficulty collecting accounts receivable 
many of our complex products can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
as a result  end users may discover defects or errors or experience breakdowns in their networks after the products 
table of contents have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects or errors in these products  including defects or errors in components supplied by our contract manufacturers  could result in failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share  cancellation of orders  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased service and warranty costs  diversion of resources  legal actions by customers and end users  and increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end users 
if we experience warranty failure that indicate either manufacturing or design deficiencies  we may be required to recall units in the field and or stop producing and shipping such products until the deficiency is identified and corrected 
in the event of such warranty failures  our business could be adversely affected resulting in reduced revenue  increased costs and decreased customer satisfaction 
because customers often delay deployment of a full system until the products have been tested by them and any defects have been corrected  we expect these revisions to cause delays in orders by our customers for our systems 
because our strategy is to introduce more complex products in the future  this risk will intensify over time 
end users have discovered errors in our products in the past and may discover errors in our products in the future 
if the costs of remediating problems experienced by our customers exceeds our warranty reserves  these costs may adversely affect our operating results 
to compete effectively  we will need to establish and expand new distribution channels for our point to point and point to multipoint products and wlan products 
we sell our products through domestic and international distributors 
in general  distributors  value added resellers and retailers offer products of several different companies  including products that may compete with our products 
accordingly  they may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing our efforts to sell our products 
in addition they often focus on specific markets and we will need to add new distributors and value added resellers as we expand our sales to new markets 
agreements with distributors and retailers are generally terminable at their option 
any reduction in sales efforts or termination of a relationship may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
use of distributors and retailers also entails the risk that they will build up inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales 
if such growth does not occur as anticipated  they may substantially decrease the amount of products ordered in subsequent quarters 
such fluctuations could contribute to significant variations in our future operating results 
broadband wireless access solutions have some disadvantages and limitations as compared to other alternative broadband access solutions that may prevent widespread adoption  which could hurt our prospects 
broadband wireless access solutions  including point to point and point to multipoint systems  compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our lynx and tsunami point to point and tsunami point to multipoint solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies 
moreover  current point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas  including the need for line of sight installation and  in the case of operating frequencies above ghz  reduced communication distance in bad weather 

table of contents we expect point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in broadband wireless access solutions 
broadband wireless access products require a direct line of sight  which may limit the ability of service providers to deploy them in a cost effective manner and could harm our sales 
because of line of sight limitations  service providers often install broadband wireless access equipment on the rooftops of buildings and on other tall structures 
before undertaking these installations  service providers must generally secure roof rights from the owners of each building or other structure on which the equipment is to be installed 
the inability to easily and cost effectively obtain roof rights may deter customers from choosing to install broadband wireless access equipment  which could have an adverse effect on our sales 
inability to attract and retain key personnel could hinder our ability to operate 
our success depends to a large extent on the continued services of mr 
frank plastina  our president and chief executive officer  mr 
david l 
thompson  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and other members of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of any of these management members could harm our business because of the crucial role each of them is expected to play in our operations and strategic development 
in order to be successful  we must also retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers 
experienced management and technical  sales  marketing and support personnel in the wireless networking industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
this is particularly the case in silicon valley  where our headquarters and a majority of our operations are located 
we may have difficulties with our acquisitions and investments  which could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would be accompanied by risks  including  among others requiring to invest a substantial amount of capital  which could materially harm our financial condition and ability to implement our existing business strategy  requiring to issue additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to our stockholders  placing additional and substantial burdens on our management personnel and financial and operational systems  the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  potential additional expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets or the impairment of goodwill  additional expenses associated with the activities and expansion of the acquired businesses  and the possible impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers  suppliers and investors

possible third party claims of infringement of proprietary rights against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
the communications industry is characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  any such claims  with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to our business and diversion of our personnel  require us to develop new technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us  and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or to license the infringed  misappropriated or similar technology at a reasonable cost  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may be obligated to indemnify our customers against claimed infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights of third parties 
any requirement to indemnify our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
should the outcome of our patent or other litigation be unfavorable  we may be required to pay damages and other expenses  or we could be enjoined from selling certain products  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
proxim  inc s involvement in patent litigation has resulted in  and could in the future continue to result in  substantial costs and diversion of management resources of the company 
in addition  this litigation  if determined adversely to us  could result in the payment of substantial damages and or royalties or prohibitions against utilization of essential technologies  and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
on december   symbol filed suit in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that proxim  inc infringed four symbol patents related to systems for packet data transmission 
symbol sought an award for unspecified damages and a permanent injunction against proxim  inc based on alleged patent infringement counterclaims 
on december   proxim  inc filed an answer and counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments for non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability of the four asserted symbol patents  injunctive and monetary relief for symbol s infringement of a proxim  inc patent  monetary relief for symbol s false patent marking  and injunctive and monetary relief for symbol s unfair competition under the lanham act  common law unfair competition and tortious interference 
on september   we announced that a jury had rendered a verdict in the first phase of the patent infringement suit with symbol 
on symbol s claims of patent infringement  the jury found that certain of our products infringe two of symbol s patents and assessed a royalty on our sales of these products from january  accordingly  we recorded an accrual for estimated royalties payable of million and million for interest during the third quarter of we have not been enjoined from continued sales of these products  and royalty payments  if any  on these sales have not been determined by the court 
in november  the court conducted a bench trial on our remaining equitable defenses not addressed by the jury and proceedings in the case continue we will continue to evaluate and review our estimate of the royalties 
table of contents and interest payable from time to time for any indications that could require us to change our assumptions relating to the amount already recorded 
in addition  we do not incur any immediate financial obligation to symbol as a result of this verdict  pending completion of related proceedings 
on march   we announced a settlement with intersil corporation to resolve all pending patent related litigation between the two companies 
under the terms of the agreement  proxim  inc and intersil have agreed to dismiss all claims against each other  including lawsuits before the international trade commission and delaware and massachusetts federal courts 
as part of the confidential settlement agreement  the two companies entered into a patent cross license agreement for their respective patent portfolios and intersil agreed to make a one time payment of million to us 
the two companies have also entered into a product supply agreement defining the terms under which we will be able to purchase products that utilize intersil s chipsets 
during the first quarter of  we recorded million as licensing revenue and million of legal expense as final settlement of outstanding legal fees and expenses related to the terminated patent litigation 
on or about march   we were served with a complaint filed on january   by top global technology limited top global  a distributor for agere systems singapore 
our demurrer to top global s complaint was sustained in may top global then filed and served an amended complaint on may  top global s lawsuit was filed against agere systems  inc  agere systems singapore  and agere systems asia pacific collectively  agere and us in the superior court for the state of california  county of santa clara 
top global claims that it is entitled to return for a credit million of products that it purchased from agere systems singapore in june as a result of our decision to discontinue a product line that we purchased from agere in august the amended complaint asks the court to determine whether agere or we are responsible for accepting the product return and issuing a million credit and also alleges breach of contract 
we answered the amended complaint and asserted several defenses to top global s claims 
in january  the parties mediated this dispute but were unable to reach a settlement 
in march  the court dismissed the contract claims against agere but at the same time granted top global s motion for leave to amend its complaint to allege a fraud claim against agere 
discovery continues and a trial setting conference is scheduled for may  on february   we received a copy of a complaint filed on february  in tokyo district court by active technology corporation  a japanese based distributor of our products 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that we sold to active certain defective products  which active in turn subsequently sold to its customers 
active seeks damages of million japanese yen  which includes the purchase price of the allegedly defective products and replacement costs allegedly incurred by active 
active seeks to offset the claim of million japanese yen against outstanding accounts payable by active of million japanese yen to us  resulting in a net claim against proxim corporation of million japanese yen 
translated into us dollars on march   active s net claim is approximately million 
this case is in its earliest stages  as discovery has not yet commenced and a trial date has not been established 
we are party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of suppliers and vendors 
these disputes relate primarily to excess materials and order cancellation claims that resulted from the declines in demand for our products during and and the commensurate reductions in manufacturing volumes 
we have recorded reserves related to these disputes to the extent that management believes are appropriate 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters 
the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain 
in the event of any adverse decision in the described legal actions or disputes  or any other related litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  we could be required to pay damages and other expenses  and  in the case of litigation related to patents or other intellectual property rights  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
we cannot make any assurance that these matters will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
in particular  if the proceedings before the court in our litigation with symbol are not decided in our favor  we would likely be required to make significant payments to symbol  including payments for royalties 
table of contents related to past sales of products found to infringe and additional royalties in connection with future sales of these products  or we would be required to post a bond in order to appeal the court s decision 
any adverse ruling or judgment in this litigation that requires us to render payment or post a bond equal to or greater than million  and any other ruling or judgment in this or any other litigation that is material and adverse to us  triggers an event of default under the notes issued to warburg pincus and affiliates of broadview capital 
upon such occurrence  the investors would have the ability to require us to repay the notes 
in addition  entry of any judgment  restraining order  injunction or any material adverse development in the litigation with symbol would result in an event of default under our secured credit facility with silicon valley bank 
upon such occurrence  silicon valley bank would have the ability to require us to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit facility and to prohibit us from borrowing any additional amounts 
if we were required to make payments to symbol  post a bond to the court  and or repay the notes and amounts  if any  owed to silicon valley bank  either due to an event of default or otherwise  we would be required to obtain immediate alternative sources of financing 
if we were not able to obtain an alternative source of financing  we would most likely have insufficient cash to pay these obligations  be unable to meet our ongoing operating obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business  and may have to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
the implementation of a new management information system may disrupt our business 
as a result of the merger between proxim and western multiplex  and the acquisition of agere systems wlan systems business during  we identified a requirement to consolidate and integrate our management information systems 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a new enterprise resource planning and financial accounting and planning system and began to integrate this new system with our customer relationship management system and our product management system  and to create electronic interfaces to certain supply chain partners information systems and certain customers information systems 
implementation of the new management information system  including the integration with other systems is a very complex process that requires significant financial resources and personnel time  as well as unifying operating policies and procedures to ensure that the total system operates efficiently and effectively 
errors in the implementation could result in additional costs and cause disruptions to our business  which could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
compliance with governmental regulations in multiple jurisdictions where we sell our products is difficult and costly 
in the united states  we are subject to various federal communications commission  or fcc  rules and regulations 
current fcc regulations permit license free operation in certain fcc certified bands in the radio spectrum 
our wireless products are certified for unlicensed operation in the mhz  ghz  ghz and ghz frequency bands  and we expect soon to have certified products in the newly opened ghz band 
operation in these frequency bands is governed by rules set forth in part of the fcc regulations 
the part rules are designed to minimize the probability of interference to other users of the spectrum and  thus  accord part systems unlicensed status in the frequency band 
in the event that there is interference caused by a part user  the fcc can require the part user to curtail transmissions that create interference 
in this regard  if users of our products experience excessive interference from primary users  market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the fcc  however  has established certain standards that create an irrefutable presumption of noninterference for part users and we believe that our products comply with such requirements 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of regulatory changes  including changes in the availability of spectrum  changes in the allowed use spectrum  or modification to the standards establishing an irrefutable presumption for unlicensed part users  would not significantly affect our operations by rendering current products obsolete  restricting the applications and markets served by our products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 

table of contents our products are also subject to regulatory requirements in international markets and  therefore  we must monitor the development of frequency regulations in certain countries that represent potential markets for our products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with regulations in any particular country  we will design our products to minimize the design modifications required to meet various ghz and ghz international spread spectrum regulations 
in addition  we will seek to obtain international certifications for our product line in countries where there are substantial markets for wireless networking systems 
changes in  or the failure by us to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  with respect to those countries that do not follow fcc regulations  we may need to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations 
regulatory changes by the fcc or by regulatory agencies outside the united states  including changes in the availability of spectrum  could significantly affect our operations by restricting our development efforts  rendering current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
several changes by the fcc were approved within the last eight years including changes in the allocation and use of available frequency spectrum  as well as the granting of an interim waiver 
these approved changes could create opportunities for other wireless networking products and services 
there can be no assurance that new regulations will not be promulgated  that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
it is possible that the united states and other jurisdictions will adopt new laws and regulations affecting the pricing  characteristics and quality of broadband wireless systems and products 
increased government regulations could decrease the growth of the broadband wireless industry  hinder our ability to conduct business both domestically and internationally  reduce our revenues  increase the costs and pricing of our products  increase our operating expenses  and expose us to significant liabilities 
any of these events or circumstances could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our operating results have been  and could further be  adversely affected as a result of purchase accounting treatment and the impact of amortization and impairment of intangible assets relating to the merger and the agere asset purchase 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we accounted for our merger with proxim  inc using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have recorded the market value of our common stock issued in connection with the merger  the fair value of the options to purchase proxim  inc common stock that became options to purchase proxim corporation common stock and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of combining with proxim  inc we have allocated the cost of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology and acquired trademarks and trade names and in process research and development  based on their respective fair values at the date of the completion of the merger 
intangible assets are required to be amortized prospectively over their estimated useful lives 
the purchase price was allocated to deferred compensation  based on the portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested proxim  inc options we have assumed to the extent that service is required after completion of the merger in order to vest 
any excess of the purchase price over those fair market values will be accounted for as goodwill 
we are not required to amortize goodwill against income but goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets will be subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
in this regard  due to the decline in forecasted revenue in future periods  we took a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of the impairment charged was measured as the amount that the carrying amount exceeded its 
table of contents estimated fair value 
if we are required to recognize additional impairment charges  the charge will negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 
the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuation  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the trading prices of our common stock have been subject to wide fluctuations  and such trend is likely to continue with respect to the trading price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in revenues and operating results  announcements of innovations and new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors  changes in our expected operating expense levels  changes in financial estimates and recommendations of financial and industry analysts  the operating and securities price performance of comparable companies  and news reports relating to trends in the wireless communications industry 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for wireless related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may influence the trading price of our common stock 
these trading price fluctuations may make it more difficult to use our common stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock options as a means to attract and retain employees 
accordingly  you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  prevent or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or change of control of our company despite the possibility that such transactions may be viewed to be in the best interest of our stockholders since such transactions could result in a higher stock price than the then market price of our common stock 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock with the terms of each series to be fixed by the board of directors  divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year  permit directors to be removed only for cause  and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  with some exceptions  the delaware general corporation law will restrict or delay mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires or more of our voting stock 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to analyze and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules and listing requirements 
devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public 
table of contents disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to these compliance activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
exchange rate risk we currently have operations in the united states and several countries in south america  europe and asia 
the functional currency of all our operations is the us dollar 
though some expenses are incurred in local currencies by our overseas operations  substantially all of our transactions are made in us dollars  hence  we have minimal exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to our transactions 
while we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated predominately in us dollars  an increasing portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the fair value of our investments 
we invested in equity investments in a public company for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
we have also invested in an equity instrument in a private company  which completed its ipo in january this equity investment  in a technology company  is subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
as of february   we had unrealized gain of million which was recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our earnings and cash flows 
there are  however  a number of factors beyond our control 
continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods
