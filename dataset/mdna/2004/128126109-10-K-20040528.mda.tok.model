item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview california amplifier designs  manufactures and markets microwave equipment used in the reception of television programming transmitted from satellites and wireless terrestrial transmission sites  and two way transceivers used for wireless high speed internet broadband service 
the company s satellite business unit designs and markets reception products principally for the direct broadcast satellite dbs subscription television market in the united states  as well as a line of consumer and commercial products for video and data reception 
the wireless access business unit designs and markets integrated reception and two way transmission fixed wireless equipment for broadband data and video applications 
the company s satellite products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar communications corporation and directv group inc  as well as to system integrators and distributors for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
the company sells its wireless access products directly to system operators as well as through distributors and system integrators 
revenue consists principally of sales of outdoor reception equipment for the us satellite television industry  which accounted for over of revenue in the fiscal year ended february  the dbs system operators have approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market grew by from million subscribers to million subscribers 
demand for the company s satellite television reception products are driven not only by the growth in the overall dbs subscriber base  but also by product upgrade cycles and subscriber churn 
churn  which is defined as subscribers whose service is disconnected for any reason  is an important factor driving demand for the company s satellite products because the outdoor reception equipment typically is not redeployed by the service provider when churn occurs 
average monthly churn in the us dbs market was approximately and in calendar years and  respectively 
given the size of the us satellite television market of about million subscribers  this means that in calendar the aggregate churn amounted to approximately million subscribers 
in april the company acquired the satellite dish antenna manufacturing business of kaul tronics 
this acquisition was driven by the strategic goal of becoming a vertically integrated supplier of outdoor customer premise equipment to the dbs industry 
based on information currently available  the company believes that its market share of the outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry is now approximately 
the company believes that the acquisition of kaul tronics has helped increase its share of the overall market  but it has also contributed to downward pressure on gross profit margins in the satellite business segment because the antenna dishes are more of a commodity product and therefore have lower margins than the lnbf portion of the outdoor reception system 
recent increases in the cost of raw steel  which is the primary material for the antenna dishes  is expected to put additional pressure on satellite product gross margins for at least the near term future 
revenue from sale of wireless access products accounted for over of the company s total revenue in fiscal  but this business unit s sales have declined over the past two years such that wireless access products accounted for only about of fiscal revenues 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from one of our key customers in our satellite products business and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  the rate of subscriber churn in the us dbs market  and the ability of the system operators to manage and reduce their churn rates the rate of growth in the overall subscriber base in the us dbs market the economic and market conditions in the wireless communications markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets 
the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  and for these and other reasons  the company s net revenue in fiscal may not necessarily be indicative of future years revenue amounts 
from time to time  the company s key customers significantly reduce their product orders  or may place significantly larger orders  either of which can cause the company s quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
as further discussed under the caption recent developments in item i  on april  the company acquired vytek corporation  a privately held company headquartered in san diego  california engaged in providing hardware and software products and services that enable both wireless and wireline access to video  voice and data 
this acquisition was motivated primarily by the strategic goals of increasing the company s presence in markets which offer higher growth and profit margin potential  and diversifying the company s business and customer base beyond its current dependence on the two us dbs system operators 
material opportunities for the company include increasing our market share for outdoor reception equipment in the us dbs market  expanding our presence in wireless industry market segments for both fixed and mobile wireless applications  and leveraging california amplifier s high volume manufacturing capabilities to gain production contracts with customers of vytek s product design and consulting engineering services 
the company s challenges include managing recent raw steel cost increases  improving product margins  and integrating the recent acquisition of vytek 
basis of presentation the company uses a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to february  which for fiscal years  and fell on february   march  and march   respectively 
in these consolidated financial statements  the fiscal year end for all years is shown as february for clarity of presentation 
fiscal years  and all consisted of weeks 
as described further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in july the company sold its interest in micro pulse  a company engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of antennas and amplifiers used principally in gps applications 
accordingly  the results of operations of micro pulse  which represented a separate business segment of the company  have been presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is quite concentrated  with four customers accounting for approximately of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of sales 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance the deferred income tax asset reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
during fiscal years and  the valuation allowance was reduced by an aggregate amount of  substantially all of which related to tax benefits associated with exercises of non qualified stock options in prior years and was therefore recognized by increasing additional paid in capital 
these reductions of the valuation allowance in fiscal years and exhausted that portion of the valuation allowance that was related to tax benefits from option exercises 
during fiscal  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was further reduced by  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense by a corresponding amount 
at february  the company s net deferred income tax asset was  which amount is net of a valuation allowance of  if in the future a portion or all of the  valuation allowance at february  is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance will decrease the income tax provision 
conversely  if in the future the company were to change its realization probability assessment to less than  the company would provide an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax asset  which would increase the income tax provision 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
and certain sections of accounting principles board opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to address situations where alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the company has adopted this statement  which has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment writedown of  on property and equipment which had become underutilized due to increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers 
the company also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on march  the first day of fiscal 
as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to a transitional impairment analysis and is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated and is usually based on projected cash flows or a market value approach 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
results of operations  fiscal years through the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended february  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative operating income settlement of litigation other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations gain on sale of discontinued operations net income the company s sales and gross profit by business segment for the last three years are as follows sales by segment year ended february  of of of segment s total s total s total satellite    wireless access    total    gross profit by segment year ended february  of of of segment s total s total s total satellite    wireless access    total    the satellite business unit generates its revenue almost entirely from the sale of outdoor reception equipment for use with subscription satellite television programming services 
such products accounted for to of satellite segment revenues in fiscal years  and the remaining revenue of the satellite segment in these fiscal years was generated from the sale of commercial satellite products for video and data reception 
revenue of the wireless access business segment revenue by product type for the last three years is as follows in s fiscal year ended february  wireless television products    broadband wireless access antenna transceivers    total wireless access segment revenue    fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales substantially all of the company s satellite sales consist of outdoor reception equipment for the us direct broadcast satellite dbs industry 
sales of satellite products increased  or  in fiscal from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from substantially higher customer orders in fiscal for the latest generation integrated amplifier downconverter products referred to in the industry as low noise block feeds or lnbfs  which have higher average selling prices compared to earlier generation lnbf products 
also  satellite revenues in the second half of fiscal were depressed because of lower unit sales of lnbf products caused by a delay in obtaining customer acceptance of new product designs that were approved in the latter part of fiscal s third quarter 
a new lnbf product was introduced during fiscal which generated sales of million 
also  the number of units sold in fiscal for all other lnbf products was approximately higher than in fiscal  and the average selling price of these other lnbf products increased by approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal sales of wireless access products in fiscal declined by  or  from fiscal this decline resulted mainly because fiscal s revenue included several large sales that were nonrecurring 
gross profit and gross margins in fiscal  satellite gross profit declined by  or  from fiscal  and gross margin declined to this year from in fiscal despite the fact that satellite sales in fiscal are higher than in fiscal  the quarter to quarter volatility of sales in the fiscal was extreme  ranging from a low of million in the first quarter and a high of million in the third quarter 
this volatility in sales  which caused similar volatility in manufacturing activity  was caused by rapid shifts in demand on the part of the two us dbs service providers 
this required the company to make a rapid contraction in production capability in the first quarter  and a rapid expansion of production capability in the third quarter  all of which adversely affected manufacturing efficiencies and gross margins 
also contributing to the declines in satellite gross profit and gross margin in fiscal was the effect of persistent competitive pricing pressures on certain satellite products and significantly higher freight costs incurred for the procurement of raw materials and subassemblies in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  included in satellite cost of sales for fiscal were asset impairment writedowns of  on property and equipment which had become underutilized due to increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers  and a lower of cost or market inventory writedown of  wireless access gross profit decreased  or  and gross margin for wireless access products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in wireless access gross profit was primarily due to the year over year decrease in sales 
the decline in wireless gross margin in the latest year is also attributable to the decrease in wireless sales  which resulted in higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs that are included in cost of sales 
see also note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses research and development expense decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline in r d expense in fiscal is due in part to the cancellation  in the third quarter of fiscal  of a product development contract for broadband wireless application specific integrated circuits asics because the market timing for large scale deployment of this technology was considered to be uncertain in the near term future 
this cancellation resulted in a reduction of approximately  in outside service expense in fiscal also contributing to the decline in r d expense in fiscal was lower salaries expense due to staffing reductions 
selling expense decreased by  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the fact that bad debts expense for fiscal included a charge of  to write down the carrying amount of an available for sale investment in common stock that had been received in fiscal in satisfaction of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that went through a legal reorganization 
general and administrative expense increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s relocation of its facilities in ventura county  california during the fourth quarter of fiscal expense incurred in connection with this relocation amounted to approximately  non operating expense  net net non operating expense increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase in net non operating expense is primarily attributable to a decline in foreign currency gains from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decline in effective tax rate is attributable primarily to the fact that  in fiscal  reductions in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance had a corresponding impact on the income tax provision 
prior to fiscal  reductions of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance were offset by increases in additional paid in capital  and accordingly the effective income tax rate in fiscal was not impacted by adjustments to the valuation allowance 
see further discussion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the effective income tax rate is expected to revert to a more normal level because the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was substantially eliminated by the end of fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales sales of satellite products increased  or in fiscal from fiscal this increase resulted from the acquisition of the kaul tronics satellite antenna dish business on april   as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the acquired kaul tronics business accounted for approximately million of satellite segment sales during fiscal  substantially all of which consisted of antenna dishes and associated mounting hardware 
partially offsetting the fiscal revenue contribution of the kaul tronics business was a decline in revenue from the sale of lnbfs due to a decline of approximately in units sold 
the average selling price of lnbfs in fiscal was relatively unchanged from fiscal sales of wireless access products in fiscal decreased  or  from fiscal this is the net result of a  decline in sales of broadband wireless access antenna transceivers and a  increase in sales of wireless cable television products 
the decline in broadband wireless transceivers is attributable to a combination of the general slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry and the anticipation of next generation non line of sight broadband wireless products 
the company does not anticipate that its wireless access sales will increase appreciably until the broadband wireless service providers resume the expansion of their subscriber bases 
in response to the substantial decline in its broadband wireless product line  the company s wireless access unit concentrated its sales efforts on foreign wireless cable television system operators  and was able to grow this portion of its wireless business in fiscal despite the fact that the overall wireless cable television market is declining 
gross profit and gross margins satellite gross profit increased  or  while gross margin for satellite products was stable year over year and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
benefiting fiscal gross profit and gross margin were cost reductions on existing satellite products arising from product design changes and negotiated price reductions on raw material components 
however  the positive impact of these cost reductions were largely offset by several negative factors  specifically production inefficiencies caused by delays in receiving materials during and after the west coast dockworkers lockout  lower average selling prices for mature lnbf products  costs associated with production ramp up of new satellite products  raw steel price increases during fiscal  and costs in the aggregate amount of approximately  associated with a satellite product replacement program in the fourth quarter of fiscal since the fourth quarter of fiscal  the price of raw steel  which is a key material for the company s satellite dish antenna products  has increased substantially  which could adversely affect profit margins in fiscal the company is taking steps to minimize the impact of these cost increases by  among other things  passing through these cost increases to customers to the extent possible given competitive market conditions 
wireless access gross profit decreased  or  while gross margin for wireless access products declined to in fiscal from in fiscal these declines are primarily attributable to the decrease in wireless sales and the resultant higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs that are included in cost of sales 
operating expenses research and development expenses decreased by  or  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decline is primarily due to headcount reductions and a reduced level of subcontracted product development expenses of the wireless access business segment in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company cancelled a product development contract for broadband wireless application specific integrated circuits asics because the market timing for large scale deployment of this technology was uncertain in the near term future 
as a result of this cancellation  expense associated with this product development contract was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal selling expenses decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the decrease occurred primarily because fiscal selling expense included the write off of a receivable from a customer of the company s wireless access business unit in the amount of  general and administrative expense decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower accounting and legal expenses of  lower consulting expense of  lower employee recruiting and relocation expenses of  lower goodwill amortization expense of  because beginning in fiscal goodwill is no longer amortized  as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and lower incentive compensation expense of  another factor contributing  to this year to year change is that g a expense for fiscal includes a loss on sale of equipment of  while g a expense for fiscal includes a gain on sale of equipment of  contributing to the year to year declines for accounting  legal and consulting expenses discussed above were the fact that these professional service expenses for fiscal included approximately  associated with the restatement of the company s fiscal and interim fiscal financial statements 
remaining reductions in professional service fees in fiscal compared to fiscal are primarily because fiscal amounts included legal fees in connection with several litigation matters  and because fiscal accounting expense includes audit fees for redundant services due to the company s decision to terminate arthur andersen and to engage kpmg to audit the fiscal financial statements after arthur andersen had already begun its work on that audit 
operating income increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the principal reasons for the improvement are as described above a million decrease in gross profit  offset by a million decrease in operating expenses 
litigation settlement the settlement of litigation expense in the amount of  for fiscal represents an accrued settlement of  for litigation brought against the company as a result of the fiscal and financial misstatements caused by the company s former controller  and an accrual of  for a refund payable to an insurance company involving a legal settlement reached in march income tax provision and deferred income tax asset the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to state income tax rate changes 
the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was established in years prior to fiscal because management believed at the time that it did not have the basis to conclude that it was more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset would be fully realized in the future 
based on profitable operations in the most recent three year period  and on management s internal forecast of future operating results  management believed that it was more likely than not that the company would generate sufficient taxable income subsequent to fiscal to utilize deferred tax assets of  and accordingly the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  during fiscal because that portion of the valuation allowance that was reduced during fiscal was associated with tax deductions on non qualified employee stock options which were exercised in earlier years  the valuation allowance was reduced with a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  which amounted to  at february   and its million working capital line of credit with a bank 
during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased by  this net increase consisted of cash provided by operating activities of  proceeds from sale of property and equipment of  and proceeds from stock option exercises of  less cash used for capital expenditures of  and net repayments of debt of  cash was used by an increase in operating working capital during fiscal in the aggregate amount of  comprised of a  increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in inventories  a  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  and a decrease of  in accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase of  in accounts payable 
the company believes that inflation and foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on its operations in fiscal the company believes that fiscal year will not be impacted significantly by foreign exchange since a significant portion of the company s sales are to us markets  or to international markets where its sales are denominated in us dollars 
at february  the company had a million working capital line of credit with a commercial bank that matures on august  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the bank s prime rate  and are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at february   million was outstanding on this line of credit which is classified as long term at that date 
at february   there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
at february  and  amounts reserved under the line of credit for outstanding irrevocable stand by letters of credit were  and  respectively 
the company also has two term loans with this bank that had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  at february   as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the bank credit agreement that encompasses the working capital line of credit and the two bank term loans contains certain financial covenants and ratios that the company is required to maintain  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than  a current ratio of not less than  a leverage ratio of not more than  tangible net worth of at least  such minimum amount increasing by million annually beginning on march   cash and cash equivalents not less than million  and net income of at least in each fiscal year 
at february  and  the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the bank credit agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause that enables the bank to call the loans in the event of a material adverse change as defined in the company s business 
based on the company s history of profitable operations and positive operating cash flow over the past four years  and based on the company s internal financial forecasts for the next year  the company does not believe it is probable that the bank will assert the material adverse change clause in the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations following is a summary of the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  in thousands future cash payments due by fiscal year contractual there obligations after total debt      operating leases   purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations       purchase obligations consists of obligations under non cancelable purchase orders  primarily for inventory purchases of raw materials  components and subassemblies 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with amounts available under its working capital line of credit  are sufficient to support operations  fund capital equipment requirements and discharge contractual cash obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
at february   the company s term debt and credit facility with its bank are subject to variable interest rates 
the company monitors its debt and interest bearing cash equivalents levels to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
a fluctuation of one percent in interest rates would have an annual impact of approximately  net of tax on the company s consolidated statement of operations
