critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies followed by valley conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of condition and results of operations for the periods indicated 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
valley s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies followed by valley are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valley has identified its policies on the allowance for loan losses and income tax liabilities to be critical because management has to make subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
additional information on these policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of condition 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this md a 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in valley s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

table of contents fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could impact valley s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements include additional discussion on the accounting for income taxes 
executive summary net income was million  or per diluted share in compared with million or per diluted share in net income includes an million tax benefit associated with the restructuring of a valley subsidiary into a reit 
return on average assets for decreased to percent compared with percent in  while the return on average equity increased to percent in compared with percent in although interest rates continued to decline in from  valley s net interest income increased million  contributing to increased earnings per share 
an increase in average loan and investment volume helped to offset the decline in interest rates  as well as decreased interest rates paid on deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
earnings for were also impacted by a lower provision for loan losses  increases in non interest income such as the gains on sales of securities  fee income from valley s acquisitions in and january as well as gains on sales of loans 
these increases were partly offset by prepayment penalties associated with refinancing million of valley s higher cost borrowings  decreased dividends from the federal home loan bank fhlb  reduced interest income from funds used to repurchase valley s common stock and higher salaries and employee benefit expenses 
net interest income net interest income continues to be the largest source of valley s operating income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for compared with million for higher average balances of loans and investments were more than offset by lower average interest rates for these interest earning assets during compared with lower average interest rates on investments were also the result of increased amortization of premiums due to higher levels of prepayments 
also  for  total average interest bearing liabilities increased causing interest expense to increase  but was totally mitigated by declining interest rates associated with these liabilities compared to the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was percent for the twelve months ended december  compared with percent for the same period in the change was mainly attributable to interest rates declining to historic low levels during compressing the net interest margin for valley and the banking industry 
additionally  prepayment penalties associated with refinancing million of valley s higher cost borrowings  decreased dividends from the fhlb and reduced income from funds used to repurchase valley s common stock negatively impacted net interest income 
increased loan and investment volume partially mitigated the negative impact of lower interest rates 
the net interest margin and net interest income were affected by the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin which required valley to de consolidate vnb capital trust i  which issued million of preferred securities 
as a result of this de consolidation  junior subordinated debentures issued by vnb capital trust i are now recorded as long term debt and costs related to these junior subordinated debentures are included in interest expense 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
as a result of the net interest margin compression discussed above  management enacted borrowing and funding strategies in the third and fourth quarters of  which  combined with increased loan and investment volume and a decrease in investment premium amortization provided the catalyst which increased fourth quarter net interest income to million and the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis to percent 
that compares with net interest income of million for the third quarter of with a net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent 
average interest earning assets increased million or percent in over the amount 
this was mainly the result of the increase in average balance of loans of million or percent and the increase in average balance of taxable investments of million or percent 

table of contents average interest bearing liabilities for increased million or percent from average savings deposits increased million or percent and continue to provide a low cost source of funding 
this increase was attributed to the addition of new branches  increased customer activity and relatively new deposit products as well as advertising and promotional efforts 
average time deposits decreased million or percent from  due to valley s strategy to fund with lower cost deposits and borrowings 
the decline in interest rates on deposits caused a net decrease in interest expense on deposits by million 
average short term borrowings increased million or percent over balances 
a portion of this increase was the result of borrowing at a lower cost in advance of other borrowings maturing in the first quarter of average long term debt  which includes fhlb advances  increased million  or percent 
during  valley repositioned some of its borrowings to take advantage of low long term interest rates 
it is anticipated that this strategy will enable valley to better match its lower yielding fixed rate loans should interest rates rise 
average interest rates  in all categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  decreased during compared to the average interest rate for loans decreased basis points to percent and the average interest rate for taxable investments decreased basis points to 
average interest rates on total interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent 
average interest rates also decreased on total interest bearing liabilities by basis points to percent from percent 
average interest rates on deposits decreased by basis points to percent

table of contents non interest income continues to represent a considerable source of income for valley  representing percent and percent of total interest income plus non interest income for and  respectively 
trust and investment services include income from trust operations  brokerage commissions  and asset management fees 
the increase of million in as compared with was primarily due to additional brokerage commissions from the acquisition of glen rauch in january note of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion on acquisitions made by vnb 
insurance premiums increased million or percent in as compared with  due to increased revenue from valley s acquisitions of nia lawyers a title insurance agency and masters an all line insurance agency 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion on acquisitions made by valley 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million or percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  mainly due to increases in account maintenance fees and a higher volume of accounts assessed with service charges 
gains on securities transactions  net  increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  during  sales of equity securities and mortgage backed securities resulted in gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
valley took advantage of the bond market s strength earlier this year providing gains on mortgage backed securities which were paying down rapidly 
many of these mortgage backed securities had substantial unrealized gains  low give up yields and if not sold  had a strong likelihood of paying off at par within a very short time 
management made the decision to sell selected positions to realize these gains and will continue to monitor its inventory for more opportunities as part of its program of providing total returns and active portfolio management 
the gains on mortgage backed securities had the effect of reducing interest income during some portion of  but overall increasing net income 
gains on equity securities represent gains on positions valley may take from time to time in institutions it may be interested in acquiring 
gains on trading securities  net  are realized gains or losses on the sale of trading securities  primarily municipal and corporate bonds which are held by glen rauch securities 
fees from loan servicing include fees for servicing residential mortgage loans and sba loans 
for the year ended december   fees from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled million and fees from servicing sba loans totaled million  as compared to million and million for the year ended december  the aggregate principal balances of mortgage loans serviced by vnb s subsidiary vnb mortgage services  inc msi for others approximated billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
the increase for includes a million purchase of loan servicing rights on a million newly originated low coupon mortgage portfolio 
the continuing heavy refinancing and payoff activity resulted in less fee income during from the serviced mortgage loan portfolio as borrowers took advantage of lower interest rates causing balances to decline 
interest rates decreased in the fourth quarter of and into early unlike the significant increase in application volume and prepayment activity in early  when interest rates were at similar levels  valley has not experienced a corresponding increase in early accordingly  prepayment activity declined in the fourth quarter of which continued into early  suggesting that refinancing activity may have reached a saturation point in valley s market area 
if long term interest rates decrease further during  then the level of prepayment activity may accelerate once again and possibly reduce fee income 
gains on sales of loans  net  increased to million for the year compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in gains was primarily attributed to the sale of million in residential mortgage loans compared with million sold for the same period in valley originated over billion in residential mortgage loans during and chose to sell the majority of the lower rate year fixed rate loans  thereby reducing interest risk on those loans should rates rise in future periods 
valley believes this strategy will help future net income should rates rise 
during  approximately million of gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans and million of gains from the sale of sba loans were recorded by vnb for sale into the secondary market 

table of contents during and  valley invested a total of million in boli to help offset the rising cost of employee benefits 
income of million was recorded from the boli during the year ended december   a decrease of thousand over the prior year as a result of lower yields on boli investments 
boli income is exempt from federal and state income taxes 
the boli is invested in investment securities including mortgage backed  treasuries and high grade corporate securities and is managed by two independent investment firms 
other non interest income decreased million to million in as compared to this decrease was mainly due to a million gain on sale of an office building during the third quarter of  a million gain from the sale of a canadian subsidiary during the second quarter of and a settlement of a lawsuit which resulted in a gain of approximately million recorded during the first quarter of the significant components of other non interest income include fees generated from letters of credit and acceptances  credit cards and safe deposit box rentals totaling approximately million 
non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years ended december   and non interest expense years ended december  in thousands salary expense employee benefit expense net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense amortization of intangible assets advertising merger related charges other total non interest expense non interest expense totaled million for  an increase of million or percent from the largest components of non interest expense were salaries and employee benefit expense which totaled million in compared with million in  an increase of million or percent 
at december   full time equivalent staff was  compared to  at the end of the increases in salary and employee benefit expense were due largely to the recently acquired subsidiaries and business expansion 
the efficiency ratio measures a bank s total non interest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
valley s efficiency ratio for the year ended december  was percent compared to percent for valley s acquisition of fee based subsidiaries has negatively affected the efficiency ratio as these businesses traditionally operate at higher efficiency ratios 
net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense  collectively  increased million or percent during in comparison to this increase can be attributed to the recently acquired subsidiaries  new and refurbished branch locations and an overall increase in the cost of operating bank facilities  mainly  maintenance  depreciation and rent expense 
depreciation expense increased by approximately million during  primarily due to major computer hardware and software purchases and upgrades to better serve valley s customers 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets  consisting primarily of amortization of loan servicing rights increased million or percent to million 
an impairment analysis is completed to determine the appropriateness of the value of valley s mortgage servicing asset 
a total impairment expense of million was recorded during compared with million in as a result of increased refinancing activity and a large volume of prepayments on higher rate mortgages during the first half of the year 
long term interest rates increased during the third quarter of  then decreased during the fourth quarter of and into january this caused a slowdown in prepayment activity 
valley anticipates that the prepayment slowdown that began during the latter part of the year may continue during and correspondingly  amortization expense for loan servicing rights may be lower in future periods 
other non interest expense increased million or percent in compared with the significant components of other non interest expense include data processing  professional fees  postage  telephone  stationery  insurance  title search fees and service fees totaling approximately million for  compared to million for during the first quarter of  valley recorded merger related charges of million related to the acquisition of merchants
