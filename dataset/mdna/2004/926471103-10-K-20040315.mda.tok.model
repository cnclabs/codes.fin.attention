this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the words expects  believes  intends  will  anticipates  and similar expressions or the negatives of these words or phrases are intended to identify forward looking statements 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this document  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview we are a transatlantic biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of seriously ill patients 
since our inception in as a wholly owned subsidiary of sepracor inc  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to establishing our business and conducting research and development activities related to our proprietary product candidates  including anidulafungin and dalbavancin  as well as collaborative product candidates 
since  we have been operating as an independent company 
in august  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an initial public offering  and in september the underwriters exercised an over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares 
we received total net proceeds from the initial public offering and the over allotment of approximately million 
on april   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to selected institutional investors at a purchase price of per share 
we received net proceeds from the private placement of approximately million 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of biosearch italia spa  a publicly listed company in italy 
we have issued shares of our common stock for each outstanding share of biosearch stock  or approximately million shares 
on june   we contributed the former assets  liabilities and business of biosearch to our wholly owned subsidiary in italy  vicuron pharmaceuticals italy sr on july   we sold  shares of common stock at per share in a public offering 
we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s  which we expect either has been or will be declared effective on the date of this filing 
if the sec declares the shelf registration effective  we will be able to offer up to million of our securities from time to time in one or more public offerings of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants and or debt securities 
since we began our operations in  we have not generated any revenues from product sales 
in early  we completed a phase iii clinical trial with anidulafungin  our lead antifungal product candidate  for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis 
based in part on the results of that trial  in april we filed an nda for anidulafungin for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis  which was accepted for review by the fda in june in january  we announced that we received notification from the fda that the agency now anticipates completing its review of our anidulafungin nda on may   which represents a day extension of the original action date 
the extension was triggered by the fda s request for additional bioanalytical data 
we continue to expect the launch of anidulafungin in the first half of as planned  although our plans are dependent on receiving fda approval 
in december  we also announced the filing of our marketing authorization application for anidulafungin for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis with the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea  which will be reviewed under the european community centralized licensing procedure  which is the procedure used to determine the scope of marketing authorization for human therapeutic products in all member states of the european community 
our lead antibiotic product candidate  dalbavancin entered into phase iii clinical trials in december we also completed a phase i clinical trial of vic acne in we also have several lead compounds in pre clinical studies 

table of contents our revenues in the near term are expected to consist primarily of collaborative research payments  license fees and milestone payments to be received from our collaborators 
certain of these payments are dependent on achievement of specified milestones 
if the development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we will generate revenues from sales of these products and from receipt of royalties on sales of these products 
our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred when in licensing existing product candidates  research and development of new product candidates and in connection with our collaboration agreements  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect licensing costs to increase as certain milestones are achieved  and our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
as a result of our merger with biosearch in the first quarter of  we also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to add personnel  integrate our operations and expand our research and development operations 
we expect to incur sales and marketing expenses in the future when we establish our sales and marketing organization 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses  which may increase for the foreseeable future  including at least through december  we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible to ascertain 
major research and development projects our ongoing clinical trials of anidulafungin and dalbavancin are our two most significant research and development projects  generating and  respectively  of our total research and development expenses since our inception 
anidulafungin anidulafungin is our lead antifungal product candidate 
we in licensed anidulafungin from eli lilly pursuant to the may agreement described below 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis 
as of december   the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin is in a phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of invasive candidiasis candidemia  and phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of aspergillosis  patient enrollment completed 
in may  we obtained from eli lilly an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of anidulafungin 
we paid million for the license and an additional million for product inventory which we have received 
as a result  we recognized million of research and development costs in if specified milestones are achieved on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin in the united states and canada  we will be obligated to make additional payments of up to million to eli lilly 
we are also obligated to make additional payments of up to million to eli lilly if specified milestones on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin are achieved in europe  and additional payments of up to million if specified milestones on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin are achieved in japan 
we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if sales of an intravenous formulation of anidulafungin exceed specified targets in the united states and canada  europe and japan 
in addition  we are obligated to make royalty payments in respect of sales of any product resulting from the compound 
we also made a million milestone payment to eli lilly in  which was triggered by our filing of the nda with the fda 

table of contents we are not currently developing an oral formulation of anidulafungin and do not presently intend to do so in the future 
however  under the license agreement with eli lilly  we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if  and only if  specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in the united states  additional payments of up to million if specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in europe  and additional payments of up to million if specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in japan 
in addition  we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if  and only if  sales of an oral formulation of anidulafungin exceed specified targets worldwide 
because an oral formulation of anidulafungin is not currently feasible  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be obligated to make any of these payments to eli lilly 
we have also granted to eli lilly an option to license the exclusive worldwide rights to any oral formulation of anidulafungin  which is exercisable upon successful completion of phase ii clinical trials 
if eli lilly exercises this option  eli lilly would pay us an up front fee and royalties based on net product sales  and would reimburse us for any milestone payments paid plus the value  on a cost plus basis  of all prior development expenses attributed to the development and commercialization of the oral formulation of anidulafungin 
however  due to the speculative nature of the oral formulation of anidulafungin  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be entitled to receive fees or royalties and reimbursement of expenses from eli lilly 
research and development expense allocated to our anidulafungin project  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period  was for the year compare to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for the each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our anidulafungin project is to obtain marketing approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
material cash inflows relating to our anidulafungin project will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if anidulafungin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of anidulafungin 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our anidulafungin project will commence  if ever 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for anidulafungin would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity because our research and development projects are independent  a failure to obtain marketing approval for anidulafungin would not necessarily interrupt our development programs for dalbavancin or our pre clinical compounds  however  we might reduce our development staff unless one or more of our other product candidates is then entering in late stage clinical trials  in which case we might re assign anidulafungin researchers to those projects  we would be relieved of our contingent obligation to make further milestone payments and royalty payments to eli lilly  we would not earn any sales revenue from anidulafungin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 

table of contents dalbavancin dalbavancin is our lead antibiotic product candidate 
we in licensed dalbavancin from biosearch pursuant to the february agreement described below 
as of december   dalbavancin is in three phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections  and a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of catheter related blood stream infections  which was completed and topline data released in january in february  we entered into a license agreement and a collaborative agreement with biosearch 
under the license agreement  biosearch granted us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize dalbavancin in the united states and canada 
in exchange for the license and upon the receipt of favorable results in pre clinical studies  we paid an initial license fee of million and issued  shares of our common stock to biosearch 
in may and december  we paid biosearch additional milestone payments for the start of phase ii and phase iii clinical trials  respectively 
as a result of the biosearch merger  we no longer owe any milestones or royalties on dalbavancin 
research and development expense allocated to our dalbavancin project  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period  was for the year compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our dalbavancin project is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
before we can obtain such marketing approvals we will need to complete pivotal phase iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit an nda to the fda 
in any case  we would not expect to file an nda for dalbavancin until the second half of  at the earliest 
we are unable to estimate the costs to completion for our dalbavancin project due to the risks surrounding the clinical trial process  including the risk that we may repeat  revise or expand the scope of our ongoing clinical trials or conduct additional clinical trials to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks listed under the caption risk factors risks related to our business if clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines  which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
material cash inflows relating to our dalbavancin project will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if dalbavancin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our anidulafungin project will commence  if ever 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for dalbavancin would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity because our research and development projects are independent  a failure to obtain marketing approval for dalbavancin would not necessarily interrupt our development programs for anidulafungin or our pre clinical compounds  however  we might reduce our development staff unless one or more of our other product candidates is then entering in late stage clinical trials  in which case we might be able to re assign dalbavancin researchers to those projects  we would not earn any sales revenue from dalbavancin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and 
table of contents our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
risks relating to our major research and development projects we face many risks that could prevent or delay the completion of our anidulafungin and dalbavancin projects  including those listed under the caption risk factors risks related to operating in our industry 
development administration research and development expense comprising development administration overhead costs  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  we do not allocate our development administration costs among our various projects because our development administration group is managed as a separate cost center and its expenditures are not always project specific 
other research and development projects the remaining of our total research and development expenses from our inception through december  were generated by various pre clinical studies and drug discovery programs  including our collaborations with pfizer and novartis described below 
oxazolidinones collaboration with pfizer 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with pharmacia corporation  now pfizer  pursuant to which we are collaborating to discover  synthesize and develop second and third generation oxazolidinone product candidates 
in connection with the collaboration  pfizer made an equity investment in us of million and paid us research support and license fee payments 
under the terms of the agreement and in consideration of our research obligations  we are entitled to receive funding from pfizer to support certain of our full time researchers 
if specified milestones are achieved  pfizer is obligated to pay us additional payments of up to million for each compound  a portion of which may be credited against future royalty payments to which we are entitled on the worldwide sales of any drug developed and commercialized from the collaboration 
in october  pfizer increased its funding for this collaboration by  and in june  we received a milestone payment for the initiation of clinical development of one of the compounds 
in july  we agreed with pfizer by amendment to extend the collaboration for an additional three years through march through december   pfizer has made aggregate payments to us under this collaboration agreement excluding equity investments of million 
in  the company received million in payments and recognized million in revenue 
research and development expense allocated to our collaboration with pfizer  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from january  through december  the goal of our collaboration with pfizer is to discover  synthesize and obtain marketing approval for second and third generation oxazolidinone product candidates 
we supply research  product leads and other specified intellectual property to the collaboration 
the collaboration also depends upon pfizer to develop the product candidates  to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies and to 
table of contents manufacture and sell any products resulting from the collaboration 
material cash inflows in the form of royalties relating to this collaboration will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
one product candidate resulting from the collaboration has entered phase i clinical trials 
in order to obtain marketing approval  pfizer will need to complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit an nda to the fda 
pfizer is under no obligation to continue the development of any product candidate resulting from this collaboration 
because of this  and the substantial risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our collaboration with pfizer will commence  if ever 
in may  we announced an agreement to continue this collaboration 
deformylase inhibitors collaboration with novartis 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis pharma ag pursuant to which we are collaborating to discover and develop novel deformylase inhibitors 
in connection with the collaboration  novartis made an initial equity investment in us of million 
we have also received a number of milestone payments from novartis and are entitled to receive additional payments of up to million for our compounds or up to million for novartis compounds upon the achievement of specified milestones 
novartis may deduct a portion of these milestone payments from the royalties it will be obligated to pay us on the worldwide sales of any drug developed and commercialized from this collaboration 
in february  we amended the original agreement in order to extend the research term through march  in september  we announced achievement of a late stage pre clinical milestone for which we received a milestone payment from novartis  and in december we announced that we received an additional milestone payment from novartis as a result of entering into phase i work on our research collaboration with novartis 
through december   novartis has made aggregate payments to us under this agreement excluding equity investments of million 
in  the company received million of which million was recognized as revenue 
research and development expense allocated to our collaboration with novartis  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from january  through december  the goal of our collaboration with novartis is to discover  synthesize and obtain marketing approval for deformylase inhibitor product candidates 
we are responsible for supplying research to the collaboration  according to a research plan developed by a joint research committee 
our research obligations currently extend through march novartis provides us with funding to support some of our researchers on this project 
the collaboration will depend upon novartis to conduct the development of product candidates and to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies 
material cash inflows in the form of royalties relating to this collaboration will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
currently one compound identified by the collaboration is in phase i clinical trials 
in order to obtain marketing approval  novartis will need to initiate and complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit an nda to the fda 
novartis is under no obligation to continue the development of any product candidate resulting from this collaboration 
because of this  and the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our collaboration with novartis will commence  if ever 
in addition to the work on deformylase inhibitors  under the collaboration agreement we have been delivering to novartis a series of screening assays based on novel anti bacterial targets 
for each screen that novartis accepts as validated  we receive a milestone payment 
in august and january  novartis paid us our fourth and fifth milestone payment  respectively  as a result of our delivery of our fourth and fifth target based screens  which we expect will be used in novartis high throughput screening laboratory to identify new anti infectives 

table of contents a failure by pfizer or novartis to pursue or obtain marketing approval for any product candidate resulting from our collaborations could have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not receive any further milestone payments or any royalty revenue from the collaborations  and while we do not rely on any particular external development collaboration to produce marketable products and  ultimately  royalty revenues  the failure of all of our external development collaborations would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our internal research and development efforts 
deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
we recorded deferred stock compensation net of cancellations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenues consisted of million  million and million of collaborative research and development  contract services and licensing fees from pfizer in  and  respectively  and million  million and million of collaborative research and development fees and milestone payments from novartis in  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in is due to the achievement of additional milestones in the novartis collaboration and recognition of biosearch italia grant revenues 
the slight decrease in revenues in is due to a decrease in revenue from the pfizer upfront license and contract research fees that were recognized as revenue over the initial three year contract term through march  the increase in revenues in was due to the increase in collaborative research and development funding from both pfizer and novartis 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  as well as the costs of consultants  parts and supplies and clinical trials associated with research and development projects 
the increase in research and development expenditure in were due to increased spending on clinical trials associated with dalbavancin and our merger with biosearch italia 
the increase in research and development expenditure in both and is primarily due to the increase in clinical expenditure for the development of our product candidates 
our lead product candidate  anidulafungin  moved into phase iii clinical 
table of contents trials in the first half of and our second product candidate  dalbavancin  moved into phase ii clinical trials in the second quarter of and phase iii clinical trials in december we have also increased the size of our development administration team from one person in february to at december  in addition  we have expanded our collaborative and internal research programs 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel  as well as the costs of facilities  insurance and legal fees 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for was due to our merger with biosearch italia and costs incurred to develop a marketing infrastructure 
our general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in primarily due to a reduction in business development activity from interest income was  and million in  and  respectively 
interest income consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income for is due to additional interest earning assets acquired in our merger with biosearch italia combined with the proceeds of our july stock offering 
the decrease in interest income in and was due to a reduction in interest rates during these two years 
interest expense was  and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense consists of interest on the company s short term and long term debt 
the increase in interest expense was due to the additional debt acquired in our merger with biosearch italia 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to the decrease in related debt 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  and million  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we also have federal and state research credit carryforwards of million and million 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change in ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations principally with the proceeds of million from a series of six preferred stock offerings over the period through  and net proceeds of million from our initial public offering received in august and september in addition  on april   we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock to selected institutional investors at a purchase price of per share  from which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
on july   we sold  shares of common stock at per share in a public offering 
we received net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have also received approximately million in payments for collaborative research  contract services and milestone payments  as well as license fees from our collaborators  including sepracor 
of these payments  million constitutes deferred revenue as of december  we have also increased our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as a result of our merger with biosearch 

table of contents in addition  in february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s  which we expect either has been or will be declared effective on the date of this filing 
if the sec declares the shelf registration statement effective  we will be able to offer up to million of our securities from time to time in one or more public offerings of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants and or debt securities 
in addition  we have a million term loan and million equipment note with a commercial bank 
the term loan accrues interest at the prime rate plus the prime rate was at december  and the equipment note s interest rate is based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin the applicable libor rate for our note was at december  
the terms of the term loan were revised in january and the balance at that time of million became now repayable in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on march  with the final payment due on december  the final note balance is also payable on december  also  in january the term loan was amended to include a three year equipment note for million that we are able to draw down on through december  the note bears interest at the prime rate unless we exercise an option to have the interest on all or any portion of the principal amount based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the interest on the note is payable in quarterly installments during the draw down period 
the principal of the note is payable in equal installments beginning on march  with the final payment due on december  as of december  and  there was an outstanding loan balance of million and million  respectively 
years ended december   and cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the net loss of million for includes a non cash charges for the write off of acquired in process research and development of million and the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million 
the net loss of million for was offset by non cash charges for the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million less an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the net loss of million for was partially offset by non cash charges for the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
in both and  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is a direct result of the increase in our operating costs principally relating to the increase in clinical trial expenditure for the development of our product candidates 
in  the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily relates to prepaid acquisition costs relating to the merger of biosearch with and into versicor 
the decrease in non cash stock compensation in and is due to the fact that the majority of the compensation relates to options issued prior to our initial public offering in august and is being amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
investing activities provided million of cash and used million and million of cash during  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided was due to the sale and maturity of investment securities 
in  the net change in marketable securities was million as proceeds from our private placement in april funded the majority of our operating loss for the year 
in  cash was primarily used for the net purchases of marketable securities of million due to a change in investment portfolio managers 
capital expenditure was million   and million  and  respectively 
higher capital expenditure in related to the construction of our manufacturing facility in italy 
the company estimates that the facility will require million to complete construction during the period from january  to june  higher capital expenditure in related to leasehold improvements at our california facility 
financing activities provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
in  our principal source of cash resulted from the net proceeds of million received from the sale of  shares of stock in a public offering 
in  our principal source of cash resulted from net 
table of contents proceeds of million received from the private placement of  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in april repayments on our term loans increased in due to the equipment note that we entered into in the second half of in  the draw down on our equipment loan of million was partially offset by repayments of our term loan of  we expect to have negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development  and general and administrative expenses  including expenses relating to clinical development  additions to personnel  production and commercialization efforts and the integration of our operations with those of biosearch 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing markets for our products  payments received or made under collaboration agreements  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new products or compounds  the status of competitive products and the availability of other financing 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents  trading securities and available for sale securities acquired in the merger  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt repayments and capital requirements for at least months 
financial condition assets at december  our total assets were approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the reason for this increase is a result of the merger with biosearch italia 
liabilities at december  our total liabilities were approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the reason for this increase is a result of the merger with biosearch italia 
contractual obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total stockholders equity stockholders equity at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the reason for this increase is attributed to common stock issued in connection with the merger with biosearch italia and the issuance of  shares of common stock in a public offering 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not maintained any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities

actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues as they are earned 
revenue from license fees and contract services are recognized over the initial license or contract service term as the related work is performed  which generally is on a straight line basis 
nonrefundable milestone payments received are recognized when they are earned  which is when the specific events which coincide with the achievement of substantive elements in the related collaboration agreements are achieved 
milestone payments received that are creditable against future royalty payments are deferred and recognized as revenue when the royalties are earned or when the payment is no longer creditable against future payments 
collaborative research and development payments are recognized as the related work is performed 
valuation allowance we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
in process research and development in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to operations of million for acquired in process research and development resulting from our merger with biosearch 
this amount represents the estimated fair value relating to incomplete research and development projects  which  at the time of the merger  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
intangible assets the identifiable intangible assets arising from the merger  after allocation of negative goodwill  total million as of december  these intangibles represent patents and core technology  a library of microbial extracts and a bioinformatics software platform 
these identifiable intangible assets have estimated useful lives of between two and thirteen years 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company or an investment in any of our securities 
our actual future results and trends might differ materially from our historical results or trends to date  or those anticipated in our forward looking statements  depending on a variety of factors  including the factors set forth in this section 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial might also harm our business 
risks related to our business our ability to become profitable is heavily dependent upon our obtaining fda approval of anidulafungin and dalbavancin  our two lead product candidates  and marketing them successfully 
in order to become profitable  we anticipate that we will need to obtain fda marketing approval for anidulafungin and dalbavancin and then commercialize them successfully 
in april  we filed an nda with the fda seeking approval to market anidulafungin for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis 
in january  we announced that we received notification from the fda that the agency now anticipates completing its review of our anidulafungin nda on may   which represents a day extension of the original action date 
the extension was triggered by the agency s request for additional pharmacokinetic data 
according to pdufa prescription drug user fee act  the fda can reset the action date to review any additional data 
we continue to expect the launch of anidulafungin in the first half of as planned  although our plans are dependent on receiving fda approval  which may be delayed or denied 
in addition  our product candidate  dalbavancin  is in three phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections and we recently completed a phase ii trial for catheter related bloodstream infections 
we expect to complete the phase iii trials in the first half of and file an nda for dalbavancin in the second half of factors that could negatively affect or delay our receipt of fda approval of one or both of these drugs include a refusal by the fda to approve our ndas for these drugs or a request for additional information or data  delays in completing clinical trials for dalbavancin  and negative or inconclusive results of our ongoing clinical trials of dalbavancin 
our success is also dependent upon successful commercialization of these two product candidates 
successful commercialization requires acceptance of anidulafungin and dalbavancin by hospital based physicians  patients and other medical decision makers 
our success will further depend upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and products 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret and regulatory protections to protect us from competitors with similar technologies 
with regard to anidulafungin  we rely on patents covering the compound  methods of production and methods of use to protect this product candidate from generic competition 
with regard to dalbavancin  we rely primarily on regulatory provisions  such as the data exclusivity provisions under the hatch waxman act  as well as patents and know how to protect this product candidate from generic competition 
however  in each case there can be no assurances that we will obtain protection for any specified duration 
if we are unable to develop and successfully commercialize our product candidates  we might not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
to date  we have not commercialized any products or recognized any revenue from product sales and none of our product candidates are approved for sale 
successful commercialization of a new drug product requires significant investment in research and development  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  regulatory approval  
table of contents and sales and marketing activities 
most of our product candidates are in early stages of development  one is being reviewed by the fda  and three are in clinical trials 
our efforts to commercialize our product candidates are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the development of biopharmaceutical products based on new technologies 
these risks include the following pre clinical testing and clinical trials are protracted  expensive and uncertain processes 
it might take us and our collaborators several years to complete the testing process  and failure can occur at any stage of the process 
success in pre clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful 
any or all of our new drug marketing applications might be denied by the fda and analogous foreign regulators 
our product candidates  even if found to be safe and effective  might be difficult to develop into commercially viable drugs or to manufacture on a large scale or might be uneconomical to market commercially 
third party proprietary rights might preclude us from marketing our drugs 
third parties might market superior drugs or be more effective in marketing equivalent drugs 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and effectively marketed  the size of their potential market might change such that our sales revenue is less than initially contemplated 
in any such case  we might never generate sufficient or sustainable revenues to enable us to become profitable 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and might never achieve profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  including the million write off of acquired in process research and development resulting from our merger with biosearch 
our accumulated deficit results from our net losses of million in  million in  million in including million in accretion of dividends on preferred stock  million in including million in accretion of dividends on preferred stock  million in including deemed dividends of million and million in accretion of dividends on preferred stock  million in including million in accretion of dividends on preferred stock  million in  million in  and million in the year ended december  including a million write off of acquired in process research and development resulting from our merger with biosearch 
our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs relating to the in licensing and development of our product candidates  which represented approximately of our aggregate operating expenses from our inception through december  write off of in process research and development expenses relating to our merger with biosearch  which represented approximately of our aggregate operating expenses from our inception through december   and general and administrative costs relating to our operations  which represented approximately of our aggregate operating expenses from our inception through december  on february   we merged with biosearch  which also incurred net losses since its inception in biosearch s net losses were million for  million for  million for and million from january  through the merger date of february  at february   biosearch had an accumulated deficit of million 
biosearch s losses resulted principally from research and development costs relating to the discovery  development and manufacture of biosearch s product candidates  representing of biosearch s aggregate operating expenses from january  through february   and 
table of contents general and administrative costs relating to biosearch s operations  representing of biosearch s aggregate operating expenses from january  through february  however  these expenses were partially offset by amortization of negative goodwill  less losses on trading securities in the net amount of of biosearch s aggregate operating expenses from january  through february  we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future as a result of increases in our research and development costs  including costs associated with conducting pre clinical testing and clinical trials  and charges related to purchases of technology and other assets 
we expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of receipt of regulatory approval of anidulafungin and our other product candidates  the success of our commercialization efforts following regulatory approval  increases or decreases in our research and development efforts  the execution or termination of collaborative arrangements  the initiation  success or failure of clinical trials  or other factors 
our prospects of achieving profitability will depend on numerous factors  including success in receiving regulatory approvals for our product candidates  developing and testing new product candidates  licensing rights to our product candidates to third parties  qualifying for and receiving grants and subsidies  manufacturing products  marketing products  and competing with products from other companies 
many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will become profitable 
if we do not compete successfully in the development and commercialization of products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to capture and sustain a meaningful market position 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies for treatment 
our competitors in the united states and elsewhere are numerous and include  among others  major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology companies and universities  and other research institutions 
specifically if anidulafungin receives fda and international marketing approval  it will face competition from commercially available drugs such as anaphotericin b  fluconazole  itraconazole  and potentially from caspofungin  which was the first to receive fda approval of a new class of antifungal agents called echinocandins which includes anidulafungin 
one of our competitors initially obtained approval only for the narrow indication of aspergillosis salvage therapy  but has recently expanded its scope to include other serious fungal infections  if dalbavancin receives fda and international marketing approval  it will face competition from commercially available drugs such as vancomycin  teicoplanin  linezolid  quinupristin dalfopristin and daptomycin  and if ramoplanin receives fda and international marketing approval  it will face competition from commercially available drugs such as metronidazole oral vancomycin as well as drugs focused on the treatment as opposed to prevention of bloodstream vancomycin resistant enterocci infections in hospitalized patients  such as linezolid  quinupristin dalfopristin and daptomycin 

table of contents our future products  if any  might also compete with new products currently under development or developed by others in the future 
many of our potential competitors  either alone or together with their collaborators  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development and marketing teams than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing  manufacturing and marketing products 
as a result  these competitors products might come to market sooner or might prove to be more effective  to be less expensive  to have fewer side effects or to be easier to administer than ours 
in any such case  sales of our eventual products would likely suffer and we might never recoup the significant investments we are making to develop these product candidates 
if clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines  which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products we might develop  we must demonstrate through pre clinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans 
conducting pre clinical testing and clinical trials is a protracted  time consuming and expensive process 
completion of clinical trials might take several years or more 
our commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials might be delayed by many factors  including slower than expected rate of hospital and patient recruitment  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the study drug for use in clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  lack of efficiency during the clinical trials  inability to adequately follow patients after treatment  governmental or regulatory delays  and or a decision to expand clinical trials or add studies to increase the statistical significance of the results 
in addition  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials are often not predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
in general  a number of new drugs have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which might delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  regulatory delays or rejections might be encountered as a result of many factors  including perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
as of december   we have one product candidate  anidulafungin  being reviewed by the fda and three product candidates in clinical trials dalbavancin in phase iii  ramoplanin in phase iii  and vic acne which has completed phase i 
we also have anidulafungin in phase iii for an additional indication and dalbavancin and ramoplanin in phase ii each for an additional indication  the dalbavancin phase ii has concluded and top line data released 
patient follow up for these clinical trials has been limited and more trials will be required before we will expect to apply for regulatory approvals 
clinical trials conducted by us or by third parties on our behalf might not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for anidulafungin  dalbavancin  ramoplanin or vic acne or any other potential product candidates 
such a failure might delay development of our other product candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
it might also cause regulatory authorities to prohibit us from undertaking any additional clinical trials for our other product candidates 
our other product candidates are in pre clinical development  and we have not submitted investigational new drug applications  or inds  to commence clinical trials involving these compounds 
our pre clinical development 
table of contents efforts might not be successfully completed and we might not file further inds 
any delays in  or termination of  our clinical trials would harm our development and commercialization timelines  which could cause our stock price to decline 
any of these events could also impede our ability to obtain additional financing 
if our third party clinical trial managers do not perform  clinical trials for our product candidates might be delayed or unsuccessful 
as of december   we had full time clinical development employees 
we expect to continue to rely on third parties  including our collaborators  clinical research organizations and outside consultants  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily under the terms of our agreements with them  clinical trials for our product candidates might be delayed or unsuccessful 
furthermore  the fda and or other regulatory agencies of the eu  might inspect some of our clinical investigational sites  our collaborators records and our facilities and files to determine if the clinical trials were conducted according to good clinical practices 
if the fda determines that our clinical trials were not in compliance with applicable requirements  we might be required to repeat the clinical trials 
if our third party manufacturers do not produce our product candidates on a timely basis  clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed 
we currently do not have manufacturing facilities capable of manufacturing products in quantities necessary for large scale trials or marketing 
the aventis plant in brindisi  italy  and the chemsyn laboratories plant in the united states will be our initial manufacturing sites for dalbavancin and anidulafungin  respectively 
subsequently  we intend to manufacture products in our own manufacturing plant in pisticci  italy  which is currently under construction 
to the extent that our manufacturing capabilities are insufficient to produce all of the necessary active ingredients for our current and future product candidates  we anticipate that we might need to rely on third parties to manufacture some or all of these active ingredients 
however  there are a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced  and third party manufacturers have limited experience in manufacturing anidulafungin  dalbavancin  ramoplanin and vic acne in quantities sufficient for conducting clinical trials or for commercialization 
difficulties are often encountered in manufacturing new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  shortage of qualified personnel  compliance with fda and other regulations  production costs  and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
any contract manufacturer might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time we require to successfully develop  produce and market our product candidates 
if any of our contract manufacturers fails to perform satisfactorily under its agreements with us  such as by failing to deliver the required quantities of our product candidates for clinical use on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  and if we do not find a replacement manufacturer or develop our own manufacturing capabilities  clinical trials involving our product candidates  or commercialization of our products  could be delayed 
if we do not establish successful marketing and sales capabilities or do not enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties  we will not be able to commercialize our future products and will not become profitable 
we intend to sell a portion of our future products  including anidulafungin and dalbavancin  through our own sales force 
at present  however  we are in the process of developing a sales and marketing infrastructure and we lack any experience in direct marketing  sales and distribution 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to develop a direct sales and marketing force to sell our future products  if any  to our target market 
we might not be able to attract and retain qualified salespeople or be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies  our revenues will depend on the efforts of others 
these efforts might not be successful 
if we are unable to enter into third party arrangements  then we must substantially expand our marketing and sales force in order to achieve commercial success for certain products  and to compete with other companies that have experienced and well funded marketing and sales operations 

table of contents if we cannot enter into new in licensing arrangements  our product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed 
an important component of our business strategy is to in license drug compounds discovered by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories  in order to develop them ourselves 
currently we in license anidulafungin from eli lilly 
anidulafungin is our lead antifungal product candidate and one of our four product candidates in clinical development 
under our license arrangement with eli lilly  we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to anidulafungin 
this license arrangement will terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of the expiration of all product patents in the country or years from the date of the first commercial sale of anidulafungin in the country 
competition for new promising compounds can be intense 
if we are not able to identify future in licensing opportunities and enter into future licensing arrangements on acceptable terms  our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed 
if we do not establish and maintain collaborations or if our collaborators do not perform  we will be unable to develop our joint product candidates 
we have entered into collaboration arrangements with third parties to develop product candidates 
additional collaborations might be necessary in order for us to fund our research and development activities and third party manufacturing arrangements  to seek and obtain regulatory approvals and to successfully commercialize our existing and future product candidates 
if we do not maintain our existing collaborative arrangements or do not enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the number of product candidates from which we could receive future revenues would decline 
in addition  our dependence on collaborative arrangements with third parties subjects us to a number of risks  including the following the collaborative arrangements might not be on terms favorable to us 
agreements with collaborators typically allow the collaborators significant discretion in electing whether to pursue any of the planned activities 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborators devote to the product candidates or their prioritization of the product candidates  and our collaborators might choose to pursue alternative products 
our collaborators might also not perform their obligations as expected 
business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator s business strategy might adversely affect a collaborator s willingness or ability to complete its obligations to us 
moreover  we could become involved in disputes with our collaborators which could lead to delays in  or the termination of  our development programs with them  as well as time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
even if we fulfill our obligations under any collaborative agreement  our collaborators can generally terminate the agreements under specified circumstances 
if any collaborator were to terminate or breach their collaborative agreement with us  or otherwise fail to complete its obligations in a timely manner  our chances of successfully commercializing products could be harmed 
if our future products are not accepted by the market  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market products in the future  we might not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we might develop will depend on a number of factors  including demonstrations of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness  potential advantages over alternative therapies  including fewer side effects or easier administration  
table of contents reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities 
physicians will not recommend therapies using any of our future products until clinical data or other factors demonstrate their safety and efficacy as compared to other drugs or treatments 
even if the clinical safety and efficacy of therapies using any of our future products is established  physicians might elect not to recommend the therapies for a number of other reasons  including the possibility that the mode of administration of our future product might not be effective for their patients indications and locations 
for example  many antibiotic or antifungal products are typically administered by infusion or injection  which requires substantial cost and inconvenience to patients and might not be practical in non hospital settings 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community might not accept and utilize any product candidates that we or our collaborators develop 
if none of our future products achieve significant market acceptance  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees and consultants  we will be unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we are highly dependent on our skilled management and scientific staff 
in order to pursue our product development  marketing and commercialization plans  we might need to hire additional personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and finance 
we might not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among high technology enterprises  including biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
most of our management and scientific staff do not have employment contracts 
if we lose a significant number of these persons  or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations might be harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
in addition  we rely on consultants and members of our scientific and clinical advisory boards to assist us in formulating research and development strategies 
all of these consultants and the members of our scientific and clinical advisory boards are employed by others  and they might have commitments to  or advisory or consulting agreements with  others that might limit their availability to us 
if we lose the services of these advisors  our achievement of our development objectives might be impeded  and our business  financial condition and results of operations might be harmed 
finally  except for work performed specifically for and at our direction  the inventions or processes discovered by our scientific and clinical advisory board members and other consultants will not become our intellectual property  but will be the intellectual property of the individuals or their institutions 
if we desire access to these inventions  we will be required to obtain appropriate licenses from the owners 
we face the risk that we might not be able to obtain such licenses on favorable terms or at all 
our revenues are subject to significant fluctuations  which makes it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons from period to period changes in our operating results 
we expect that substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future will result from payments under collaborative arrangements  with some european grant and subsidy revenue 
to date  collaborative payments have taken the form of up front payments  reimbursement for research and development expenses and milestone payments 
milestone payments to us under collaborative arrangements are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount 
as a result  comparisons of our revenues and results of operations between periods might not produce meaningful indications of our progress toward commercializing one or more product candidates 
moreover  the historical revenues of vicuron and biosearch on a stand alone basis might not be indicative of our future performance or of our ability to continue to achieve additional milestones and to receive additional milestone payments from our collaborators 

table of contents we might seek additional funding  which could dilute our stockholders interests in our company or impose burdensome financial restrictions  and if we do not obtain necessary funding  we might be forced to delay or curtail the development of our product candidates 
we expect to incur increasing research and development  general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses over the next several years 
based on our current plans and assumptions  we estimate that our cash and liquid assets at december  will be sufficient to fund our operating losses for the next to months 
however  if our plans change and or our assumptions are inaccurate  we might need to seek and obtain capital sooner than anticipated 
some of our more significant plans and assumptions relate to receipt of regulatory approval for anidulafungin and commencement of a marketing campaign for anidulafungin  payments received or made under possible future collaborative agreements  continued progress in the research and development of our future products  costs associated with protecting our patent and other intellectual property rights  costs associated with developing marketing and sales capabilities  and the rate of market acceptance of any future products 
other than with respect to our million line of credit for equipment financing that we entered into in january and our italian loan facility for the construction of our manufacturing plant  we have no committed sources of additional capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our product candidates 
we might also seek additional funding much earlier than we would otherwise need  in order to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the capital markets 
we might seek to raise funds from a traditional lender or through public or private debt or equity offerings 
to the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the securities could be sold at a discount to prevailing market price and the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  the incurrence of debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and we might be subject to restrictive covenants as a result of such debt financing 
this could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available from any of those sources  our business might be harmed 
we might be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or otherwise significantly curtail operations 
in addition  we might be required to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborators on unattractive terms or relinquish rights to certain technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish in order to continue independent operations 
if we make any more strategic acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and might never realize the anticipated benefits 
we merged with biosearch in and  if appropriate opportunities become available  we might attempt to acquire additional products  product candidates or businesses that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
currently  however  we are not a party to any acquisition agreements 
if we pursue any transaction of that sort  the process of negotiating the acquisition and integrating an acquired product  product candidate or business might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business  whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated 
moreover  we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or impairment expenses related to goodwill and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets  which could harm our financial condition 

table of contents if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant financial loss 
our operations include the controlled use of hazardous materials  primarily small quantities of toxic biological materials and chemical compounds which we store  collect  combine  analyze and  at times  produce in connection with our research and manufacturing activities 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we might be held liable for any resulting damages 
we do not currently maintain separate insurance to cover contamination or injuries relating to hazardous materials  and such liabilities might not be covered by our general liability insurance coverage 
when nasdaq s recently approved director independence rules become effective  compliance with both the new rules and our bylaws  as amended by the merger agreement  might require us to increase the size of our board 
we have eight directors on our board 
in connection with the merger with biosearch  we amended our bylaws in a manner that is intended  among other things  to maintain an even balance of legacy versicor directors and legacy biosearch directors on the board for three years from the date of the completion of the merger 
if we decide to add additional directors to the board during that three year period  our bylaws effectively require us to add an even number of directors with one half of the additional directors proposed by the four legacy versicor directors and the other half proposed by the four legacy biosearch directors in order to maintain an equal number of legacy versicor and biosearch directors on the board 
our bylaws might make it more difficult for us to comply with nasdaq s recently approved director independence rules 
in order for a majority of our directors to be independent  we would need to a ask up to three of our non independent directors to resign followed by appointment of three new independent directors and or b increase the size of our board by adding up to six additional independent directors 
under the recently approved rules  our board will also need to appoint an independent director as chairman of the audit committee 
any increase in the size of our board or change in its membership might give rise to inefficiencies  which might cause some board actions to be delayed 
we will need to comply with the new rules on the earlier of or before the date of our annual stockholders meeting in or october  we might be required to repay some or all of the italian and or eu research grants and loan subsidies previously received by biosearch and we might not qualify or be approved for new grants and subsidies 
biosearch and its subsidiary historically funded a portion of their operations through research grants and loan subsidies awarded by italian and eu authorities 
under applicable law  any transfer of those grants and subsidies including transfer by merger requires written approval from the italian bank 
in connection with the merger and the subsequent contribution to vicuron pharmaceuticals italy  srl  our wholly owned italian subsidiary  we applied for permission to transfer biosearch s grants and subsidies to our italian branch and subsidiary 
although the merger and the contribution have been completed  the italian and eu authorities have not as yet reached an official decision on whether to approve our transfer requests 
if the transfers are approved  we intend to apply for further permission to contribute the grants and subsidies to vicuron pharmaceuticals italy srl  our wholly owned subsidiary in italy 
we face the risk that one or both of the transfers might not be approved  in which case we might be required to repay some or all of the grants and subsidies received by biosearch prior to the merger  in the aggregate amount of up to approximately million as of december   and we may forfeit grants and subsidies awarded to biosearch but not yet disbursed as of december  by the authorized bank  in the aggregate amount of up to approximately million as of december  each estimate based on exchange rates then prevailing 
regardless of whether or not we are required to repay those grants  we anticipate that our italian subsidiary will be eligible to apply for new research grants and subsidies from both the italian and eu authorities 
however  grants and subsidies are awarded in the discretion of those authorities and we face the risk that our italian subsidiary might not qualify or be approved for any additional grants or subsidies in the future 

table of contents complying with two national regulatory structures might result in administrative challenges 
our operations must comply with applicable laws of and rules of the united states including delaware corporate law and the rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq national market  the eu legal system and the republic of italy including the rules and regulations of the commissione nazionale per le societ e la borsa  or consob  and borsa italiana  which collectively regulate companies listed on italy s public markets such as the nuovo mercato 
conducting our operations in a manner designed to comply with all applicable laws and rules will require us to allocate additional time and resources to regulatory compliance matters 
for example issuing each material announcement in both english and italian might cause administrative challenges  submitting filings and applications with regulatory and governmental authorities in the us  italy and the eu  and approving translations of each significant document into the other language  if necessary  might be time consuming and expensive  under italian employment law  our relations with our employees in italy are governed by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at the national level and over which we have no control  which reduce the methods customarily available in the united states to motivate and or make changes to our italian workforce  under european union data protection regulations  we are unable to send without restriction private personal data  including many employment records and some clinical trial data  from our italian offices to our us offices  and tariffs  customs  duties  import restrictions  tax effects and other trade barriers might delay or increase the cost of relocating personnel and  if marketing approvals are obtained  commercial quantities of our products between nations 
we are subject to risks resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar relative to the euro  which could cause costs to be greater than we expect and introduce additional volatility in our reported quarterly results 
as a result of the completed merger with biosearch  we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions insofar as we might desire to use dollars to make contract payments denominated in euros or vice versa 
as the net positions of our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuates  our earnings might be negatively affected 
in addition  we are exposed to risks associated with the translation of euro denominated financial results and balances and cash flows into us dollars 
although our reporting currency remains the us dollar  a portion of our consolidated revenues and costs now arise in euros  which we restate in dollars for purposes of financial reporting 
in addition  the reported carrying value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might introduce additional volatility in our reported results and accounts from period to period 
risks related to operating in our industry if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  or are unable to obtain them at all  for one or more of our product candidates  commercialization of those products will be delayed 
our efforts to develop and market our product candidates will be subject to extensive and rigorous domestic regulation 
fda rules govern  among other matters  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the united states 
any products that we market abroad will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
in order to obtain permission to sell our product candidates  we must provide the fda and 
table of contents foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data demonstrating that our proposed drugs are safe in humans and effective at treating an indicated condition 
none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market  and we cannot predict whether regulatory clearance will be obtained for any product that we are developing or intend to develop 
the regulatory review and approval process takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance  and might involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals might impede the commercialization of any drugs that we or our collaborators develop  require us or our collaborators to comply with costly additional procedures  diminish any competitive advantage that we or our collaborators might attain from early market introduction of a new product  and delay or eliminate our receipt of revenues or royalties 
any required approvals  once granted  might be withdrawn 
further  if we do not comply with applicable fda and foreign regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process  we might be subject to sanctions  including imposed delays in clinical trials or commercialization  refusal by the fda and foreign regulators to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications  product recalls or seizures  suspension of production  withdrawals of previously issued marketing approvals  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
we choose to develop some proprietary product candidates ourselves and to out license other product candidates to third parties for collaborative development 
the licensing or collaboration agreement will generally specify which party is responsible for directing the clinical trial process and seeking regulatory approvals 
regardless of whether the process is directed by us or by our collaborators  in each case we face the risk that our clinical trials might be unsuccessful  and that the fda will not grant us marketing approval 
we might also encounter delays or rejections based upon future changes in government regulation  legislation or fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
if we do not obtain required governmental approvals  we will be precluded from marketing the candidate for which approval was sought 
if regulatory clearance for marketing a future product is granted  this clearance will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective 
outside the united states  the ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with fda clearance described above and might include additional risks 
if our manufacturing subsidiary or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable good manufacturing practice requirements  we could be subject to fines or other sanctions  or be precluded from marketing any future products 
manufacturing facilities are required to comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
even facilities outside the united states  such as the manufacturing plant we are constructing in italy  must comply with these regulations if the manufactured products will be sold in the united states 
good manufacturing practice regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well 
table of contents as to maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the fda 
these facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our products 
comparable good manufacturing practice regulations also apply in the eu  italy and other foreign countries 
our contract manufacturers and our manufacturing subsidiary might not be able to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice requirements and other fda or other eu  italian or foreign regulatory agencies regulatory requirements 
if our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our product candidates or future products  others could compete against us more directly  which would harm our business 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties  which we will be able to do only to the extent that our intellectual property is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret 
we have rights relating to issued us patents  us patent applications  foreign patents and foreign patent applications 
of these patents and patent applications our non biosearch patent portfolio as of december  includes no us patents  us patent applications and eleven foreign patent applications  and our biosearch patent portfolio  as of december   includes an additional us patents  two us patent applications  foreign patents and foreign patent applications of which  dalbavancin related rights include four issued us patents and one hundred and thirteen foreign patent application 
our collaborations involve the following patents our license agreement with eli lilly with respect to anidulafungin covers us patents  us patent applications  foreign patents and foreign patent applications  our collaborative agreement with novartis covers two us patent applications  and our collaborative agreement with pfizer as successor to pharmacia with respect to the development of oxazolidinones covers four us patents  six us patent applications  two canadian patent applications and one foreign patent application 
the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether they will be enforceable 
we have in the past and might in the future receive office actions or other notices from us or foreign patent authorities seeking to limit or otherwise qualify some patent claims 
patents  if issued  might be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties might not provide any protection against competitors 
our pending patent applications  those we might file in the future  or those we might license from third parties  might not result in patents being issued 
also  we periodically review our us and foreign patent filings to determine whether their maintenance is commercially justified 
as a result  we may determine from time to time to abandon certain patent applications or allow certain patents to lapse 
moreover  patent rights might not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements might not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights could seriously impair our competitive position and harm our business 

table of contents if third parties claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights  we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from marketing our future products 
our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts 
this has resulted in a substantial number of issued patents and an even larger number of still pending patent applications 
us patent applications  which are not foreign filed can be maintained in secrecy until issuance 
us patent applications which are also intended for foreign filing usually publish months after the earliest priority date or within six months of the us filing date  whichever is later 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
our commercial success will depend significantly on an ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  our technologies might infringe the patents or violate other intellectual property rights of third parties without our knowledge 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if our defense is unsuccessful  we might be prevented from pursuing product development and commercialization and might be subject to damage awards 
our success also depends in part on our ability to prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property legal actions  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and internationally involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation might be necessary to enforce patents that we own or license  protect trade secrets or know how that we own or license  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
an adverse determination might subject us to loss of proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that might not be available from third parties 
we might be restricted or prevented from manufacturing and selling products  if any  in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
costs associated with these arrangements might be substantial and might include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our future products  if any  our revenues and prospects for profitability will be harmed 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our sales of any future products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payors 
such third party payors include government health administration authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payors are increasingly challenging the price  and examining the cost effectiveness  of medical products and services 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
we might need to conduct post marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of any future products to such payors satisfaction 
such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
our future products might not ultimately be considered cost effective 
adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development 
domestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of 
table of contents healthcare 
for example  in some foreign markets  the government controls prescription pharmaceuticals pricing and profitability 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals might change before our proposed products are approved for marketing 
adoption of such legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards 
the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products  might expose us to product liability claims 
we currently maintain  product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
such insurance coverage might not protect us against all of the claims to which we might become subject 
we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a claim is brought against us  we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
furthermore  whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims  we might be required to direct financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity could result  all of which could harm our business 
risks related to the securities markets our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile  and could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the results of our clinical trials and those of our competitors  and any significant delays or unexpected complications in our clinical trials  decisions by regulatory authorities with respect to our development efforts and product candidates  public concern regarding the safety and efficacy of drugs we develop  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  announcements of scientific innovations by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our annual and quarterly operating results  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic collaborations  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  general economic conditions  changes in  or failure to achieve  financial estimates by securities analysts  new regulatory legislation adopted in the united states or abroad  future sales of equity or debt securities by us  and sales of our common stock by our directors  officers or significant stockholders 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market  the nuovo mercato and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
over the week period ending december   the market price of vicuron common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of and our average daily trading volume was  shares 
volatility in the market price for particular companies has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors might seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been initiated following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated bylaws and our shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  increase the likelihood that any third party would need to negotiate with our board prior to initiating a takeover proposal for us and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company 
for example  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue preferred stock or  in the face of a potential acquiror s increased ownership  rights to purchase our common stock for a nominal price that could delay or prevent a change of control  as well as reduce the voting power of holders of our common stock 
in addition  some of our stockholders have entered into a stockholders agreement in which they have agreed  for a period of three years following completion of the merger  to vote as recommended by the board on some issues 
these provisions could delay or prevent an attempt to replace or remove our management 
the foregoing factors could also limit the price that investors or an acquiror might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our term loan and equipment notes with a commercial bank 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
however  due to the conservative and short term nature of these investments  such exposure is limited 
borrowings under our term loan and equipment loan are also exposed to interest rate risk as they are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate or libor 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the short term maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our debt obligations approximates the principal amounts due based on the interest rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 

table of contents inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the years presented 
currency risk as a result of our recently completed merger with biosearch  we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions insofar as we might desire to use us dollars to make contract payments denominated in euros or vice versa 
as the net positions of our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuates  our earnings might be negatively affected 
in addition  we are exposed to risks associated with the translation of euro denominated financial results and accounts into us dollars 
although our reporting currency remains the us dollar  a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and costs now arise in euros  which we restate in us dollars for purposes of financial reporting  based on exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable reporting period 
in addition  the reported carrying value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period
