asset liability management our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk policies designed to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and net present value of shareholders equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities is based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
we also had million of putable fhlb advances on the balance sheet as of march  that are assumed to reprice at maturity 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed 
march  months or less more than months to months more than months to months more than months to years more than years to years more than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash  investment securities and fhlb stock loans  leases and mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities loans and leases receivable  net total loans  leases and mortgage backed securities total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities fixed maturity deposits core deposits total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities based up on co ntractual maturities  repricing date and forecasted principal payments assuming normal amortization and  where applicable prepayments 
projected average constant prepayment rates cpr for the next twelve months are 
assumes of interest bearing core deposits are subject to repricing in year one and non interest bearing deposits are classified in the more than years category 
putable borrowings are presented based upon their contractual maturity date 
our one year gap at march  was ie more interest bearing liabilities subject to re pricing within one year than interest earning assets  this compares with an adjusted gap of at march  the march  gap report was adjusted to reflect the reporting of non interest bearing assets in the more than year gap bucket consistent with the current year presentation 
our one year gap has become more liability sensitive due to the slowing prepayments lengthening the repricing terms associated with the loan and securities portfolios  and an increase in the proportion of interest bearing core accounts which are reflected as subject to repricing within twelve months 
if rates were to increase by basis points  it is assumed that prepayment speeds would slow from an average of cpr to cpr and result in a one year gap of a gap table is limited to measuring timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk the risk that various indices to which our assets and liabilities are tied eg prime and cofi will not move with equal speed and magnitude when the general level of interest rates moves either up or down 
to better measure our exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
we forecast our net interest income for the next twelve months  and our npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  we subject our balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
our model then re forecasts net interest income and npv 
the table below indicates the results of our internal modeling of our balance sheet as of march  and the internal calculation of our sensitivity to interest rate changes would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if our customers responses to changes in interest rates resulted in changes in the structure of our balance sheet 
march  march  percentage change change in interest rates basis points net interest income net portfolio value net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for a one year period assuming we do not change the structure of our balance sheet 
this percentage change represents the npv for us assuming no changes to the structure of our balance sheet 
a negative basis point rate shock could not be calculated for march  and due to the low level of interest rates 
the results from the asset liability model indicate that net interest income has less sensitivity to changes in interest rates at march than was the case at march  and would actually decrease slightly in an up basis point rate scenario as of march   rather than increase in an up basis point rate scenario a year earlier 
the change in earnings sensitivity was due to several factors 
the first factor impacting net interest income sensitivity was the level of prepayments on loans and securities 
at march   the high rate of payoffs had the impact of shortening asset lives creating a greater ability for asset yields to move up or down with any rate movements 
anticipated prepayments as of march  are somewhat slower due to the anticipation of rate increases in the coming year 
this reduction in prepayment estimates has the impact of lengthening the asset lives reducing the ability for yields to adjust 
the high level of prepayments experienced in prior years also significantly reduced the seasoning of our hybrid arm portfolio at march  compared to march  as seasoned loans were replaced by newly originated product 
as a result  our portfolio at march  has a greater percentage of hybrid arm s with longer periods to their first reset than at march  we have also changed our modeling for our interest bearing now and money market deposit products 
while core deposit accounts are anticipated to exhibit less sensitivity to rate changes than either cd accounts or fixed rate borrowings  it is anticipated that they will exhibit greater sensitivity to upward movements in rates at march  than one year earlier 
this increased sensitivity is anticipated as a result of continued reductions to the rate on those products over the past year and an increasingly competitive deposit market 
for the year ended march   the average cost of our core deposit portfolio was  a basis point reduction from the prior year 
our repeated rate reductions on core deposits have left depositors with a greater opportunity to increase returns by transferring to other investment products including cds 
it is important to note the general competitive environment 
at this time last year  we were not witnessing significant rate driven competition for our deposit customers 
as we enter fiscal  we are seeing an increase in short term certificate and money market promotions 
some of these products are being offered at rates more than basis points above the levels we are currently paying on our comparable core deposits products 
while we will continue to make every effort to retain our customers through reasonable rate negotiation and promotional offerings there is an increasing possibility that some of our core deposit customers may be attracted to promotional rates offered by our competitors 
our modeling indicates increased sensitivity to the npv of equity at march  compared to march  the factors discussed above affecting the sensitivity of earnings have contributed to the increase in the sensitivity of npv 
the high prepayment levels assumed at march  created a high level of asset turnover resulting in shorter asset durations 
these short durations allowed us to continually replace assets at current market values 
the slower prepayment levels assumed at march  combined with the reduced seasoning of hybrid arm s increased asset durations resulting in a greater percentage of our balance sheet being comprised of assets whose market values are more sensitive to declining as rates rise 
the change in sensitivity of npv was also impacted by changes in our funding mix 
at march   percent of our total asset base was funded with deposits compared to percent at march  deposit accounts exhibit lower sensitivity to rate changes than do borrowings 
the lower sensitivity provides greater stability for funding costs during times of rising interest rates 
this stability in funding costs is expressed as a deposit intangible in modeling of npv 
typically the market value of the deposit intangible moves inversely with the market value of assets 
that is to say when rates rise  the market value of assets will typically decline and the value of the deposit intangible will increase 
with a greater percentage of assets funded with fhlb advances  there is less deposit intangible available to counter the impact of changing interest rates 
also reducing the deposit intangible value is the anticipation of greater sensitivity for core deposits noted above 
overview our net income for fiscal totaled million or per diluted share  up from fiscal s million or per diluted share  and fiscal s million or per diluted share 
the increase in our net income between fiscal years primarily reflected the following increases in net interest income arising from a combination of increases in net interest spread and growth in average interest earning assets 
decreases in provision for loan and lease losses attributable to an improvement in the level of asset quality and a reduction in the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio 
increases in non interest income arising from increases in loan and servicing fees from higher volumes of loan repayments 
increases in deposit and related fees arising from growth in transaction accounts 
increases in gain on sales of securities 
an increase in other non interest income for fiscal arising from an increase in cash surrender value of split dollar life insurance policies 
these favorable items were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense attributable principally to compensation and benefits expense 
our return on average assets fell slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal but increased to for fiscal our return on average equity exhibited similar behavior at for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal as reflected in the following table  we continued to focus our loan origination activities on the four cs 
amount percentage of total amount percentage of total amount percentage of total dollars in thousands construction and land commercial r 
e consumer commercial business and leases subtotal four cs residential and other total originations includes family and multi family 
despite the significant increases in four cs originations shown above  due to the very high level of loan paydown activity during fiscal across all loan product categories  the net disbursed balance of the four cs increased only million between march  and after increasing million between march  and in order to achieve our overall asset growth objectives and to offset the impact of the high level of principal repayments  we purchased million of loans during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal because the overwhelming majority of those purchases were single family residential mortgages  the growth in that segment of the loan and lease portfolio outpaced that of the four cs and the proportion of the portfolio in the four cs decreased slightly from of loans and leases receivable  net at march  to at march  we expect that with a reduction in the level of loan repayment activity that is expected to accompany an increase in mortgage interest rates  we will not experience further erosion in the proportion of the loan and lease portfolio comprised by the four cs 
we continued to focus our deposit gathering activities on core deposits 
core deposits increased million during fiscal while cds decreased million 
this pattern of activity is consistent with prior fiscal years  in which core deposits increased million while cds decreased million during fiscal  and core deposits increased million and cds decreased million during fiscal the significant funding cost advantage to core deposits over cds continues to play a significant role in our increasing profitability 
we increased fhlb advances and other borrowings by million during fiscal to bridge the differential between total asset growth of million and total deposit growth of million 
non accrual loans were million or of gross loans and leases at march  compared to million and million or and of gross loan and leases at march  and  respectively 
see lending activities allowance for loan and lease losses 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
at march    shares remain under an  share repurchase authorization adopted by our board of directors on march  at march   our consolidated capital to assets ratio was 
the bank s core and risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and respectively to be considered well capitalized 
see regulation and supervision 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and leases  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities are the principal items affecting net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in fiscal  up from fiscal and million or from fiscal this trend reflects consistent increases in net interest spread from for fiscal to for fiscal to for fiscal these increases in net interest spread reflect our success in transitioning our balance sheet to a higher margin business model by focusing on the four cs and core deposits 
contributing to the increase in net interest income were increases in average interest earning assets of million or for fiscal and million or for fiscal our net interest spread and net interest income are also impacted by the repricing or rate adjustment characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by average interest earning assets for the year 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits and borrowings for the years indicated 
we included non accrual loans in the average interest earning assets balance 
we included interest from non accrual loans in interest income only to the extent we received payments and to the extent we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loans 
we computed average balances for the year using the average of each month s daily average balance during the years indicated 
average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to us for the years ended march   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from average daily balances

see lending activities allowance for loan and lease losses 
non interest income our total non interest income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal deposit and related fees deposit and related fees totaled million in fiscal  up  from fiscal and million from fiscal these increases reflect increases in the number of checking accounts  which create additional monthly fees as well as transactional charges 
the following table presents a breakdown of deposit and related fees during the years indicated 
dollars in thousands monthly maintenance and deposit related service fees automated teller machine fees other fees total deposit and related fees loan and servicing fees loan and servicing fees totaled million for fiscal  up million from fiscal and million from fiscal the primary factor contributing to these increases was an increase in loan principal paydowns from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal loan and servicing fee income is shown net of amortization of our msr asset 
the following table presents a breakdown of loan and servicing fees for the years indicated dollars in thousands loan servicing fees amortization of msr impairment of msr at march   our msr asset was  trust and investment fees trust and investment fees increased from million for both fiscal and fiscal to million for fiscal assets under custody or management were million  million and million at march   and  respectively 
assets under custody or management at march   include million managed by glencrest  which includes million of assets generated by glencrest with the remainder representing assets generated by the bank s trust department 
gain on sale of loans our community banking business strategy does not include aggressively pursuing the origination of loans for sale 
the four cs have consistently comprised in excess of of total originations and those four product types are originated for portfolio as opposed to sale 
additionally  we retain for portfolio virtually all adjustable rate residential mortgages 
accordingly  the principal balances of loans sold during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
this activity generated net gains on sales of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
gain on sale of securities we generally follow a buy and hold strategy with respect to our securities portfolio 
while the overwhelming majority of our securities portfolio is classified as available for sale  sales activity has been and is expected to continue to be infrequent 
gain on sales of securities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and  for fiscal the sales during fiscal were initiated primarily to reduce our exposure to a marketable equity security  which had performed exceptionally well 
as a result of this strong price appreciation  prudent risk diversification required that the investment be reduced  although not eliminated  to reduce concentration in any single security 
during fiscal we sold million of securities which was primarily composed of higher coupon mbs that had been experiencing or were expected to experience increased levels of prepayments in a lower interest rate environment 
loss on trading securities we liquidated our portfolio of trading securities during march after determining that such activity was inconsistent with our strategic direction and business model 
accordingly  there was no gain or loss on trading securities during fiscal we incurred net losses on trading activity during fiscal and of  and  respectively 
other non interest income our other non interest income of million for fiscal is up substantially from  for fiscal and  for fiscal the million increase between fiscal and was attributable to a million non recurring increase in cash surrender value of split dollar life insurance policies that we own 
the total non interest income arising from increases in cash surrender value during fiscal  and was million   and  respectively 
at march   our balance sheet includes total cash surrender value of million classified as other assets 
non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal and million or of average assets for fiscal while our balance sheet  which is increasingly comprised by four cs and core deposits  generates higher levels of net interest income than would a balance sheet comprised by residential mortgage loans and cds  our higher margin business is also more cost intensive  particularly with respect to compensation levels 
the relationship between net revenue net interest income plus non interest income and operating costs expended to generate that revenue is measured by our efficiency ratio 
our efficiency ratio was for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal while our ratio of general and administrative expense to average assets increased basis points or between fiscal and  our efficiency ratio only deteriorated basis points or 
this indicates that the growth in our operating cost structure was substantially offset by increases in net revenue generated by our higher margin business model 
the ratio of general and administrative expense to average assets and efficiency ratio for fiscal compared to fiscal exhibits a similar relationship to that between fiscal and fiscal with a increase in the general and administrative expense ratio and a increase in the efficiency ratio 
the more positive relationship between fiscal and compared to the relationship between fiscal and reflects the fact that we must incur the infrastructure costs to support the higher volumes of business in advance of those volumes coming on the books 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense accounted for million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and fiscal and million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and these increases reflect increases in both the number and compensation levels of staff required to support our higher margin lending four cs and deposit gathering core deposits activities 
the increases in compensation and benefits also reflect the bank s opening of two new full service retail branches during fiscal  and the formation and staffing up of glencrest investment advisors 
included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal  and  respectively are non cash charges of million  million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
the stock awarded under the incentive plan vested over a five year period ending october accordingly  the non cash charge to expense associated with the incentive plan decreased from million for fiscal to zero for fiscal and  respectively 
the allocation of shares under the bank s esop will continue in generally equal installments through the amount charged to expense under the esop moves upward or downward with changes in the market price of the bancorp s common stock 
esop expense for fiscal  and was million million and million  respectively 
marketing and professional services the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal was attributable to the marketing efforts associated with the two new branch openings as well as an increase in expenditures associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities we serve 
other general and administrative expense our other general and administrative expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the million increase between fiscal and was primarily attributable to an increase in correspondent bank service charges and appraisal fees resulting from higher volumes of deposit and loan activity  and compliance with sarbanes oxley 
the increase between fiscal and was primarily attributable to increased appraisal fees and correspondent bank service charges resulting from higher volumes of loan and deposit activity 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the effective income tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
our tax rate increased in fiscal  primarily due to a permanent difference associated with our esop plan  whereby the difference between the fair value of our stock over the tax cost of our stock is not a deduction for federal and state income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost effective basis 
our most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million 
effective july  the ots adopted a rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
our internal policy is to maintain cash and readily marketable debt securities with final maturities of one year or less equal to approximately three percent of total deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings maturing within one year 
at and for the year ended march  our defined liquidity ratios were percent and percent  respectively 
as an additional component of liquidity management  we seek to maintain sufficient mortgage and securities collateral at the fhlb to enable us to immediately borrow an amount equal to at least five percent of total assets 
at march   our immediate borrowing capacity was million or percent of total assets 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  leases and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  and to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  leases and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our strategy is to manage liquidity by investing excess cash flows in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans  leases and securities  or paying down fhlb advances and other borrowings  depending on market conditions 
conversely  if the need for funds is not met through deposits and cash flows from loans  leases and securities  we initiate fhlb advances and other borrowings  or if necessary and of economic benefit  sell loans and or securities 
only when no other alternatives exist will we constrain loan originations as a means of addressing a liquidity shortfall 
we have not found it necessary to constrain loan originations due to liquidity considerations 
our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the variability in cash flows provided by operating activities among the fiscal years ended march   and was attributable principally to increases decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases decreases were attributable principally to timing differences relating to securities purchased on march  that were recorded on our balance sheet using the trade date  with settlement in cash occurring on the following day of the new fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of disbursements for loan and lease originations and purchases and purchases of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  leases and proceeds from maturation and paydowns on securities 
the levels of cash flows from investing activities are influenced by the general level of interest rates 
during periods of declining rates  borrowers exhibit an increasing propensity to refinance their indebtedness  which results in an increase in cash flows from loan  lease and securities paydowns 
accordingly  we reinvest those cash flows into originations and purchases of loans and purchases of securities in order to effectively manage our cash resources 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in cash used in investing activities was attributable to our increased emphasis on growth in interest earning assets beginning during the later stages of fiscal and accelerating into fiscal reflecting the acceleration in cash flows arising from a declining rate environment described above  principal payments on loans and leases increased from billion for the year ended march  to billion and billion for the years ended march  and  respectively 
in response to the increased cash inflows from loans and leases  we increased our disbursements for loan originations and purchases  excluding loans originated for sale  from billion for the year ended march  to billion and billion for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the pattern of activity with respect to cash provided by financing activities generally corresponds to that of net cash used in investing activities 
the primary sources of net cash from financing activities are net activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances and other borrowings 
our net increases in deposits were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
during the year ended march   we increased our use of fhlb advances to fund the higher level of interest earning asset growth 
accordingly  fhlb advances and other borrowings increased million during the year ended march  as compared to a decrease of million for the year ended march  we began fiscal with a higher than normal level of cash and cash equivalents million at march  compared to million at march  and million at march  due to a higher level of loan and securities payoffs received late during fiscal this excess cash was used to fund loan growth during the early part of fiscal reducing our need to increase borrowings during fiscal deposits  particularly core deposits  provide a more preferable source of funding than do fhlb advances and other borrowings 
however  as and to the extent competitive or market factors do not allow us to meet our funding needs with deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings provide a readily available source of liquidity 
as of march  and  the bank had maximum unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb of san francisco of billion and billion  respectively 
based upon pledged collateral in place  the available borrowing capacity was million and million at march  and  respectively 
we also have the ability to borrow funds under reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by securities 
we had million and million of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at march  and  respectively 
additionally  we have the capability to borrow funds from the federal reserve bank discount window 
as of march   our borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank was approximately million 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
see item description of business regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation 
we currently have no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures 
see item description of business general 
at march   we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans of million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  at march  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our commitments 
at march   we had  of outstanding commitments to purchase securities 
at march  we had no outstanding commitments to purchase securities 
see item description of business general 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
we expect that we will retain a substantial portion of the funds from maturing certificate accounts at maturity either in certificate or liquid accounts 
the continued low interest rate environment during fiscal has resulted in a reduction in the differential between certificate accounts and more liquid instruments such as money market accounts 
accordingly  a portion of our maturing certificate accounts have been and are expected to continue to be reinvested by customers into more liquid accounts until such time as the rate differential between certificate and liquid accounts increases 
contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
our obligations generally relate to funding of our operations through deposits and borrowings as well as leases for premises and equipment  and our commitments generally relate to our lending operations 
we have obligations under long term operating leases  principally for building space and land 
lease terms generally cover a five year period  with options to extend  and are non cancelable 
currently  we have no significant vendor contractual obligations 
our commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed  but committed to construction projects and home equity and commercial lines of credit 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since some commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines and letters of credit requires the same creditworthiness evaluation as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness 
we receive collateral to support commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral include real estate properties underlying mortgage loans  liens on personal property and cash on deposits with us 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations at march  the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts  or other similar carrying value adjustments further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
note reference within year to years to years over years total certificates of deposit fhlb advances reverse repurchase agreements promissory note operating leases commitments to originate loans and leases fixed rate variable rate commitments to purchase variable rate loans total undisbursed loan commitments balance construction consumers commercial letter of credit impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
segment reporting we provide a broad range of financial services to individuals and companies located primarily in southern california 
these services include demand  time  and savings deposits  real estate  business and consumer lending  cash management  trust services  investment advisory services and diversified financial services to homebuilders 
while our chief decision makers monitor the revenue streams of our various products and services  operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company wide basis 
accordingly  all of our operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  leases  investments and other interest earnings assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
loan and lease volumes and yields  as well as the volume and rates on investments  deposits and borrowings  are affected by market interest rates 
additionally  because of the terms and conditions of many of our loan and lease agreements and deposit accounts  a change in rates could also affect the duration of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base  which could alter our sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration  among other factors  our overall credit  operating income  operating cost and capital profile 
disclosure related to market risk is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability management contained in item of this form k
