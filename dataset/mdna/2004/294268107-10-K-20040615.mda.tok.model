item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended march   and the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  customer demand for our products and services  supplier costs  interest rate fluctuations and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment we lease 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of the sale of equipment in our lease portfolio prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party 
such sales of leased equipment prior to the expiration of the lease term may have the effect of increasing revenues and net earnings during the period in which the sale occurs  and reducing revenues and net earnings otherwise expected in subsequent periods 
we currently derive the majority of our revenue from sales and financing of information technology and other assets 
we have expanded our product and service offerings under our eplus enterprise cost management model which represents the continued evolution of our original implementation of eplus e commerce products entitled eplussuite 
the expansion to our eecm model is a framework that combines our it sales and professional services  leasing and financing services  asset management software and services  procurement software  and electronic catalog content management software and services 
we expect to expand or open new sales locations and hire additional staff for specific targeted market areas in the near future whenever we can find both experienced personnel and qualified geographic areas 
on may   we acquired from procurenet  inc the e commerce procurement software asset products and software technology for cleaning and categorizing product descriptions for e commerce catalogues 
these products and services and associated expenses with this business acquisition have substantially increased our expenses and the ability to sell these services and products is expected to fluctuate depending on the customer demand for these products and services  which to date is still unproven 
these products and services are included in our technology sales unit business segment combined with our other sales of it products and services 
our leasing and financing activities are included in our financing business unit segment in our financial statements 
as a result of our acquisitions and expansion of sales locations  the company s historical results of operations and financial position may not be indicative of its future performance over time 
critical accounting policies the manner in which lease finance transactions are characterized and reported for accounting purposes has a major impact upon reported revenue and net earnings 
lease accounting methods critical to our business are discussed below 
we classify our lease transactions  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as direct financing  sales type  or operating leases 
revenues and expenses between accounting periods for each lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification 
for financial statement purposes  we present revenue from all three classifications in lease revenues  and costs related to these leases in direct lease costs 
direct financing and sales type leases 
direct financing and sales type leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
a lease is a direct financing or sales type lease if the creditworthiness of the customer and the collectability of lease payments are reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair market value of the leased equipment at the inception of the lease 
direct financing leases are recorded as investment in direct financing leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the commencement of the lease  unearned lease income is recorded which represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the equipment exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as lease revenue over the lease term 
sales type leases include a dealer profit or loss that is recorded by the lessor at the inception of the lease 
the equipment subject to such leases may be obtained in the secondary marketplace or is the result of re leasing our own portfolio 
for equipment supplied from our technology sales business unit subsidiaries  the dealer margin is presented in equipment sales revenue 
interest earned on the present value of the lease payments and residual value is recognized over the lease term using the interest method and is included in our lease revenues 
operating leases 
all leases that do not meet the criteria to be classified as direct financing or sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as lease revenue 
our cost of the leased equipment is recorded on the balance sheet as investment in leases and leased equipment and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to our estimate of residual value 
revenue  depreciation expense and the resulting profit for operating leases are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
lease revenues consist of rentals due under operating leases and amortization of unearned income on direct financing and sales type leases 
equipment under operating leases is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the company s estimate of residual value 
for lease periods subsequent to the initial term  revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment by the lessees since collection of such amounts is not reasonably assured 
such revenues recognized were   and  for the years ended on march    and  respectively 
as a result of these three classifications of leases for accounting purposes  the revenues resulting from the mix of lease classifications during an accounting period will affect the profit margin percentage for such period and such profit margin percentage generally increases as revenues from direct financing and sales type leases increase 
should a lease be financed  the interest expense declines over the term of the financing as the principal is reduced 
residual values 
residual values represent our estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the residual values for direct financing and sales type leases are reported as part of the investment in direct financing and sales type leases  on a net present value basis 
the residual values for operating leases are included in the leased equipment s net book value and are reported in the investment in operating lease equipment 
the estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and depend upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions and the term of the lease 
we evaluate residual values on an ongoing basis and record any required changes in accordance with sfas no 
residual values are affected by equipment supply and demand and by new product announcements by manufacturers 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  residual value estimates are adjusted downward when such assets are impaired 
we seek to realize the estimated residual value at lease termination through renewal or extension of the original lease  sale of the equipment either to the lessee or on the secondary market  or lease of the equipment to a new customer 
the difference between the proceeds of a sale and the remaining estimated residual value is recorded as a gain or loss in lease revenues when title is transferred to the lessee  or  if the equipment is sold on the secondary market  in equipment sales revenues and cost of equipment sales when title is transferred to the buyer 
for lease transactions subsequent to the initial lease term  our policy is to recognize revenues upon the payment by the lessee  as collectibility is not reasonably assured 
initial direct costs 
initial direct costs related to the successful origination of direct financing or operating leases are capitalized and recorded as part of the net investment in direct financing leases  or net operating lease equipment  and are amortized over the lease term 
sales of product 
sales of product include the following types of transactions sales of new or used equipment which is not subject to any type of lease  service revenue in our technology sales business unit  sales of off lease equipment to the secondary market  and sales of third party software 
sales of new or used equipment are recognized upon shipment and sales of off lease equipment are recognized when constructive title passes to the purchaser 
service revenue is recognized as the related services are rendered 
software sales and related costs 
revenue from sales of procurement software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize revenue when all the following criteria exist when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  no significant obligations by the company with regard to implementation remain  the sales price is determinable  and it is probable that collection will occur 
our accounting policy requires that revenue earned and related costs incurred on software arrangements involving multiple elements be allocated to each element on the relative fair values of the elements and recognized when earned 
revenue related to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term usually one year and revenue allocated to training  implementation or other services is recognized as the services are performed 
these revenues are included in fee and other income on our consolidated statement of earnings 
sales of leased equipment 
sales of leased equipment consist of sales of equipment subject to an existing lease  under which we are lessor  including any underlying financing related to the lease 
sales of equipment subject to an existing lease are recognized when constructive title passes to the purchaser 
other sources of revenue 
amounts charged for procure  our e procurement software package  are recognized as services are rendered 
amounts charged for the manage  our asset management software service  are recognized on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
fee and other income results from income from events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset  re marketing fees  brokerage fees earned for the placement of financing transactions  agent fees received from various manufacturers in the reseller business  and interest and other miscellaneous income 
these revenues are included in fee and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
reserve for credit losses 
the reserve for credit losses is maintained at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the company s lease and accounts receivable portfolio 
as of march  and  the company s reserve for credit losses was and million  respectively 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an evaluation of historical credit loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  the composition of the lease portfolio  and other relevant factors 
the reserve is increased by provisions for potential credit losses charged against income 
accounts are either written off or written down when the loss is both probable and determinable  after giving consideration to the customer s financial condition  the value of the underlying collateral and funding status ie  discounted on a non recourse or recourse basis

the company s fee and other income contains earnings from certain transactions which are in the company s normal course of business but there is no guarantee that future transactions of the same nature  size or profitability will occur 
the company s ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely upon factors outside the direct control of management 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
the company s direct lease costs increased during the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the largest component of direct lease costs is depreciation expense of leased equipment

cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to million during the same period 
the effect of exchange rate changes during the period provided cash flows of  the net effect of these cash flows was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year 
during the same period  our total assets increased million  primarily as the result of increases in our net accounts receivable 
the company s net investments in direct financing lease equipment decreased million  or  and operating lease equipment increased million  or  respectively  during the period 
the cash balance at march  was million as compared to million the prior year 
the company s debt financing activities typically provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment purchased by the company for lease to its customers 
any balance of the purchase price the company s equity investment in the equipment must generally be financed by cash flow from its operations  the sale of the equipment leased to third parties  or other internal means 
although the company expects that the credit quality of its leases and its residual return history will continue to allow it to obtain such financing  no assurances can be given that such financing will be available  at acceptable terms  or at all 
the financing necessary to support the company s leasing activities has principally been provided by non recourse and recourse borrowings 
historically  the company has obtained recourse and non recourse borrowings from banks and finance companies 
non recourse financings are loans whose repayment is the responsibility of a specific customer  although we may make representations and warranties to the lender regarding the specific contract or have ongoing loan servicing obligations 
under a non recourse loan  we borrow from a lender an amount based on the present value of the contractually committed lease payments under the lease at a fixed rate of interest  and the lender secures a lien on the financed assets 
when the lender is fully repaid from the lease payment  the lien is released and all further rental or sale proceeds are ours 
we are not liable for the repayment of non recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements 
the lender assumes the credit risk of each lease  and their only recourse  upon default by the lessee  is against the lessee and the specific equipment under lease 
recently  the company has funded its leasing activities with bank of america vendor finance  inc including fleet business credit llc  de lage landen financial services  inc  citizens leasing corporation  fifth third bank  ge capital corporation  hitachi capital america corporation  jp morgan leasing  inc  wells fargo equipment finance  inc 
and key corporate capital inc  among others 
each transaction is specifically approved and done solely at the lender s discretion 
during the year ended march   the company s lease related non recourse debt portfolio increased to million 
whenever desirable and possible  the company arranges for equity investment financing which includes selling assets including the residual portions to third parties and financing the equity investment on a non recourse basis 
the company generally retains customer control and operational services  and has minimal residual risk 
the company usually preserves the right to share in remarketing proceeds of the equipment on a subordinated basis after the investor has received an agreed to return on its investment 
the company s accounts payable equipment represents equipment costs that have been placed on a lease schedule  but for which the company has not yet paid 
the balance of unpaid equipment cost can vary depending on vendor terms and the timing of lease originations 
as of march   the company had million of unpaid equipment cost  as compared to million at march  working capital for our leasing business is provided through a  credit facility expiring on july  participating in this facility are branch banking and trust company  bank of america  and national city bank  the agent 
the ability to borrow under this facility is limited to the amount of eligible collateral at any given time 
the credit facility has full recourse to the company and is secured by a blanket lien against all of the company s assets such as chattel paper including leases  receivables  inventory  and equipment and including the common stock of all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants and certain restrictions on  among other things  the company s ability to make certain investments  and sell assets or merge with another company 
the interest rates charged on borrowings are the higher of the libor interest rate plus to  or the higher of the federal funds rate plus to or prime rate 
as of march   the company had no outstanding balance on the facility 
in general  we use the national city bank facility to pay the cost of equipment to be put on lease  and we repay borrowings from the proceeds of long term  non recourse  fixed rate financing which we obtain from lenders after the underlying lease transaction is finalized or sales of leases to third parties 
the loss of this credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we may have to use this facility for daily working capital and liquidity for our leasing business 
the availability of the credit facility is subject to a borrowing base formula that consists of inventory  receivables  purchased assets  and lease assets 
availability under the credit facility may be limited by the asset value of the equipment purchased by us or by terms and conditions in the credit facility agreement 
if we are unable to sell the equipment or unable to finance the equipment on a permanent basis within a certain time period  the availability of credit under the facility could be diminished or eliminated 
the credit facility contains covenants relating to minimum tangible net worth  cash flow coverage ratios  maximum debt to equity ratio  maximum guarantees of subsidiary obligations  mergers and acquisitions and asset sales 
eplus technology of nc  inc  eplus technology of pa  inc 
and eplus technology  inc  until they were merged on march   had separate credit facilities to finance their working capital requirements for inventories and accounts receivable 
after the entities were merged into eplus technology  inc  the credit facilities were effectively merged into one by ge distribution finance corporation gecdf 
the floor planning line from ibm credit corporation was terminated on march  the outstanding balances on the ibm credit corporation as of march  were paid subsequent to year end and further borrowings on this line have ceased 
the traditional business of eplus technology as a seller of computer technology and related network equipment and software products is financed through agreements known as floor planning financing in which interest expense for the first thirty to forty five days is not charged but is paid by the supplier distributor 
the floor planning liabilities are recorded as accounts payable trade  as they are normally repaid within the thirty to forty five day time frame and represent an assigned accounts payable originally generated with the supplier distributor 
if the thirty to forty five day obligation is not paid timely  interest is then assessed at stated contractual rates 
the floor planning inventory agreement with gecdf had a maximum credit limit of  for each year and the outstanding balances were  and  as of march  and  respectively 
in addition to the floor planning financing  eplus technology  inc  has an accounts receivable facility through gecdf with a maximum amount that can be borrowed of  at march   there was no outstanding balance on this account receivable facility and  was outstanding on this facility as of march  borrowing availability under the gecdf facilities is limited to specific allowable collateral asset values and also must comply with contractual covenants regarding tangible net worth  a debt to equity ratio  dividend restrictions and limitations on asset sales 
the facilities provided by gecdf have a guaranty of up to  by eplus inc 
loss of the gecdf facility  which can occur with days notice from gecdf  could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we rely on these facilities for daily working capital and liquidity for our technology sales business and operational accounts payable functions 
the company had two subordinated recourse notes payable with a total principal amount due of million to centura bank resulting from the acquisition of clg  inc in september these notes were originally due in october  but could be repaid at any earlier date  and had an interest rate payable monthly 
these notes were paid off on august  in connection with a settlement 
in the normal course of business  the company may provide certain customers with performance guarantees  which are generally backed by surety bonds 
in general  the company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations  the probability of which is remote in management s opinion 
the company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee  and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in addition  the company has other guarantees that represent parent guarantees in support of the eplus technology  inc 
floor planning and accounts receivable financing up to million 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of march  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years nonrecourse notes payable     recourse notes payable   operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    total     nonrecourse notes payable obligations in which the specific lease receivable payments have been assigned to the lender 
rent obligations telecommunications related contracts off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of march   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entity transactions 
adequacy of capital resources the continued implementation of the company s eecm business strategy will require a significant investment in both resources and managerial focus 
in addition  the company may selectively acquire other companies that have attractive customer relationships and skilled sales forces 
the company may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance the platform of eecm to provide additional functionality and value added services 
as a result  the company may require additional financing to fund its strategy implementation and potential future acquisitions  which may include additional debt and equity financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of the company s liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  the company is reliant upon lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes  are denominated in us dollars  and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the national city bank and ge distribution finance corporation formerly deutsche financial services corporation facilities  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the national city and ge distribution finance corporation facilities bear interest at a market based variable rate  based on a rate selected by the company and determined at the time of borrowing 
due to the relatively short nature of the interest rate periods  we do not expect our operating results or cash flow to be materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of our recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value 
during the year ended march   the company began transacting business in canada 
as such  the company has entered into lease contracts and non recourse  fixed interest rate financing denominated in canadian dollars 
to date  canadian operations have been insignificant and the company believes that potential fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material effect on its financial position
