the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview of business we design  develop and market integrated circuits for digital media applications  such as digital television  liquid crystal display lcd television and digital set top boxes 
our system on chip semiconductors provide the intelligence for these new types of displays by processing and optimizing video and computer graphic signals to produce high quality and realistic images 
many of the world s leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and computer display products utilize our technology to enhance image quality and ease of use of their products 
our goal is to provide the best image quality enhanced digital media integrated circuits at competitive prices to users 
we sell our products primarily to digital television original equipment manufacturers in china  korea  taiwan and japan 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of customers 
our top five customers accounted for of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  substantially all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
our products are manufactured primarily by united microelectronics corporation umc  a semiconductor manufacturer located in taiwan  which also owns a minority interest in tti 
we operate primarily through subsidiaries and offices located in california  taiwan and china 
trident microsystems  inc tmi  located in sunnyvale  california  acts as an administrative home office  operating through our owned subsidiary  trident technology  inc tti  located in taipei  taiwan  tti s us branch located in sunnyvale  california and our owned subsidiary  trident multimedia technologies shanghai co  ltd 

table of contents tmt  located in shanghai  china 
our net income is determined after taking a charge for the share of income relating to the minority interest in tti 
references to we  trident  or the company in this report refer to trident microsystems  inc and its subsidiaries  including tti which was owned by tmi as of june   and was owned by tmi as of june  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize product sales as revenue  generally upon shipment  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
sales to resellers with rights of return or price protection are generally recognized upon shipment to end user customers 
approximately of sales in fiscal flowed through distributors 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions  historical returns  inventory levels at distributors and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and comply with the disclosure provisions of statements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb no 
 compensation cost is generally recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of our stock on the date of grant and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and 
table of contents market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we currently evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and or a significant decline in the our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus  three of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future

the volume of digital media units increased by more than  however as is typical in consumer electronics markets  the average selling price eroded by an amount in the range of 
the aggregate average selling price continues to be in a range of per unit 
no revenue was recorded for graphics products in the year ended june  as a result of the transfer of the graphics division to xgi in july total revenues decreased in fiscal to million  or  from million reported in fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the decrease in unit volume shipments of desktop and notebook pc products in fiscal sales of digital media products represented approximately million or of total

approximately of sales in fiscal went through distributors 
in the year ended june   one of our key oem customers ordered a lower volume of products than expected due to the customer s inventory transition issues 
although we expect this customer s inventory transition to be resolved in a timely manner  in forecasting our sequential growth  we do not expect a complete resolution by the end of the quarter ending september  however  we expect to ship the svp ex to this customer in the month of september  and expect the customer volumes to be higher in the december quarter and back to normal levels moving into calendar gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases were primarily due to a relative increase in sales of digital media products which have higher margins than pc graphics products 
our strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins  and reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yield and utilizing newer process technology 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and from million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars spent in fiscal was primarily the result of decreased spending on research and development relating to graphics products 
we plan to continue developing the next generation dptv product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital set top boxes stb for the digital television market in china  japan  korea and taiwan 
however  there can be no assurance that these products will be quickly or widely accepted by consumers in the market place  or that the new products will be developed and shipped in a timely manner 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to an increase in professional fees and an increase in administrative expenses relating to our restructuring activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in from primarily as a result of lower selling expenses due to a decrease in revenue for graphic products 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net net interest and other expense of  in fiscal  was comprised of an expense of  primarily due to currency exchange losses and investment expenses  partially offset by interest income of  net interest and other expense was  in fiscal representing an expense of  partially offset by interest income of  interest income declined in fiscal due to lower applicable interest rates as compared to fiscal interest income declined in fiscal due to lower cash balances and lower applicable interest rates as compared to fiscal the amount of interest income we earn varies directly with the amount of our cash and cash equivalents balances and prevailing interest rates 
minority interests in subsidiaries the million recorded for minority interests in subsidiaries in fiscal represents the share of income relating to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries 
the amount of such charges is dependent upon the income and minority ownership in our subsidiaries  tti in particular 
the percentage held by minority shareholders will increase in the future if employees of tti exercise options to acquire tti stock  or if we determine to sell further interests in tti to outside investors 
we continue to explore the possibility of an ipo in taiwan which would increase the minority ownership in tti 
however  no final decision has been reached in this regard 
the ipo process typically takes approximately years in taiwan  at this point  even if the company were to decide to move forward the earliest such an event might take place would be during the summer of we have taken preliminary steps to enable an ipo  which include filing for regulatory approvals and most recently  agreeing to facilitate sales of unlisted securities  including the sale by tmi of a small number of less than of its holdings to enable a taiwan securities firm to make an orderly market 
going forward  whether an ipo occurs or not  tmi s long term strategy is to maintain a majority interest in tti 
provision benefit for income taxes a provision for income taxes of million was recorded for the fiscal year ended june  of which million related to our operations in taiwan 
for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million to increase our valuation allowance and reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset to zero 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  including consideration of historical and future estimated taxable losses  we concluded that it was more likely than not our net deferred tax asset would not be realized 
the net deferred tax asset arose during fiscal due to decreases in our deferred tax liabilities associated with cumulative unrealized holding gains on our umc investment 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended june  the income tax benefit was primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the write downs of our umc investment 
investment in umc and other investments as of june   the company owned approximately million shares of united microelectronics corporation umc  which represents about of the outstanding stock of umc 
in the quarter ended september   we concluded that due to a substantial decline in the market value of umc s stock price from june   the continued decline in stock prices of publicly traded semiconductor companies and the continuing unfavorable outlook for the semiconductor industry  that the decline in the investment value in umc had become other than temporary 
accordingly  million  which represents the difference between the carrying value on march  and the quoted fair value on september   was written off against earnings as an impairment loss on investments in accordance with statements of financial accounting sfas no 
and accounting principles board opinion apb no 
see part ii  item  notes and above investment in umc and comprehensive income loss  respectively for discussion of this investment 
during fiscal year the company sold million shares of its investment in umc for cash of million 
this resulted in a gain of million 
we may sell additional umc shares in the near future if we believe it is in the best interests of our stockholders to do so
