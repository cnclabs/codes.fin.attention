item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were established to continue to operate and expand the retail property business of our predecessor 
we commenced our operations in april our assets are held by  and all operations are conducted through  agree limited partnership the operating partnership  of which agree realty corporation is the sole general partner and held a interest as of december  we are operating so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
on august   we completed an offering of  shares of common stock at per share  on august  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares at the same per share price collectively  the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we have fourteen leases with kmart corporation 
eleven of the kmart stores are currently anchors in our community shopping centers and three kmart stores are freestanding net leased properties 
the kmart stores in our portfolio provided of our annual base rent as of december  four of the kmart stores paid percentage rent in addition to their minimum rent during as of december   all of our kmart stores were open and operating as kmart discount stores 
in may kmart emerged from the bankruptcy proceeding which it had initiated in january pursuant to the confirmed plan of reorganization  kmart closed approximately of its stores  including one located in our center in lakeland  florida 
kmart vacated the premises in lakeland  florida in april  and we are actively 
table of contents marketing the space formerly occupied by kmart 
kmart s annual rent on this property was approximately  and their annual contribution under the lease for real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance was approximately  certain tenants in the lakeland  florida community shopping center have co tenancy clauses in their leases which provide either for modification of their rent to be based on gross sales or an option to terminate their lease when the kmart store closed  and we are unable to obtain a replacement anchor tenant 
as of february   none of these tenants has indicated that they will exercise their option to terminate their leases with us 
we believe it will take between and months to re let the kmart location 
in connection with the re letting the kmart location  we may have to agree to make capital expenditures with respect to the property 
in addition  we have agreed to a rent reduction of  per year under a kmart lease for a store in perrysburg  ohio 
the rent reduction is for a year period 
during we sold a community shopping center that was located in winter garden  florida and was anchored by kmart 
the company developed the  square foot shopping center in the property was sold to a private investor for approximately million

the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of agree realty corporation  including the respective notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the objective of sfas is to establish standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in november  the fasb indefinitely delayed the effective date for certain mandatory redeemable non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
critical accounting policies in the course of developing and evaluating accounting policies and procedures  we use estimates  assumptions and judgments to determine the most appropriate methods to be applied 
such processes are used in determining capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 

table of contents in determining the fair value of real estate investments  we consider future cash flow projections on a property by property basis  current interest rates and current market conditions of the geographical location of each property 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our tax year 
as a result  we are not subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute annually at lease of our taxable income to our shareholders and satisfy certain other requirements defined in the code 
accordingly  no provision was made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance 
we also 
table of contents consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of our real estate between periods or compare such performance to that of different companies 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo in making our calculation  our method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and accordingly may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and year ended december  net income depreciation of real estate assets amortization of leasing costs minority interest gain on sale of assets funds from operations weighted average shares and op units outstanding liquidity and capital resources our principal demands for liquidity are distributions to our shareholders  debt service  development of new properties and future property acquisitions 
during the quarter ended december   we declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share 
the dividend was paid on january  to holders of record on december  as of december   we had total mortgage indebtedness of  with a weighted average interest rate of 
future scheduled annual maturities of mortgages payable for the years ending december are as follows      the mortgage debt is all fixed rate  self amortizing debt 
in addition  the operating partnership has in place a million credit facility with standard federal bank  as the agent credit facility  which is guaranteed by the company 
the credit facility matures in november and can be extended for an additional three years 
during the three year extension period we will have no further ability to borrow under this facility and will be required to repay a portion of the unpaid principal on a quarterly basis 
advances under 
table of contents the credit facility bear interest within a range of one month to six month libor plus basis points to basis points or the lender s prime rate  at the our option  based on certain factors such as debt to property value and debt service coverage 
the credit facility is used to fund property acquisitions and development activities and is secured by most of the properties which are not otherwise encumbered and properties to be acquired or developed 
as of december    was outstanding under the credit facility bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we also have in place a million line of credit line of credit  which matures on april   and which we expect to renew for an additional month period 
the line of credit bears interest at the lender s prime rate less basis points or basis points in excess of the one month libor rate  at our option 
the purpose of the line of credit is to provide working capital and fund land options and start up costs associated with new projects 
as of december    was outstanding under the line of credit bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we have received funding from an unaffiliated third party for the construction of one of our properties 
advances under this arrangement bear no interest 
the advances are secured by the specific land and buildings being developed 
as of december    was outstanding under this arrangement 
the following table outlines our contractual obligations in thousands as of december  total yr yrs yrs over yrs mortgages payable construction loan notes payable land lease obligations other long term liabilities total during the third quarter  we negotiated an early payment on three mortgage notes totaling approximately million and bearing an interest rate of 
the mortgages were secured by eight community shopping centers 
two of the mortgages totaling approximately million were scheduled to mature in november  and required a final payment in the amount of approximately million on the maturity date 
the third mortgage in the amount of approximately million had a scheduled maturity date of april and required a final payment in the amount of approximately million on the maturity date 
this mortgage contained a provision that would reset the interest rate to the then current rate in december we incurred a pre payment penalty of on the outstanding mortgage balance 
we have one development project under construction that will add an additional  square feet of gla to our portfolio 
the project was completed during the first quarter of additional funding required for this project is estimated to be  and will come from the credit facility 
we intend to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the leasing and improvement of the properties  through cash flow provided by operations and the line of 
table of contents credit 
we also have restricted cash available to fund future real estate investments 
we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
we intend to incur additional debt in a manner consistent with our policy of maintaining a ratio of total debt including construction and acquisition financing to total market capitalization of or less 
we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
we plan to begin construction of additional pre leased developments and may acquire additional properties  which will initially be financed by the credit facility and line of credit 
we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt and or equity 
upon completion of refinancing  we intend to lower the ratio of total debt to market capitalization to or less 
nevertheless  we may operate with debt levels or rations  which are in excess of for extended periods of time prior to such refinancing 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
item a quantitative and qualatative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on remaining debt  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate construction loans average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at   and  for fixed rate debt  construction loans and variable rate debt  respectively 

table of contents the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or position  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
