overview during  we made a number of changes in our senior management team and board  including the appointment of graham smith as chief financial officer in march  the appointment of stephanie dimarco  who founded advent in  initially as interim chief executive officer and president in may and then as permanent chief executive officer and president in december john h 
scully was appointed to our board in october and subsequently appointed chairman in december since may  our priorities have been to scale our business to appropriate expense levels and to build a sound business plan based on our established core products  which will lead to sustainable growth and profitability 
this back to basics model is a significant change from our strategy in and  when we focused on growth by acquisition and broadening product and service offerings  many of which were outside of our core product or service offerings 
scaling our business to appropriate expense levels during  we have been restructuring our operations in order to bring costs more into line with estimated revenues 
we consolidated office space in the new york city area and closed offices in melbourne  australia  concord  california  and denver  colorado 
we have also relocated certain employees from three buildings in san francisco  california  to two buildings 
we reduced our workforce from on december  to on december  we lowered costs in our other recently acquired businesses we ceased investing in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements certain products for the institutional broker dealer market  we narrowed our customer focus and automated processes in outsourcing services  and we standardized on a single technology platform in our consolidated wealth reporting business 
further cost reduction measures were implemented across all functions 
consequently  quarterly operating expenses were reduced from a high in second quarter of million to million in the fourth quarter we generated net losses in each quarter of under applicable accounting principles  based on our history of consecutive losses since the second quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for our net deferred tax assets  and we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
accordingly  we recorded a provision for income taxes in of million 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction activities  we had million of positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of and had positive cash flow from operations of million for focus on core business in and  we acquired six new businesses rex partners  lp  npo solutions  managerlink 
com  kinexus  techfi  and outsource data management  llc 
in the same periods  we also acquired our scandinavian and greek distributors operations 
the result of this acquisition strategy was that management increasingly was focused on issues associated with integrating a broad set of new businesses which in turn distracted senior management s attention from advent s well established core business 
during this period  adverse economic conditions and potential new regulations affected our customers and prospects in the financial services sector 
these conditions resulted in longer and less predictable sales cycles and caused existing and potential clients to decrease or delay their purchases of our software and related products and services 
in response to these conditions  we are re focusing the company on our well established core business  by reducing expenditures in our recently acquired businesses  realigning our sales organization  changing the priorities of our product development organization  and taking a more disciplined approach to execution 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and restructuring expenses and related accruals 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from software licenses  development fees  maintenance  other recurring revenues  professional services and other revenues 
in addition  we earn commissions from customers who use our broker dealer  second street securities  to soft dollar the purchase of non advent product and services 
soft dollaring enables the customers to use the commissions earned on trades to pay all or part of the fees owed to us for non advent products or services 
the commission revenues earned from soft dollaring non advent products or services are recorded as other revenues in professional services and other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software license and development fees 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors  primarily advent europe holdings  our european distributor  are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment to the distributor s customer and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
while many of our arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions  certain complex deals may involve acceptance criteria 
if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  and other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside of the united states 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method  based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
we offer term licenses as an alternative to perpetual licenses and recognize revenue for term licenses ratably over the period of the contract term 
to date  revenue from term licenses has not been material 
however  we expect term licenses to increase as a proportion of total licenses in the future 
development fees are derived from contracts that we have entered into with other companies  including customers and development partners 
agreements for which we receive development fees generally provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to become part of our product offerings in the future 
revenues for license development projects are recognized primarily using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion 
if a customer chooses to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  the soft dollar arrangement does not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract 
the customer is required to pay the original fee within one year 
if insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year  the customer is still required to render payment within one year 
if the customer chooses to use a third party broker dealer  the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software license section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  on limited occasions allowed customers to return software and have recorded sales returns reserves as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we do have three situations where we provide a contractual limited right of return to end user customers only in shrink wrap license agreements for advent product  our microedge product and our npo product 
the shrink wrap license agreement for advent product provides for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the software 
the microedge software license agreements allow for a thirty day money back guarantee 
the npo license agreement allows for a seven day right of return 
we recognize revenue on delivery since the fee is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay  the risk of loss passes to the customer  and we have the ability to estimate returns 
our ability to estimate returns is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
we have recorded a sales returns reserve contra revenue account to account for these situations based on our historical experience 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are charged in the initial licensing year and for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
fair value for maintenance is based upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or  in limited cases  separate sales of renewals to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance ratably over the contract term 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur 
subscription based revenues and any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by us to other customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
our professional services and other revenue also include revenue from our semi annual user conferences 
we recognize revenue as these professional services are performed 
commission revenues received from soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to advent products and services are recorded as other revenues 
revenues for these soft dollar transactions are recognized on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant factors considered by management in assessing the need for a valuation allowance include the following our historical operating results  the length of time over which the differences will be realized  tax planning opportunities  and expectations for future earnings 
in considering whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets  recent losses must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  based on our history of consecutive losses since the second quarter of  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
income 
table of contents 
index to financial statements tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable  or at least once a year 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of our annual impairment test  we completed the first step which did not indicate impairment 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative market or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we hold minority interests in several privately held companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
most of these investments can be considered in the start up or developing stages and are classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
one of these investments is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
our portion of net income and losses for this investment has not been significant to date 
we record an investment write down when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we estimate an investment s carrying value based primarily on its revenue and implied valuation based on revenue multiples for similar public companies  supplemented by any recent valuation events  such as an equity financing 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
during  we developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
acquisitions in may  we purchased all of the common stock of advent netherlands bv from our independent european distributor  advent europe  for cash consideration of million and  in acquisition costs 
there is also a potential earn out distribution to the selling members of up to million through december  under a formula based on revenue results for the eight months ended december  plus of any operating margins which exceed for the year ending december  the earn out distribution will be allocated to goodwill  if earned 
through december   no additional consideration had been earned or paid 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly  the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition 
the amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon management s estimates using established valuation techniques 
the results of operations of advent netherlands bv were included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 
the allocation of the advent netherlands bv purchase price was as follows estimated remaining useful life purchase price allocation in thousands goodwill customer relationships years sub licensing agreement years  non compete agreements year tangible assets current liabilities deferred tax liabilities total purchase price in  we acquired kinexus corporation  techfi corporation  advent hellas  and advent outsource data management  llc for a total purchase price of million

distributor relationship we rely on a number of alliances to help us achieve market acceptance of our products and to leverage our development  sales  and marketing resources 
in we established one such relationship with a company in scandinavia to distribute our products throughout scandinavia 
in the third quarter of  this distributor formed advent europe 
advent europe and its subsidiaries have the exclusive right to distribute our software 
table of contents 
index to financial statements products  excluding geneva  in certain locations in europe and the middle east 
this right expires on a territory specific basis  the earliest of which is july  and the latest is october   subject to achieving certain revenue levels 
incorporated in the netherlands  advent europe is an independent entity and is not financially backed by us and is entirely capitalized by independent third party investors 
it makes tax and language modifications to our software products to fit the various needs of the local jurisdictions and then markets and licenses the products and related services 
all transactions between advent europe and us are at arms length 
our revenues from this distributor in each of the three years ended december   and were less than of our total net revenue 
through october   advent europe has the contingent put right to require us to purchase any one or any group of its subsidiaries 
our requirement to purchase is contingent upon the distributor achieving specified operating margins in excess of and specified customer satisfaction criteria 
the purchase price is equal to two times the preceding twelve months total revenue of the purchased subsidiary  plus potential additional consideration equal to of operating margins that exceed  achieved in the two years subsequent to the acquisition 
this purchase price may be varied by mutual agreement 
in addition  we have the call right to purchase any one or any group of advent europe s subsidiaries under certain conditions 
in the event these rights are exercised by us or advent europe  the purchase of these subsidiaries would principally result in an increase in intangible assets  goodwill and amortization of intangible assets 
in march  our board approved a letter of intent to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets of advent europe for approximately million in cash with additional potential consideration of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
common stock repurchases in the first quarter of  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
in may and june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  and  shares  respectively 
during  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for which we paid million at an average price of per share 
in september and october we repurchased and retired  shares of our own common stock under a program approved by our board of directors in march to repurchase up to  shares from time to time 
we paid million at an average price of per share 
we periodically consider whether to repurchase shares of our common stock 
however  we do not expect to repurchase shares of our common stock in the first quarter of employee stock option exchange program in november  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program made available to certain eligible employees of the company 
the chairman of the board  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technology officer and executive vice president of corporate development were specifically excluded from participating in the exchange program 
under this program  eligible employees were given the option to cancel each outstanding stock option granted to them at an exercise price greater than or equal to per share  in exchange for a new option to buy shares of the company s common stock to be granted on june   six months and one day from december   the expiration date of the offer  and the date the old options of the participating employees were cancelled 
additionally  options granted in the six months prior to this exchange offer  irrespective of their exercise prices  were cancelled for all employees who elected to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements participate in the exchange program 
there was no credit given for option vesting during the period between cancellation of the outstanding option and the grant of the new option 
the exercise price of the new options is  equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
in total   option shares were eligible to participate in this program and  options were surrendered for cancellation ranging in exercise price from to with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the exchange program did not result in additional compensation charges 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts  as detailed below  have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation to better reflect our view of the current business 
these reclassifications do not affect total net revenues  net income or loss cash flows  or stockholders equity 
revenues 
we had previously classified all soft dollar fees from our broker dealer subsidiary as license and development fees 
these soft dollar fees reflect transactions relating to licenses of advent s products and services as well as soft dollar fees relating to third party products and services 
because soft dollar fees from third party products and services have been increasing as a percentage of total soft dollar fees  and license and development revenues have declined from previous levels  we believe it is more appropriate to exclude soft dollar fees related to third party products and services from license and development fees revenue  and we began presenting these amounts as professional services and other revenue 
the amounts reclassified were million and million for and  respectively 
soft dollar revenues relating to advent products and services remain in license and development fees revenue and accounted for less than of total license and development fees revenue for all periods presented 
revenue from our project management team had previously been classified in maintenance and other recurring revenue 
we have determined this revenue is better classified as professional services revenue  because the project management and consulting teams often work closely together and the nature of the projects is now typically non recurring 
the amounts reclassified were million and million for and  respectively 
expenses 
we reclassified the expenses relating to soft dollar fees for third party products from cost of license to cost of professional services and other 
in addition  other reclassifications were made to cost of revenues and operating expenses 
in the past  employees in product development  maintenance and professional services were typically called on to assist in the sales process 
as a result  a certain proportion of these expenses were allocated to sales and marketing 
as our organizational structure matured  the functional groups became more distinct 
our current view of the business is based on a stricter delineation between the functional groups 
overall  cost of revenues increased and operating expenses decreased as a result of these reclassifications by million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to our revenue and expense reclassifications described above  reclassifications were also made on our balance sheets and statements of cash flows 
amortization of developed technology 
in the fourth quarter of  we began presenting amortization of developed technology within cost of revenues 
through our various acquisitions  we have purchased technologies which are either licensed directly to our customers or used internally to provide services to our customers for which we derive revenue 
as a result of our acquisitions from through the middle of  the amortization related to purchased technology has increased 
we believe that presenting this amortization within cost of revenues more accurately presents our total cost of revenues and gross margin 
we have reclassified million and million for and  respectively  which were previously included in amortization of other intangibles within operating expenses  to amortization of developed technology within cost of revenues

maintenance and other recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year  renewals of annual maintenance services in subsequent years and recurring revenues derived from our subscription based and transaction based services 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services  soft dollaring of third party products and services and our user conferences 

table of contents 
index to financial statements net revenues in continued to be impacted by adverse economic conditions  resulting in reduced information technology spending by some of our customers and reduced demand for many of our products and services 
the decrease in net revenues in reflected declines in license and development fees and professional services and other  respectively  partially offset by an increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues  as well as increased revenue from international sales 
net revenues in also declined due to adverse economic conditions and the significant downturn in the financial markets  resulting in reduced spending by our customers and delayed purchases of our products 
in  license and development fees declined significantly  partially offset by a strong increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues as well as a slight increase in professional services and other 
the same economic factors impacted revenues across the industry in these two years  resulting in longer sales cycles  deferral and delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software related services 
during the second half of  the trend in spending by our customers began to stabilize and we experienced higher levels of revenues 
going forward  we expect normal seasonal weakness to result in lower revenues in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  followed by some stabilization and growth as the year progresses 
however  we continue to expect a difficult business environment and limited visibility 
international sales represented of our net revenues in  compared to less than in and the revenues from customers in any single country did not exceed of total revenues 
each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage of net revenues and we expect this variability to continue in future periods 
this variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of new products  the relative size and timing of individual licenses  as well as the size of the implementation  the resulting proportion of the maintenance and professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of client use of pricing and related data 
license revenue and development fees in thousands  except percentages license and development fees percentage of net revenues change over prior year percentage change over prior year the decline in license and development fees revenue in primarily reflected the continuing adverse economic and industry conditions resulting in reduced capital spending by some of our customers 
the decrease primarily reflected lower license fees from certain strategic relationships and lower revenues from sales of axys  partner  moxy  qube  and other associated products  particularly with larger customers 
the decline in primarily reflected adverse economic conditions and economic uncertainty 
the corresponding downturn in financial markets resulted in some of our customers reducing and postponing orders 
the decrease in license and development fees revenue in was due primarily to decreased sales of geneva and the advent office suite of products 
these declines in revenues in and reflected a decline in both size and volume of our software sales 
the reluctance of some of our customers to commit to new software purchases also resulted in the significant decline in license and development fees revenue as a percentage of net revenues in and license and development fees revenue stabilized and then increased in the second half of we expect seasonal weakness to impact license and development fees revenue in the first quarter of we expect license and development fees revenues to increase moderately for the full year 
for each of the periods presented  the advent office suite of products  including axys  moxy  partner and qube  accounted for the majority of license revenue 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the number of site installations  the number of authorized users and the customer s line of business 
our pricing can vary in different market segments to maintain our competitive position 
we earn development fees when we provide product solutions that are not part of our standard product

the increase in was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and increased revenue from our advent custodial data services as well as our other data feed revenue sources 
revenue associated with our acquisitions of kinexus in february  techfi in july and advent outsource in november and increased demand for pricing data and other data services associated with our wealth management solutions also contributed to increased maintenance and other recurring revenues in we expect that maintenance and recurring revenues will be reasonably flat in the first quarter of  with slight increases each quarter for the remainder of professional services and other revenues in thousands  except percentages professional services and other percent of net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year the decline in professional services and other revenues in partially reflected lower consulting revenues as a result of lower new license sales  reduced demand for our other professional services such as training and custom work  as well as a decline in revenues earned from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions 
our consulting revenues are generally proportional to sales of our software products  which declined in the increase in professional services and other revenue in was primarily due to higher revenues earned from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions  partially offset by a decrease in general consulting revenues as a result of the decrease in license revenues

the decrease in expenses in was due primarily to lower headcount as a result of our restructuring activities implemented during  and to a lesser extent  a decline in strategic marketing programs 
the increase in expense in was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel primarily related to our acquisitions of kinexus  techfi  advent outsource and advent hellas  and increased marketing programs targeting our core markets and our wealth management initiatives such as advent wealth service and wealthline

the decrease in expenses in was due primarily to a decline in headcount as a result of our restructuring activities and lower costs for contractors 
the increase in expenses in was due primarily to growth in personnel as we increased our product development efforts to accelerate the rate of product enhancements and new product introductions  such as geneva  and our wealth management initiatives related to advent wealth service and wealthline in connection with our acquisitions of kinexus and techfi

the increase in was due to increased personnel hired early in the year in expectation of continued growth of the business  an increase in personnel related to the acquisitions of kinexus and techfi and an increase in legal fees due to certain litigation matters

we expect amortization of other intangibles to be approximately million in purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development ipr d of million was incurred in the third quarter of in conjunction with our acquisition of techfi 
this amount represented the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimated projected revenue and expenses beyond and expected industry benchmarks 
revenue estimates also included an estimated annual attrition percentage to

estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at after tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses included costs of goods sold  research and development  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  including estimated costs to maintain the products once they had been introduced into the market and were generating revenue 
the rates utilized to discount projected cash flows were to for in process technologies and were based primarily on rates of return and the overall level of market acceptance and the amount of time each respective technology had been in the marketplace 
the project was completed in within the budgeted guidelines 
restructuring charges in response to the downturn in the financial services industry  the decline in information technology spending and duplicative efforts in parts of our business as a result of various acquisitions  we implemented several phases of restructuring during these plans were implemented to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies by better aligning our resources to our near term revenue opportunities 
for the year ended december   we recorded total restructuring charges of million consisting of million for severance and benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees  million for costs to exit leased facilities  and million for the write off of property and equipment 
the workforce reduction of employees consisted of employees in client services and support  employees in professional services  employees in product development  employees in sales and marketing and employees in general and administrative functions 
these employees were located in san francisco  california  new york  new york  denver  colorado  concord  california  and melbourne  australia 
included in the charge is  for non cash severance associated with modification to a former employee s stock options 
the company also incurred charges associated with consolidating office space in the new york city area and vacating facilities in melbourne  australia  concord  california  and denver  colorado 
the company estimated the cost of exiting and terminating the facility leases based on the contractual terms of the agreements and real estate market conditions 
amounts related to the lease expense  net of anticipated sublease proceeds  will be paid over the respective lease terms through the write off of property and equipment consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  and office equipment  furniture and fixtures which were abandoned as a result of vacating various facilities 
as of december  the remaining excess facility costs of million are stated at estimated fair value  net of estimated sublease income of million 
we expect to pay the remaining obligations in connection with vacated facilities over the remaining lease terms  which will expire on various dates through we expect to pay the remaining severance and benefits of  in the first two quarters of as a result of our restructuring activities implemented during  we have reduced our total expenses by approximately million on an annual basis 
in  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately million to million as we identify opportunities to further reduce costs  particularly those associated with our real estate leases 
interest income and other expense  net interest income and other expense  net consists of interest income  realized gains and losses on short term investments and foreign currency gains and losses 
interest income and other expense  net was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the decreases in interest income and other expense  net for and reflected lower average cash and short term investment balances and lower average interest rates 
loss on investments loss on investments includes other than temporary losses on our investments in privately held companies 
we recorded write downs of million  million and million in  and  respectively  on these investments 
the loss on investments in consisted primarily of a write off

provision for income taxes during  we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united states because we determined it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the provision for income taxes was million in as compared to a benefit from income taxes of million in and a provision for income taxes of million in  with an effective tax rate of provision in  benefit in  and provision in as of december   we made no provision for a cumulative total of million of undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries  which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested

operating activities provided million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash provided by operating activities has followed the trend in our net revenues  declining in each of the past two years 
our net loss in was significantly offset by non cash charges  while our net loss in was more than offset by these charges 
non cash charges include deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  other than temporary losses from investments  and non cash restructuring charges 
collections on our accounts receivable represent the major source of our operating cash 
our accounts receivable balance decreased million and million in and  respectively  representing lower levels of revenue and improved collection efforts 
accounts receivable increased million in representing increased revenue compared with the prior year 
the major use of our operating cash is to fund obligations which flow through our accounts payable and accrued liabilities  such as funding of payroll and related benefits  rent  facilities costs  insurance  professional fees and other costs incurred in our normal operations 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  collection of accounts receivable  and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in of million consisted of net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  partially offset by million used for the acquisition of advent netherlands bv and purchases of property and equipment of million

table of contents 
index to financial statements in march  our board approved a letter of intent to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets of our independent european distributor  advent europe  for approximately million in cash with additional potential consideration of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
going forward  we may consider acquiring additional businesses from time to time 
we do not expect a significant change in our expenditures for property and equipment in cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities in of million reflected the repurchase of one million shares of our common stock for million and principal payments on capital leases of million  partially offset by stock issued through employee stock purchase and stock option plans of million 
net cash used in financing activities in of million reflected the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million and principal payments on capital leases of million  partially offset by stock issued through employee stock purchase and stock option plans of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million reflected net proceeds from a secondary offering of our common stock of million  stock issued through employee stock purchase and stock option plans of million and proceeds from the issuance of warrants of million  partially offset by the repurchase of our common stock of million 
we periodically consider whether to repurchase shares of our common stock 
however  we do not expect to repurchase shares of our common stock during the first quarter of at december   we had million in working capital  down from million at december  we currently have no significant capital commitments other than commitments under our operating leases  which declined from million at december  to million at december   as a result of exiting various facilities as part of our restructuring activities 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and thereafter total in thousands operating lease obligations at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we have taken numerous actions over the last year to strengthen our cash position and balance sheet and to improve our ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities 
many of these actions were taken in in the last half of in order to offset the negative impacts of the economic downturn and decreased information technology spending which negatively impacted our net revenues 
based upon our past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and financing activities for at least the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncement in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company 
table of contents 
index to financial statements should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes where a the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or b the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both primary beneficiary 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after january  we continue to evaluate the provisions of fin with respect to our independent european distributor to determine whether this distributor is a variable interest entity and  if so  if we are the primary beneficiary 
it is reasonably possible that we would have to consolidate this distributor  but we do not believe it will have a material impact on our financial results 
risk factors and other trends and uncertainties affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
licenses into multi user networked environments have varied both in individual size and number  and the timing and size of individual license transactions are important factors in quarterly operating results 
the sales and contracting cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
we may not be successful in closing large license transactions such as these on a timely basis or at all 
accordingly  because revenues from large licenses may vary as a portion of our net revenues  the timing of such licenses causes additional variability in our quarterly operating results 
software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents an immaterial portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved on products  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
we have often recognized a substantial portion of each quarter s license revenues in the last month  weeks or even days of the quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in revenue or earnings may not be evident until late in or after the close of a particular quarter and a disruption late in the quarter may have a disproportionately large negative impact on our quarterly results 
these factors have impacted and may continue to impact our results 
in addition  we experience seasonality in our license revenue 
the fourth quarter of the year typically has the highest license revenue  followed by lower revenue in the first quarter of the succeeding year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from customer budgeting cycles 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
because of the above factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our sales cycle is long and we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
the purchase of our software products often requires prospective customers to provide significant executive level sponsorship and to make major systems architecture decisions 
as a result  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales and contracting effort 
sales transactions may therefore be delayed during the customer decision process because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefit of our products 
this has been exacerbated by the adverse economic conditions that are causing existing and potential clients to reduce or cancel expenditures and delay decisions related to acquisition of software and related services 
as a result  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our solution is typically between two and twelve months depending upon the size of the client  and is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgeting constraints  internal selection procedures  and changes in customer personnel  among others 
as a result of a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific license sales 
the timing of large individual license sales is especially difficult to forecast  and we may not be successful in closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  customers may postpone their purchases of our existing products or product enhancements in advance of the anticipated introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in a significant variation in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we depend upon financial markets 
the target clients for our products include a range of financial services organizations that manage investment portfolios  including asset managers  investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks  family offices  hedge funds and others 
in addition  we target corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations  which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
we believe that demand for our solutions has been  and could continue to be  disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial services industry which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
also  recent investigative efforts into various mutual fund industry practices could impact our business if that industry experiences a decline in its business 
in addition  a slowdown in the formation of new investment firms or a decline in the growth of assets under management would cause a decline in demand for our solutions 
we believe that the downturn in the financial services industry and the decline in information technology spending continued to negatively impact the demand for our products in the past two years  and that continuing uncertainty about financial markets and the financial services sector could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend heavily on our product  axys 
historically  we have derived a majority of our net revenues from the licensing of axys  and related ancillary products and services 
in addition  many of our other applications  such as partner  moxy  qube and various data interfaces were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  we believe that for the foreseeable future a majority of our net revenues will depend upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
as our clients include a range of organizations  including asset managers  investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks  family offices  hedge funds and others  the degree of continued market acceptance will also depend on the number of firms within each type of organization and the degree to which axys previously penetrated those firms 
adverse economic conditions may reduce our revenues 
we believe that the market for large investment management software systems may be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including reductions in capital expenditures by large customers  poor performance of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements major financial markets  and increasing competition 
those factors may  in turn  give rise to a number of market trends which we have experienced in the past two years that have slowed revenue growth across the industry  including longer sales and contracting cycles  deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software and related services 
if the downturn in the financial services industry and information technology spending continues  the presence of these factors in the market for large investment management solutions will likely materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we face intense competition 
the market for investment management software is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  is subject to rapid change and is sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
our largest single source of competition is from proprietary systems used by existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors like advent 
other competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of outsourced services  and include some of the following vendors beauchamp  charles river development  checkfree corporation  divisions of sunguard  eagle  a subsidiary of mellon financial corporation  eze castle software  financial models company  inc  ft integretorsia  indata  linedata  macgregor financial technologies  schwab performance technologies  ss c technologies  inc  and the portia division of thomson financial 
our competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  we also face competition from potential new entrants into our market that may develop innovative technologies or business models 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins or loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices 
we may not be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  or at all  and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including certain system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  database vendors and development tool vendors 
if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws  are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  or are unavailable on acceptable terms  our business could be seriously harmed 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although we have not experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors  we cannot be sure that  despite testing by us and our clients  defects or errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we must retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management and other key personnel 
additionally  our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  backgrounds and industry experience 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we may also be required to create additional performance and retention incentives in order to retain our employees  including the granting of additional stock options to employees at current prices or issuing incentive cash bonuses 
such incentives may either dilute our existing stockholder base or result in unforeseen operating expenses  which may cause our stock price to fall 
difficulties in integrating our acquisitions have impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and we face risks associated with potential acquisitions  investments or divestitures 
in may of we purchased our dutch distributor  advent netherlands bv 
in  we completed the acquisition of kinexus corporation  techfi corporation  advent outsource data management  llc and our greek distributor advent hellas 
in  we acquired rex development partners  lp  npo solutions  inc  and our scandinavian distributor s operations in norway  sweden and denmark 
the complex process of integrating our acquisitions has required and will continue to require significant resources  particularly in light of our relative inexperience in integrating acquisitions 
integrating these acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
this integration process has strained our managerial resources  and has resulted in the diversion of these resources from our core business objectives 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of these entities has harmed and could continue to harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant challenges expected synergy benefits from these acquisitions  such as lower costs or increased revenues  may not be realized or may be realized more slowly than anticipated  particularly with regard to costs associated with reductions in headcount and facilities  potentially incompatible cultural differences between the companies  incorporating these companies technologies and products into our current and future product lines  geographic dispersion of operations and the complexities of international operations  integrating the technical teams of these companies with our engineering organizations  generating market demand for an expanded product line  integrating the products of these companies with our business  because we do not have distribution  manufacturing  marketing or support experience for these products  the difficulty of leveraging our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and our inability to retain significant customers or key employees of these entities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and commit significant management time in integrating the operations  technology  development programs  products  administrative and information systems  customers and personnel of these acquisitions 
these costs have been and will likely continue to be substantial and include costs for integrating and reorganizing operations  including combining teams  facilities and processes in various functional areas  identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities  developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing those plans  fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing the integration process  settling existing liabilities of these companies  uncovering through our audit process new issues reflected on the companies financial statements  vacating  subleasing and closing facilities  employee relocation  redeployment or severance costs  discontinuing certain products and services  integrating technology and products  and other transaction costs associated with the acquisition  including financial advisor  attorney  accountant and exchange agent fees 
we may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies in the future 
in addition  we continually evaluate the performance of all our products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or product lines 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition or divestiture could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt  write off investments  infrastructure costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  write off impaired goodwill or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders ownership 
finally  we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions 
difficulties we may encounter managing changes in the size of our business could adversely affect our operating results 
our business has experienced years of rapid growth through both internal expansion and acquisitions  followed by reduced revenues in and  and significant downsizing during these changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
during the past year  we took steps to better align our resources with our operating requirements in order to increase our efficiency 
through these steps  we reduced our headcount  closed selected offices and incurred charges for employee severance and excess facilities capacity 
while we believe that these steps help us achieve greater operating efficiency  we have limited history with such measures and the results of these measures are less than predictable 
additional restructuring efforts may be required 
to manage our business effectively  we must continue to improve our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing headcount  capital and processes in an efficient manner 
our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization 
we believe workforce reductions  management changes and facility consolidation create anxiety and uncertainty and may adversely affect employee morale 
these measures could adversely affect our employees that we wish to retain and may also adversely affect our ability to hire new personnel 
they may also affect customers 
in addition  our revenues may not grow in alignment with our headcount 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we face risks related to our new business areas 
during and we expanded into a number of new business areas  for example international operations  strategic alliances  acquisitions such as advent wealth service  techfi and advent backoffice and offerings such as wealthline 
these areas are still relatively new to our product development and sales personnel 
some of these new business areas have required significant management time and resources without generating significant revenues  and have diverted and may continue to divert management from our core business 
while our traditional offerings are marketed to investment managers and advisors  advent wealth service and wealthline are also targeted for use by our clients customers 
we have had difficulty and may continue to have difficulty creating demand from our client s customers as we market to them indirectly  through our clients 
revenue growth has suffered and may continue to suffer if we cannot create demand among our clients customers 
we face challenges in expanding our international operations 
we market and sell our products in the united states and  to a lesser extent  internationally 
in  we entered into a distributor relationship with advent europe  an independent distributor of our products in selected european markets 
in november  we acquired the norwegian  swedish  and danish companies of this independent distributor  in september  we purchased their greek subsidiary and in may  we purchased their dutch subsidiary 
if we further expand our international operations  we would need to establish additional locations  acquire other businesses or enter into additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world 
any further expansion of our existing international operations and entry into new international markets could require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that establishing businesses in other countries will produce the desired levels of revenues 
we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language  regulatory and technology standards of other countries  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local currencies 
we have not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential foreign currency exposure 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect revenues and accounts receivable from international sales and the us dollar value of our foreign subsidiaries revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
our international revenues from our distributors are generally denominated in local foreign currencies with the exception of our geneva license transactions 
writing off investments could harm our results of operations 
we have made investments in privately held companies  which we classify as other assets on our balance sheet 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements these companies  the overall health of these companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
due to these and other factors  we have previously determined  and may in the future determine  that the value of these investments is impaired  which has caused and would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments such as the write off of our investments in encompys and mycfo during furthermore  we cannot be sure that future investment  license  fixed asset or other asset write downs will not happen  particularly if the downturn in the financial services industry and the decline in information technology spending continues 
if future write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
information we provide to investors is accurate only as of the date we disseminate it 
from time to time  we may publicly disseminate forward looking information or guidance in compliance with regulation fd 
this information or guidance represents our outlook only as of the date we disseminate it  and we do not undertake to update such information or guidance 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly 
like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly during times of high market volatility 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  our stock price is likely to decline 
in addition  our stock price is affected by trends in the financial services sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
if our relationship with interactive data corporation is terminated  our business may be harmed 
many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from interactive data corporation idc 
idc pays us a commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients 
our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason 
termination of our agreement with idc would require at least two years notice by either us or them  or days in the case of material breach 
our revenue could be adversely impacted if our relationship with idc were terminated or their services were unavailable to our clients for any reason 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could seriously harm our business 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers and customers 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite these efforts  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
we do not have any patents  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  we cannot be certain that others will not develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology  or that equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products  thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent  if issued  would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this litigation may be time consuming and expensive 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect

index to financial statements proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot be sure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we may incur additional costs or be prevented from selling our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our products or services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
as a result  we may be subject to litigation and claims  including claims of infringement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties that would be time consuming and costly to resolve 
if we discovered that our products or services violated the intellectual property rights of third parties  we would have to make substantial changes to our products or services or obtain licenses from such third parties 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on favorable terms or at all  and we may be unable to change our products successfully or in a timely manner 
failure to resolve an infringement matter successfully or in a timely manner  would force us to incur significant costs  including damages  redevelopment costs  diversion of management s attention and satisfaction of indemnification obligations that we have with our clients  as well as prevent us from selling certain products or services 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are exposed to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  and other events beyond our control 
additionally  we are vulnerable to interruption caused by political and terrorist incidents 
for example  our facilities in new york were temporarily closed due to the september  terrorist attacks 
immediately after the terrorist attacks  our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional software components  while the grounding of transportation impeded our ability to deliver professional services at client sites 
additionally  during the temporary closure of the us stock markets  our clients did not use our market data services 
such interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business and could seriously harm us 
further  such attacks could cause instability in the financial markets upon which we depend 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products that could seriously harm our business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures or scalability limitations at any point in the life of the product  but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or a delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  customer dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins  any of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in jurisdictions where we operate 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act the act of  which became law in july  requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and or compliance practices 
as part of the act s requirements  the securities and exchange commission has been promulgating new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to other rule proposals  and the nasdaq stock market has enacted new corporate governance listing requirements 
we believe these developments will increase our accounting and legal compliance costs and could also expose us to additional liability 
in addition  such developments may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or executive management more

we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory and legislative developments and cannot reliably estimate the timing or magnitude of additional cost we will incur as a result of the act or other related legislation or regulation 
if we account for employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans using the fair value method  it could adversely affect our results of operations 
there has been ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant accounting charges 
for example  in  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed in fasb statement no 
as amended by statement  our net loss would have increased by million 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value at the grant date and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as an expense using the fair value method 
security risks and concerns may deter the use of the internet for conducting business 
a significant barrier to commerce and communications over public networks is the secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary information 
if any well publicized compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the internet for commerce and communications 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or other third parties  which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
to the extent that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business would be harmed if our security were breached 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent hellas and advent netherlands  whose revenues  with the exception of geneva transactions and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
the results of operations from these territories are not material to our operating results  therefore  we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of december  an immediate sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  immediate sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures

index to financial statements by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and a majority of our investment portfolio at the end of and had maturities of less than one year 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of  and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december  we have also invested in several privately held companies  most of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
the value of these investments is also influenced by factors including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of the companies industries and the strength of the private equity markets 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
at december  our net investments in privately held companies totaled million
