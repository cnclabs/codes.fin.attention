competition the principal markets in which we compete are data protection  file system and volume management  clustering  replication  storage resource management  storage area network management  automated server provisioning  application performance management and centralized service level management 
these markets are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
our future anticipated growth and success will depend on our ability to develop superior products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than relying on alternative products and technologies and to develop additional channels to market 
many of our strategic partners  including emc corporation  hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft  oracle corporation and sun microsystems  offer software products that compete with our products or have announced their intention to focus on developing or acquiring their own storage and enterprise management software products 
while we may compete with these companies for a share of the market  some also resell our products  and in some cases incorporate our technology into their products or solutions 
we also may be involved with them in collaborative efforts to address interoperability issues and to set standards for evolving technology 
in addition  we compete with hardware and software vendors that offer data protection products  file system and volume management products  clustering and replication products  storage area networking management solutions  automated server provisioning solutions and centralized service level management products 
we compete with software vendors that offer application performance management solutions and systems management companies that are integrating storage resource management functions into their platforms 
some of our products also compete with enterprise management vendors  including bmc software  inc  computer associates international  inc  mercury interactive corporation and quest software  inc the principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality  product integration  platform coverage  price  ability to scale  worldwide sales and marketing infrastructure and global technical support 
although some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other 
table of contents resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  we believe we compete favorably on the basis of each of these competitive factors relative to our competitors 
we believe that our unique position as an independent software provider  strategy for utility computing infrastructure  hardware independent solutions and proven data protection and storage software market leadership  give us an advantaged position in the market 
our future anticipated growth and success will depend on our ability to continue to develop products more rapidly than and superior to those of our competitors  educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than purchasing or using competing technologies and develop additional channels to market 
our future and existing competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products  and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products to compete with our products 
our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors 
finally  because new distribution methods offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by start up companies in the software industry  we may face additional competition from these companies in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license orders are generally higher in our fourth fiscal quarter and lower in our first fiscal quarter  with a significant decline in license orders in the first quarter of a fiscal year when compared to license orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
software license revenues generally reflect similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than license orders because not all orders received during a quarter are shipped during that quarter  and license revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
unfilled license orders and deferred revenue at the end of any quarter  we typically have unfilled license orders 
because we generally ship our software products within days after acceptance of customer orders and revenues in a given quarter are generally dependent upon the amount of customer orders received during such quarter  we do not believe that unfilled license orders are a consistent or reliable indicator of future results 
unfilled license orders represent cancelable and non cancelable license orders that have been received from our customers for the license of our software products but have not been shipped as of the end of the applicable fiscal period 
our customers generally do not cancel orders for our software products 
unfilled license orders  which represent an unaudited operating measure  were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
deferred license revenue represents license orders for our software products that have been billed to and paid by the customer and for which revenue has not yet been earned  but is generally earned within the next year 
deferred license revenue was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our unfilled license orders and quarterly license revenue will vary  depending primarily on the amount and timing of orders received and orders shipped 
for additional information regarding factors that affect the timing of the recognition of software license revenue  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition delivery of software products 
total deferred revenue includes  in addition to deferred license revenue described above  deferred services revenue related to maintenance and technical support contracts and professional services training and 
table of contents consulting contracts 
deferred service revenue  which in the case of maintenance and technical support is generally recognized over the maintenance and support period of twelve months  or in the case of professional services  training or consulting services is generally recognized over the period the specific services are rendered  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
research and development our research and development efforts have been directed toward developing new products for unix  linux and windows  developing new features and functionality for existing products  integrating products across our existing product lines  porting new and existing products to different operating systems and expanding our product portfolio into new markets such as application performance management  server provisioning and centralized service level management 
our major research and development initiatives include continued focus on operating system platform expansion 
we have successfully ported the majority of our traditional storage software and enterprise data protection products to unix  windows and linux and are seeing increased acceptance of new platform offerings in the marketplace 
in particular  we are increasing our investment in products for servers based on intel architecture that we believe will be important to future data center architectures 
new utility computing infrastructure products  including server provisioning  clustering  application performance management and service level management 
our current product offerings contain many best of class products that serve as building blocks that enable customers to adopt a utility computing model 
these products are also unique in their level of heterogeneous platform  application and database support 
future investment is focused on both creating new best in class building blocks as we better understand customer utility computing requirements and increasingly integrating these components to provide solution suites that automate it processes  enable dynamic reconfiguration of the data centers and define  measure and enforce service level agreements 
replication  storage resource management embedded storage networking software and next generation virtualization technology 
during  we saw increased acceptance of our replication and storage resource management solutions 
our unique replication approach enables customers to implement data recovery solutions at a much lower cost than traditional array based approaches and we are increasingly integrating this function into our clustering and data protection technologies to simplify customer deployments 
our focus in storage resource management is to develop  acquire and integrate technology into a single suite for both storage area network management and business level reporting for data centers  and to increase distribution of low end solutions for high volume servers in medium sized businesses and remote offices 
we also have formal development partnerships with cisco systems  inc and brocade communications systems  inc 
in which we are embedding our industry leading volume management and replication software in their networking devices 
lastly  we are developing a new architecture for our volume manager that helps customers manage storage across a large number of servers 
new data protection technologies for disk based data protection  regulatory compliance and disaster recovery 
netbackup  released in the fourth quarter of  added significant new capabilities that enable customers to leverage increasingly inexpensive disk technology to protect their data as a complement to traditional tape based methodologies 
we also announced an archiving product in the fourth quarter of  the data lifecycle management option  that helps existing netbackup and backup exec customers comply with corporate governance and industry regulations for long term data retention and reporting 
the development for this product is complete and we commenced shipment of this product in the first quarter of both of these areas will continue to be priorities for new technology development and we will increasingly integrate these products and our storage management offerings into comprehensive solutions for data lifecycle management 

table of contents local language support 
we continue to focus on providing local language support for our traditional storage software and enterprise data protection products to increase the acceptance of these products in international markets 
we had research and development expenses  exclusive of in process research and development associated with acquisitions  of million in  million in and million in we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements and develop and introduce new products in a timely manner that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we continue to make substantial investments in new products  which may or may not be successful 
we may not complete these research and development efforts successfully and  therefore  future products may not be available on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance 
intellectual property rights protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that helps enable us to gain recognition for our products  services and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment and networks 
trademarks  patents and copyrights veritas and the veritas logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the united states and other countries 
in addition to veritas and the veritas logo  we have used  registered and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country and in the us  we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we generally take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and actively are enforcing such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may not be of commercial benefit to us or the validity of these rights may be challenged 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license or other intellectual property right 

table of contents employees as of december   we had  employees  including  employees in research and development   in sales  marketing  consulting  customer support and strategic initiatives and in general and administrative services 
we expect to hire additional employees in  particularly in research and development and in sales  marketing  consulting and customer support 
we have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements with our employees and believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon the continued service of our key employees and on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key employees and may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business in the future
