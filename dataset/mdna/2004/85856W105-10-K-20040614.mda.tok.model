item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general in  we launched one of the first software product suites on the market specifically developed and created for managing business information using the web 
from the beginning  stellent focused on developing software that could be quickly implemented  easily used and easily scaled from line of business to enterprise wide applications 
this focus remains true today 
while early on we developed document management and web content management applications  in recent years we also expanded our product set to address market needs for web based management of digital assets  which are digital materials such as photos and graphics  and business records 
the business information we manage for our customers is in an electronic form and is generally considered unstructured data  or data that is not easily managed by relational databases 
in fact  the vast majority of information in any business is considered to be unstructured information  and typically resides in areas such as personal computers  conventional file servers and paper documents 
in fiscal year  our universal content management software addressed primarily five areas of the enterprise content management market web content management  document management  collaboration  records management and digital asset management 
currently  customers use our universal content management software to organize and maintain the electronic business information created by internal and external sources using a broad range of common software applications  such as microsoft office  autodesk autocad and sun staroffice 
this electronic business information includes items such as web pages  digital assets  scanned images  microsoft word documents  spreadsheets and forms 
our software also assists in the conversion of paper documents to electronic format 
using stellent technology  customers can then publish that information to public web sites and or secure web sites available only to select audiences 
additionally  software vendors and manufacturers of electronic devices  such as cell phones and pdas  embed our content component software within their own technology to enable users to access and view electronic information from those applications or devices 
we market our products primarily to customers in the financial services  healthcare including insurance  government  and manufacturing industries located in the united states  canada  europe  latin america and asia 
our approach has been to develop our products internally and acquire select third party technologies that enhance our products capabilities 
this approach has resulted in an integrated solution that can be used for line of business applications or deployed on an enterprise wide basis by companies 
in may  we completed an acquisition in which we acquired all outstanding shares of optika inc for million in cash  approximately million shares of stellent common stock and the assumption by stellent of optika s outstanding common stock options 
we completed the acquisition of optika in order to strengthen and expand our universal content management software offerings in the areas of document imaging  business process management and compliance 
accordingly  our financial results in fiscal year will be difficult to compare to our fiscal year results 
additionally  in august  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of ancept  inc for approximately million in cash and  shares of stock valued at approximately million 
we acquired the ancept assets primarily to extend stellent s existing digital asset management capabilities  which are designed to acquire  index and keep track of digital material owned by an enterprise 
this digital material may include text  graphics  audio  video and animations 
the company is also required to make contingent 
table of contents payments based upon certain license revenue amounts for two years from the date of acquisition 
the company has recognized approximately million in revenue in fiscal year related to this acquisition 
market trends we have experienced a very difficult business environment beginning in the middle of our fiscal year during this period and through our fiscal year  there have been dramatic reductions in spending on information technology  both in the united states and internationally 
in our fiscal year  we derived approximately percent of our revenue from the united states market and approximately percent from various international markets  primarily europe 
while we believe the spending in information technology in the united states has been better than the international markets  we have also been expanding into the asian markets  particularly japan 
the percentage of revenue derived from asia remains small compared to the united states and europe 
this difficult business climate has shifted our revenue mix substantially over the past three years and our license revenue  as a percent of total revenue  has decreased from to to in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have seen customers downsize their information technology employees and they have consequently placed greater emphasis on using our consulting services group  or other third parties  to implement the software they have licensed from us 
this is reflected in our consulting services and training revenue  as a percent of total revenue  which has increased from to to in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect our customer base to continue to grow  and with it an increase in post contract support revenue 
this is reflected in our post contract support revenue  as a percent of total revenue  which has increased from to to in fiscal years  and  respectively 
with more of our revenues coming from services  our overall gross margins may decrease 
we believe that our license revenue in fiscal year  as a percent of total revenue  will decrease modestly from fiscal year as a result of these continued trends 
we believe stellent today can compete effectively in a rapidly evolving marketplace 
based on industry analysts opinions  our opinions  and current and prospective customers opinions regarding it investment priorities in the next several years  we believe the content management market is healthier than many other segments of the information technology sector and that it will perform better than the average information technology sector in customer spending during fiscal year we believe that the trend toward companies increasingly using the web for communicating and publishing business information will continue 
moreover  we believe that the trend toward more individuals creating more information that those companies will seek to organize  maintain and publish on public or private web sites will continue  portable electronic devices will be used increasingly to view electronic information and that software sales in the general information technology sector will improve modestly  which is important to us as our content component software is imbedded in both of these products  content within the enterprise will grow at an exponential rate 
according to the university of california berkeley school of information management and systems  the amount of new information stored on paper  film  optical and magnetic media has doubled in the last three years 
new information produced in those forms during  according to the research  was equal in size to half a million new libraries  each containing a digitized version of the print collections of the entire library of congress 
with the acquisition of ancept  we believe that we will be able to compete effectively in this area  which we believe will increase our license revenue  vendor consolidation will continue to be a driving force in technology buying decisions 
companies want to manage all of their business information using the fewest number of vendors possible and from ones that are financially viable 
and all sizes of organizations are looking for technology that delivers a broad set of robust content management solutions  without requiring them to invest millions of dollars building infrastructures that are difficult and expensive to maintain over time 
with the acquisition of 
table of contents optika  we believe that this will give us additional financial strength and increase profitability  and we now have a broader set of content management solutions that organizations are requesting  compliance mandates and records management initiatives are increasingly driving technology purchasing decisions  and influencing which vendors are selected to power information related initiatives 
in fact  forty percent of respondents to an informationweek survey said compliance has been a catalyst for change within their organization 
and according to gartner  ninety percent of public companies are still trying to put compliance efforts in place 
with our acquisition of optika  we believe that we are well positioned in this area to take advantage of this trend 
while we believe the general and long term market trends identified above will create continued demand for our products  the market for content management software and our products at any particular time is highly dependent on information technology spending 
weak united states and international economic conditions resulted in reduced information technology spending since the middle of fiscal year we cannot be certain whether  and if so  when  spending on information technology will rebound 
we believe continuing difficult economic and market conditions are putting pressure on the ability of certain content management software companies to survive as independent entities  if at all 
a consolidated content management software market may be inviting to larger software vendors that traditionally have marketed infrastructure  or business transaction processing  software 
if infrastructure software vendors  some of which have access to significantly greater financial and technical resources that we do  enter the content management software market  our business and operation results may be significantly adversely affected 
we cannot be certain whether infrastructure software vendors will enter the content management software market 
restructurings beginning in april and continuing through april  we implemented several cost cutting measures  including a reduction in work force of approximately since march  of employees to employees at march  these restructuring measures were in response to the economic slowdown both in the united states and internationally and were in all functional areas and geographies 
although we implemented the restructurings to reduce overall costs  we have recently been investing in certain areas in order to expand our customer base and grow our revenues 
because of this  we anticipate that the percentage of expenses as compared to total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses will fluctuate from period to period depending primarily on when we hire new personnel  the timing of certain sales and marketing programs  the research programs that we put in place and the potential expansion of operations 
in addition  our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to predict future operating results 
we cannot be certain that we will sustain revenue growth 
additional information on our restructuring plans is contained in footnote to the financial statements 
in connection with the integration of optika and in connection with our plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we adopted a restructuring plan on june  this restructuring plan includes the termination of employees and the closure of our new york facility 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of fiscal year related to this plan are expected to be approximately million to million 
we expect the restructuring to reduce our operating expenses and increase our cash flow by approximately million in the second half of our fiscal year results of operations in fiscal year  our consolidated results of operations were impacted by weak economic conditions in the united states and internationally  which resulted in substantially reduced spending on information technology initiatives 
during fiscal year  we continued to market and license our products and services primarily through a direct sales force and augmented our sales efforts through other relationships  such as with other software vendors  systems integrators  resellers and others 
our total revenues generated from operations outside of the united states increased slightly in fiscal year to from approximately in fiscal year no customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal year 
table of contents revenues years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages product licenses services total as a percentage of total revenue product licenses services total revenues increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was due to an increase in revenues for services due to a larger base of installed products and an increased reliance by our customers to use our consulting services personnel to implement our software 
as we license our products  whether on a perpetual basis for our universal content management software or on a term basis for our content components software  our installed base of products increases 
since the rate of annual renewals of post contract customer support services on our universal content management and content component software has remained high  our post contract customer support revenues have grown as our installed base of products has grown 
also  universal content management revenues related to consulting services work can increase as a result of a larger installed base of products 
we expect our installed base of products to continue to increase and our services revenue to grow 
total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues was due to a million decrease in our product license revenues as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown during that period  which resulted in a reduction in overall customer spending in information technology initiatives 
the decrease in product license revenues was partially offset by a million increase in revenues for services due to a larger base of installed products 
sales outside the united states represented   and of our total revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively 
product licenses revenues for product licenses increased by million  or  to million for year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in content components software revenues in the united states and europe and sales of universal content management software in japan 
the increase in our universal content management and content components software licenses was due to a moderate increase in demand mitigated by continued long sales cycles for those products 
the market for universal content management software and our products at any particular time is highly dependent on information technology spending and we cannot be uncertain whether  and if so  when  spending on information technology will rebound 
as a result of the optika merger  we anticipate that the percentage of license revenue to total revenue will remain consistent in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  but that license revenue in absolute dollars will increase as a result of the merger 
revenues for product licenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease of approximately million in universal content management and million in content components software revenues in the united states partially offset by a million increase in software revenues internationally 
the decrease in our universal content management and content components software licenses was due to low demand and long sales cycles for those products  both resulting from reduced information technology spending 

table of contents services years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages consulting services and training post contract customer support total as a percentage of total revenue services and training post contract customer support revenues for services  consisting of consulting services  training and post contract customer support  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues for services was due to a million increase in consulting services revenue as our customers software implementations have become larger and more numerous and an increase in post contract customer support of approximately million due to a larger installed base of universal content management and content component products 
as a result of the optika merger  we anticipate that the percentage of service revenue to total revenue will remain consistent in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  but that service revenue in absolute dollars will increase as a result of the merger 
generally  customers prefer to have us perform the consulting services rather than using internal information technology staff  a trend we believe will continue 
as we license our products  whether on a perpetual basis for our universal content management software or on a term basis for our content components software  our installed base of products increases 
since the rate of annual renewals of post contract customer support services on our universal content management and content component software has remained high  our post contract customer support revenues grow because we have a larger installed base of products 
also  universal content management revenues related to consulting services work can increase as a result of a larger installed base of products 
because we expect the trend toward companies increasingly using the web for communicating and publishing business information and the trend toward electronic devices being used increasingly to view electronic information to continue  we expect our installed base of products to continue to grow and our services revenues attributable to post contract customer support to continue to increase revenues for services  consisting of consulting services  training and post contract customer support  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues for services was attributable to an increase in post contract customer support due to a larger installed base of universal content management and content component products 
to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and services revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting services engagements 
additionally  since post contract customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a decline in customer support revenues 
however  since post contract customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will lag behind a decline in license revenues

cost of product licenses represented   and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cost of revenues for product licenses decreased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenues for product licenses was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the decrease in cost of revenues for product licenses was attributable to increased sales of our ccd products  which generally have a lower cost of sales than our universal content management products  a change in product mix in our universal content management products and a reduction in certain costs related to royalties for third party technology incorporated into our products  which became fully amortized in the previous fiscal year 
as new versions of our universal content management software continue to be released  we have elected to license or purchase more third party software to be included in our universal content management products in order for us to provide certain functionality that we believe is necessary to be competitive 
we expect to continue to license or purchase third party software to be included in our universal content management products  which may cause our costs of revenues to increase 
cost of revenues for product licenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenues for product licenses was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the increase in cost of revenues was attributable to increased amortization of prepaid royalties of approximately million and the increased amortization of capitalized software developed for us by a third party or purchased from a third party of approximately million 
as new versions of our universal content management software continue to be released  we have elected to license or purchase more third party software to be included in our universal content management products in order for us to provide certain functionality that we believe is necessary to be competitive 
we expect to continue to license or purchase third party software to be included in our universal content management products  which may cause our costs of revenues to increase 
amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions 
cost of revenues related to amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the cost of revenues for amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions was attributable to the amortization of capitalized software obtained in the acquisition of certain assets of resoft  kinecta  active iq  and ancept in july  april  march  and august  respectively 
the decrease in 
table of contents cost of revenues related to amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions was attributable to the completion in june of amortization of capitalized software related to our acquisition of ccd 
we acquired technology from the companies listed above to incorporate the technology into our universal content management products in order to maintain competitive functionality 
we expect to continue to evaluate selective potential acquisitions 
to the extent we consummate additional acquisitions  and depending on the structure of such acquisitions  the assets acquired and the consideration paid  our costs of revenues related to amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions may increase 
cost of revenues related to amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions increased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the increase in cost of revenues for amortization of capitalized software from acquisitions was attributable to the amortization over a three year period of million of capitalized software obtained in the acquisition of the assets of kinecta corporation in april we acquired kinecta for its proprietary content distribution technology and have incorporated the technology into our universal content management products in order to maintain competitive functionality 
cost of revenues services years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages consulting services and training post contract customer support total gross profit as a percentage of respective revenue consulting services and training cost of revenues post contract customer support cost of revenues gross margin services total cost of services revenues  consisting of personnel for consulting services  training and post contract customer support  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of revenues for services was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of services revenues was due to an increase in costs associated with the hiring and training of additional personnel and the use of outside contractors related to the significant growth in consulting services revenue 
the increase in the gross profit dollars was due to the increase in revenues from post contract customer support from a larger installed base of universal content management products  with little additional support staff needed  and a higher installed base of content component software  which requires very little support staff needed as support is generally provided by the company that embeds our software 
in general  we have had a fairly consistent rate of annual post contract support renewals in both our universal content management and content component software and better utilization of consulting services personnel related to our universal content management software 
as a result of the optika merger  we anticipate that our cost of consulting and training services as a percentage of total consulting and training revenue will decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year as we believe that we can optimize the combined departments and increase the services utilization 
during the recent economic slowdown  we saw less competition for skilled software post contract customer support personnel than we experienced during stronger economic periods 
if economic conditions improve  competition for skilled software post contract customer support personnel may increase and our services costs of revenues may increase and may offset certain of the anticipated cost savings related to the optika merger 
cost of services revenues  consisting of personnel for consulting services  training and post contract customer support  decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for 
table of contents fiscal year the increase in the gross profit dollars and as a percentage of services revenues was due to the increase in revenues from post contract customer support from a larger installed base of universal content management products  with little additional support staff needed  and a higher installed base of content component software  which required very little support staff  as support generally was provided by the company that embeds our software 
additionally  we had better utilization of our consulting services personnel in fiscal year who were providing the services 
since our support and service revenues have lower gross margins than our license revenues  our overall gross margins will typically decline if our support and service revenues increase as a percent of total revenues 
our cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of support and service revenues may vary from period to period  depending in part on whether the services are performed by our in house staff  subcontractors or third party system integrators 
if our customers perform more services activities in house or increase the use of third party systems integrators  our support and service revenues and cost of support and service revenues realized on a per customer basis may decline 
operating expenses sales and marketing years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages sales and marketing percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel and marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  for fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the increase in dollars was attributable to costs related to our global users conference held in october and other sales events  and was partially offset by reduced commission expenses related to the mix of products sold 
as a result of the optika acquisition  we believe that our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue will decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year as we optimize and combine the two sales and marketing departments and increase the productivity of our sales personnel 
during fiscal  we saw less competition for general software sales and marketing personnel than we experienced during stronger economic periods 
however  competition has intensified for sales personnel who have been successful in the current market conditions 
if economic conditions improve  competition for general software sales and marketing personnel may increase and our sales and marketing expenses may increase and may offset certain of the anticipated cost savings related to the optika acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  for fiscal year from fiscal year sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year approximately million of the decrease in sales and marketing expense was due to decreased staffing and related costs attributable to the restructurings of our company during fiscal year  reduced commission expense of approximately million as a result of decreased sales and decreased travel expense of approximately million 
we reduced sales and marketing expenses in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies to better align our operations with our revenue base 

table of contents general and administrative years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for  general corporate functions  including finance accounting  human resources  legal and information technology  as well as insurance  professional fees  facilities costs and bad debt expense 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from fiscal year  due to a decrease in expenses associated with fewer personnel as a result of the restructurings undertaken by the company and a decrease in bad debt expense of million partially offset by increased legal  accounting and other professional fees associated with additional regulations enacted by the federal government and by the class action lawsuit 
as a result of the optika acquisition  we believe that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year from fiscal year as we will consolidate the accounting  finance and human resource departments and operate these departments from our corporate headquarters 
additionally  we anticipate further expense reductions as a percentage of total revenue as we eliminate duplicate expenses such as certain insurance expenses and professional services expenses 
however  these expense reductions may be partially offset as we expect to be subject to increasing corporate governance regulations and may be required to increase general and administrative spending to comply with such regulations congress  the securities and exchange commission and the national stock exchanges have enacted or have proposed to enact for publicly traded companies 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expense dollars decreased by million  or  from fiscal year  due to decreased personnel expenses associated with fewer personnel as a result of the restructurings of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in the bad debt expense of approximately million 
the increase in bad debt was caused by certain of our customers becoming unable to pay their debts due to a downturn in their business  or discontinuation of their business caused by the downturn in the economy and the reduction in spending for high technology products 
research and development years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  third party contractors  facilities and related overhead costs associated with our product development and quality assurance activities 
for fiscal year  research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from fiscal year  due to reduced average headcount  the consolidation of research and development facilities and the completion of certain research and development projects in fiscal year as a result of the optika acquisition  we believe that our fiscal year research and development expenses will remain consistent as a percentage of total revenue as compared to fiscal year as no significant changes are anticipated with respect to headcount or currently scheduled programs 
for fiscal year  research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from fiscal year  due to decreased staffing and related costs as a result of the restructurings 
we reduced research and development expenses in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies to better align our operations with our revenue base 
the reduced average headcount is not anticipated to affect any of our new products currently in development or new version releases of our current 
table of contents products  but may delay or prevent progress on potential products not yet in development  particularly with our content component products 
acquisition and related costs years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages acquisition and related costs percentage of total revenues acquisition and related costs were million in fiscal year  of which million were related to a potential transaction with a japanese company that would have given us new wireless technologies and an avenue in japan to generate revenues for our universal content management software 
after proceeding with the due diligence  it was determined that the target company was not situated well enough for us to accomplish previously established goals 
the expenses associated with this project represent funds that we advanced to the company for a trade show  product integration testing and test marketing costs of the products 
the remaining million of acquisition costs represent final development milestone and bonus payments related to the acquisition of kinecta corporation in april and the acquisition of selected assets of active iq corporation 
because we believe market trends may result in consolidation of the content management software market  from time to time we may seek to acquire businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
depending on the size  nature and structure of any future business acquisitions  our acquisition and related costs expense may increase substantially 
acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal year consisted of uncapitalized costs related to our acquisition of resoft in july and the costs associated with developing the japanese market through a potential acquisition

a portion of the purchase price of certain assets of each of resoft and kinecta was allocated to certain intangible assets  such as customer base and trademarks  and is also being amortized over their useful lives of three years 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and other expense was million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year the decrease was attributable to the completion in june of amortization of intangibles related to our acquisition of ccd 
amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce ceased as of april  in connection with the adoption of sfas as a result  amortization expense decreased million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we believe the technology that was acquired in these acquisitions is necessary functionality to be competitive 
for fiscal  amortization of intangible assets acquired related to our acquisition of ccd in july  and our acquisition of resoft in july  accounted for as purchases 

table of contents restructuring charges years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages restructuring charges percentage of total revenues we assessed many factors in determining whether and when to restructure our operations  with a significant consideration being the performance of the economy and the for the information technology markets in the united states and in europe 
during fiscal year  in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million 
the restructuring charge was comprised of severance pay and benefits related to the involuntary termination of employees of approximately million with the remaining million related to a change in estimate related to the closing of facilities and other exit costs 
these cost reduction measures were taken to better align our business with our current revenue base and what we believe will be continued slow spending by companies in the high tech sector over the next year 
however  we may be required to re invest in certain areas to expand our customer base  grow our revenues and invest in product development  which may eliminate or exceed these cost savings 
for the fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  compared to no restructuring charges in the fiscal year these restructuring expenses were taken in the june  quarter of million  the september  quarter of million  the december  quarter of million and the march  quarter of million 
in connection with the integration of optika and in connection with management s plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  the company approved a restructuring plan on june  the restructuring plan includes the termination of employees of stellent  inc and the shutdown of the company s new york facility 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of fiscal year related to this plan are estimated to be approximately  to  the effect on expenses and cash flows over the next year associated with the termination of these employees is expected to be a decrease in expenses and increase in cash flow of approximately million 
the effect on expenses over the next year associated with the closing of the facilities and other exit costs is expected to have an immaterial effect on expenses and cash flows 
the expense decrease of approximately million is anticipated to be in the areas of cost of revenues for services of million and selling and marketing of million 
other income expense years ended march  percentage change to to in thousands  except for percentages interest income investment gain on sale impairment as a percentage of total revenues interest income investment impairment interest income 
interest income for all years was related to short term investments purchased with the proceeds of our public stock offerings completed in june and march the decreases in net interest income for the fiscal years ended march  and were due to decreases in the interest rates earned by invested funds which declined over each period  and reduced amounts of invested funds 

table of contents investment impairment 
during fiscal year  we sold our shares in a publicly traded company  an investment for which the value was previously written down to zero as the result of an other than temporary impairment 
we realized approximately million in proceeds and gain from the sale 
during fiscal year  our investment impairment was approximately million 
in the last quarter of fiscal year  after purchasing certain assets of active iq and reviewing its public disclosures  which stated it was selling the remaining operating assets of the company to another party  we determined that a permanent decline in value had occurred and recorded a write down of approximately million 
during the first three quarters of fiscal year  we determined that a permanent decline in the value of certain of our investments in other companies had occurred 
we made this determination after reviewing financial statements of these companies or discussing their future business plans and prospects with their management 
as a result  we recorded a write down on the investments in these companies of approximately million 
during the fiscal year  we determined that a permanent decline in the value of certain of our investments in other companies had occurred 
we made this determination after reviewing financial statements of these companies or discussing their future business plans and prospects with their management 
as a result  we recorded a write down on the investments in these companies of approximately million 
net operating loss carryforwards as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards on an annual basis will be limited as a result of ownership changes in connection with the sale of equity securities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  because of uncertainty regarding its full realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  management considered such factors as our history of operating losses  potential future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item a liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements through revolving working capital and term loans from banking institutions  private placements and public offerings of securities 
to date  we have invested our capital expenditures in property and equipment  consisting largely of computer hardware and software 
capital expenditures for fiscal year and were million and million  respectively 
we have also entered into capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
at march   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
as of march   we had million in cash and marketable securities and million in working capital 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  particularly through march  on a longer term basis  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or on any terms  or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that could utilize equity and or cash resources 
such opportunities could develop quickly due to market and competitive factors

net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal year resulted from a loss from operations of million offset by non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  and million related to investment impairment 
additional cash usage was the result of an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a decrease of million in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a decrease of million in accounts receivable and an increase of million in accounts payable and other 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense and increased our net loss in  and  respectively 
these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the extent to which these non cash items increase or decrease in amount and increase or decrease our future operating results will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers offset by payments to our employees  vendors and service providers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
days outstanding were days  days and days on march   and  respectively 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms on customer contracts and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our operating cash flows will also be impacted in the future based on the timing of payments to our vendors 
we endeavor to pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of vendor arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal year this resulted from net proceeds from investment activity of million and a million investment gain on 
table of contents sale  partially offset by approximately million to purchase property and equipment and million used to acquire ancept  inc net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year this resulted from net proceeds from investment activity of million  partially offset by million to purchase property and equipment and million to purchase kinecta and active iq 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year this resulted from net cash used in investment activity of million  partially offset by million of purchases property and equipment  million to purchase technology and approximately million of investments and notes in other companies 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we generally hold investments in commercial paper  corporate bonds and united states government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal included approximately million from the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by million of repurchased stock 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal included million of repurchased stock  partially offset by million from the net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal included approximately million from the net proceeds from issuance of common stock  partially offset by million in repurchased stock 
our cash flows from financing activities are the result of cash receipts from the issuance of common stock  our repurchases of common stock and treasury stock  and borrowings and payments under our lines of credit 
we have used our lines of credit to finance purchases of property and equipment 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions 
we may continue to use lines of credit to finance our equipment purchases to the extent that such financing is available to us on acceptable terms 
from time to time  our board of directors has approved common stock repurchase programs allowing management to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia pacific  australia and canada 
at the present time  the exposure is not significant 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
table of contents with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
contractual obligations the table below discloses a summary of the company s specified contractual obligations at march  in thousands under after total year years years years earn out payments operating leases total the company has agreed to make earn out payments dependent upon the future revenue performance of certain companies acquired 
the expected payments noted above were based on the anticipated future levels of revenues of the acquired companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  loss from operations and net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition we currently derive all of our revenues from licenses of software products and related services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under  i a signature license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and us  or  ii a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a signature license agreement with us or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
we do not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
delivery has occurred our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
we determine that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing 
table of contents terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
fees due under an arrangement are generally deemed fixed and determinable if they are payable within twelve months 
collectibility is probable and supported we determine whether collectibility is probable and supported on a case by case basis 
we may generate a high percentage of our license revenue from our current customer base  for whom there is a history of successful collection 
we assess the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we are unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and post contract customer support pcs components of our license arrangements 
we sell our consulting services separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over their respective terms  typically one year 
our direct customers typically enter into perpetual license arrangements 
our content components division generally enters into term based license arrangements with its customers  the term of which generally exceeds one year in length 
we recognize revenue from time based licenses at the time the license arrangement is signed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  if the term of the time based license arrangement is greater than twelve months 
if the term of the time based license arrangement is twelve months or less  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license arrangement 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and pcs 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
we bill consulting services fees either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price schedule 
in general  our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and generally do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase our consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately from professional services 
we recognize revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
our customers typically purchase pcs annually  and we price pcs based on a percentage of the product license fee 
customers purchasing pcs receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our 
table of contents initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for amounts deemed to be uncollectible 
management specifically analyzes its accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at march  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance  which related to specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and to a lesser extent our historical experience applied to accounts receivable not specifically reserved  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent and of total accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual due to the recent economic slowdown and associated reduction in information technology spending  we implemented a series of restructuring and facility consolidation plans to improve our operating performance 
restructuring and facilities consolidation costs consist of expenses associated with workforce reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce reductions in connection with our restructuring plans  we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
if continued service is required  then the severance liability is accrued over the required service period 
in general  we use a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and the employee s position within the company to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at march   no significant amounts were accrued for future severance and termination benefits payments 
excess facilities in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the lease obligations 
in determining fair value  we consider expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and related exit costs if any 
to determine the estimated sublease income  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during our evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may have suffered a reduction in their economic useful lives 
most of our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
at march   we had million accrued for excess facilities  which is payable through january we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at march   we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  consisting principally of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the company had us net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and foreign net operating losses of approximately million at march   which begin to expire in these nol s are subject to annual utilization limitations due to prior ownership changes 
realization of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
the deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we will continue to assess and evaluate strategies that will enable the deferred tax asset  or portion thereof  to be utilized  and will reduce the valuation allowance appropriately at such time when it is determined that the more likely than not approach is satisfied 
valuation and evaluation of impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
prior to april   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill  as well as identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives  should not be amortized but reviewed for impairment annually  when factors indicating impairment are present 
we completed our transitional goodwill impairment test on april  and determined that no impairment existed at that time 
we have elected to complete the annual impairment test of goodwill on january of each year 
we engaged an independent outside professional services firm to assist us in our impairment testing of goodwill as of january  based on this assistance  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test on january  and reviewed this valuation and our financial position as of january  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at those times 
additionally  no circumstances occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year which would have created an impairment loss at march  we evaluate the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event that events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred and when the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributed to such assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
no impairment of long lived assets has occurred through fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this eitf sets out criteria for whether revenue can be recognized 
table of contents separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the rights of returns for the delivered item 
we are required to adopt this eitf beginning april  the adoption of this eitf is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions in december  we entered into a note receivable of million with a distributor 
through march  the distributor paid the minimum payments required under the note receivable with its own cash  and at the end of march  it paid off the remaining note receivable with short term bridge financing 
the distributor completely repaid this short term bridge financing in april through a traditional banking relationship 
the short term bridge financing was provided at normal market rates by beartooth capital  a venture financing organization controlled and funded by robert olson  a shareholder and chairman of stellent 
there was no relationship prior to the bridge financing  and there is no existing relationship between beartooth capital and the distributor 
furthermore  we provided no compensation or guarantees to beartooth capital or robert olson for the short term bridge financing  nor were we otherwise involved in this transaction 
at march   we held investments in and notes with five non public start up technology companies  owning approximately to of these companies  and in publicly traded technology companies listed on nasdaq  primarily active iq  in which the company owned  exclusive of warrants 
at march   we had investments in two non public companies owning approximately to of these companies 
at march   our investments in these non public companies was approximately and of the companies  respectively 
a permanent decline in value had not been recorded in fiscal or for these investments 
investments in these companies were made with the intention of giving us opportunities to have new technologies developed for us or to give us leverage into certain vertical markets that we may not otherwise be able to obtain on our own 
the value of these investments at march  and was approximately million 
at march   the market value of our equity in active iq was approximately million more than the investment value of million 
this difference was reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended march  upon our acquisition of certain assets of active iq see note in march  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to its investment in active iq 
for substantially all of the year ended march   the company s investment in active iq was less than 
in fiscal  the company sold this investment and recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the year ended march   we recognized license revenue of approximately million from companies in which we had an equity investment  with approximately million coming from active iq in december at march   we had an account receivable balance of million associated from these transactions 
certain of our officers and directors also held investment interests in active iq during the year ended march   approximating 
these investments were sold at no gain during the year ended march  in december and march  we entered into sales transactions with a company affiliated with a member of our board of directors 
revenue of million and million from these sales transactions were recorded 
at march   we had an account receivable balance of million related to these transactions 
at march   we had no account receivable balance associated with these transactions 
during the year ended march   we entered into several transactions with companies affiliated with members of our board of directors 
revenue of million from these sales transactions was recorded during the year ended march  at march   we had an account receivable balance of approximately million associated with these transactions 

table of contents the terms and conditions  including fees  with respect to the transactions were substantially similar to those with unaffiliated third parties negotiated at arms length 
in march  we entered into a non exclusive reseller agreement with optika  inc  a company with which we had announced a definitive merger agreement in january see note 
the agreement provided for the sale of optika products by us 
in the year ended march   we recognized approximately million of revenue under the agreement 
risk factors disclosure regarding forward looking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks include those that we consider to be significant to your decision whether to invest in our common stock at this time 
there may be risks that you  in particular  view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may  in fact  harm our business in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 
you should consider carefully the following factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating our company and business 
because our infrastructure costs are generally fixed and the timing of our revenues from quarter to quarter is highly variable  our future performance is difficult to predict  making an investment in our common stock subject to high volatility 
while our products and services are not seasonal  our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
a large part of our sales typically occurs in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter 
if these sales were delayed from one quarter to the next for any reason  our operating results could fluctuate dramatically 
in addition  our sales cycles may vary  making the timing of sales difficult to predict 
furthermore  our infrastructure costs are generally fixed 
as a result  modest fluctuations in revenues between quarters may cause large fluctuations in operating results 
these factors all tend to make the timing of revenues unpredictable and may lead to high period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate for several additional reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the following demand for our products and services  the timing of new product introductions and sales of our products and services  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  research and development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web content management solutions  the mix of revenues from product licenses and services  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  
table of contents general economic conditions  and public announcements by our competitors 
we have a history of making acquisitions  including large strategic acquisitions  and future potential acquisitions may be difficult to complete or to integrate and may divert management s attention and cause our operating results to suffer 
we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition  successfully finance the acquisition or integrate the new business or products into our existing business and operations 
in addition  the negotiation of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses or products may divert management time and resources from our existing business and operations 
to finance acquisitions  we may use a substantial portion of our available cash or we may issue additional securities  which would cause dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be profitable in the future  which would cause our financial position to suffer and may cause the market price of our stock to fall 
our revenues may not grow in future periods and we may not achieve profitability 
if we do not achieve profitability  our financial position will suffer and the market price of our stock may fall 
our ability to achieve profitable operations depends upon many factors beyond our direct control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the demand for our products  our ability to quickly introduce new products  the level of product and price competition  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions 
the intense competition in our industry from recent and expected industry consolidation may reduce our future sales and profits 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is likely to become more competitive from recent and expected industry consolidation 
we may not be able to compete successfully in our chosen marketplace  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional competition may cause pricing pressure  reduced sales and margins  or prevent our products from gaining and sustaining market acceptance 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  and substantially more resources than we have 
competitors with greater resources than ours may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new opportunities  changing technology  product standards or customer requirements 
we depend on the continued service of our key personnel  if we lose the services of our key personnel our ability to execute our operating plan  and our operating results  may suffer 
we are a small company and depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if we lose any of these key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel with the highly specialized expertise necessary to generate revenue and to engineer  design and support our products and services 
like other software companies  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract or retain such personnel 

table of contents we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our universal content management software and content component software products for our revenues  if our universal content management software does not gain and maintain customer acceptance  our revenues and operating results may suffer 
we currently derive all of our revenues from product licenses and services associated with our system of content management and viewing software products 
the market for content management and viewing software products is new and rapidly evolving 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will continue or that it will be sustainable 
if we do not increase employee productivity and revenues related to our existing products or generate revenues from new products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we will continue to depend on revenues related to new and enhanced versions of our software products  and  if the merger is completed  on optika s products  for the foreseeable future 
our success will largely depend on our ability to increase sales from existing products  and  if the merger is completed  on optika s products  and generate sales from product enhancements and new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in upgrading and marketing our existing products or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services 
the market for our products is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change 
technological advances could make our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our business 
in addition  complex software product development involves certain inherent risks  including risks that errors may be found in a product enhancement or new product after its release  even after extensive testing  and the risk that discovered errors may not be corrected in a timely manner 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  which consists primarily of our proprietary software products  and do so cost effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or incur significant expense in doing so  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming and expensive 
we currently have one pending patent application  but  no patent has yet been issued 
without significant patent or copyright protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who develop functionally equivalent products 
we may also be subject to claims that our current products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
any such claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we anticipate that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims due to growth in the number of products and competitors in our industry  and the overlap in functionality of products in different industries 
any infringement claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  expensive to defend  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
we rely on trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information 
despite our attempts to protect our confidential and proprietary information  others may gain access to this information 
alternatively  other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent information 
our products may not be compatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  which may limit our ability to generate revenues from our products 
our products utilize interfaces that are compatible with commercial web browsers 
in addition  our stellent content management system is a server based system written in java that functions in both windows nt and unix environments 
we must continually modify our products to conform to commercial web browsers and operating systems 
if our products were to become incompatible with commercial web browsers and operating systems  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainty related to the timing 
table of contents and nature of product introductions or modifications by vendors of web browsers and operating systems may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be subject to product liability claims if our software products damage customers data  fail to maintain access security or otherwise fail to perform to specifications  which could harm our operating results and financial position and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock 
if software errors or design defects in our products cause damage to customers data and our agreements do not protect us from related product liability claims  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims if our security features fail to prevent unauthorized third parties from entering our customers intranet  extranet or internet websites 
our software products are complex and sophisticated and may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors  bugs or viruses spread by third parties may result in the loss of market acceptance or the loss of customer data 
our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions where we operate 
future regulation of the internet or affecting web base communications could be adopted that restrict our business  which may limit our ability to generate revenues from our products 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt new legislation or regulations governing the use and quality of web content 
we cannot predict if or how any future laws or regulations would impact our business and operations 
even though these laws and regulations may not apply to our business directly  they could indirectly harm us to the extent that they impact our customers and potential customers 
we have been named a defendant in securities class action lawsuits and we may in the future be named in additional litigation  which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
shareholder class action suits have been filed naming stellent and certain of our current and former officers and directors as co defendants 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the suits and seek the suits dismissal at the appropriate time 
however  because litigation by its nature is uncertain and the lawsuit is still in its early stages  the likelihood of a favorable outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
if the plaintiff prevailed in the lawsuit and the damages awarded against us significantly exceeded the limits of our insurance policies  this outcome could have a material adverse impact on our company s financial condition and results of operations 
more generally  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their securities 
this risk is greater for technology companies  which have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
we may in the future be the target of this kind of litigation  and such litigation could also result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to variations in our operating results  changes in the software industry and other factors  resulting in sudden changes in the market value of an investment in our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by each of the following factors  many of which are outside of our control 
table of contents variations in quarterly operating results  changes in estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  announcements of significant events  such as major sales  acquisitions of businesses or losses of major customers  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our equity securities 
if the web does not continue to grow and gain acceptance  the size of the potential market for our products will be limited and our revenues and operating results could suffer 
our products are designed to be used with intranets  extranets and the internet 
if the use of these methods of electronic communication does not grow  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
continued growth in the use of the web will require ongoing and widespread interest in its capabilities for communication and commerce 
its growth will also require maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure supporting its use and the development of performance improvements  such as high speed modems

risks related to our acquisition of optika realizing the benefits from our acquisition of optika requires us to overcome integration and other challenges which may be difficult because optika is accustomed to operating as an autonomous business 
any failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating our preexisting operations with those of optika or to realize any of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the acquisition could seriously harm our operating results 
realizing the benefits of the merger will depend in part on our ability to overcome significant challenges  including combining optika s colorado based operations with our minnesota headquartered preexisting operations  integrating and managing the combined company with a small management team  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of optika accustomed to working without the oversight of a parent company  integrating the sales organization of optika  which relies extensively on indirect sales channels and generates a high proportion of maintenance and other revenues  with our preexisting sales organization  which relies extensively on direct sales and generates a high proportion of product license revenues  retaining preexisting customers of each company in light of changes that may occur as a result of the acquisition and attracting new customers while overcoming integration challenges  retaining strategic partners in light of changes that may occur in each company s operations as a result of the acquisition and attracting new strategic partners while overcoming integration challenges  and creating and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information for two companies accustomed to operating under autonomous management 
the risks of failure to overcome these integration challenges include the potential disruption of our on going business and distraction of our management  lost sales or decreased revenues as a result of difficulties inherent in combining product offerings  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate effectively our capabilities  the potential need to demonstrate to customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business  and impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affec tour market value 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting  which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
under the purchase method of accounting  we will allocate the total estimated purchase price in the acquisition to optika s net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives based on their fair values as of 
table of contents the date of the closing of the acquisition  and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
these depreciation  amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  which may be difficult in light of the geographic separation of our headquarters and optika s operations  optika s history of operating as an independent business and uncertainty regarding operational roles following the acquisition  and failure to do so could seriously harm our ability to execute our operating strategy 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  sales and technical positions 
failure to do so could leave us without the management capacity to execute our operating strategy  which could adversely affect our operating results 
retaining and motivating optika employees may be difficult if we cannot overcome the geographic separation of optika s colorado operations and our minnesota headquarters to make employees feel like they are a part of a cohesive business operation 
we may experience difficulty retaining and motivating optika employees if those employees feel as though they had greater operating freedom when optika was an independent business 
our employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with us until or after our strategies are announced or executed 
these circumstances may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales and technical personnel 
we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals  which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger
