overview on assignment  inc is a leading provider of skilled temporary professionals to clients in the healthcare and science industries 
we provide our clients in these markets with short term or long term assignments of temporary professionals and temporary to permanent placement of these professionals 
our business consists of two operating segments healthcare staffing and lab support 
through our healthcare staffing segment  we are able to offer our clients temporary professionals  both locally based and traveling  from more than ten healthcare and medical financial occupations 
these temporary professional specialties include nurses  specialty nurses  surgical technicians  imaging technicians  x ray technicians  medical technicians  medical technologists  phlebotomists  coders  billers  claims processors and collectors 
through our lab support segment  we service the domestic and international markets for science professionals and provide temporary and temporary to permanent placement of scientific personnel to industrial laboratories in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical  food and beverage  personal care  chemical and environmental industries 
in  we expanded our service offerings to include engineering  clinical research  respiratory therapy  licensed vocational nurses and traditional week nurse travel assignments 
healthcare staffing segment revenues represented approximately percent of our total revenues for  up slightly from percent in and up from percent in the significant increase in our healthcare staffing segment revenues from to was principally due to our acquisition of health personnel options corporation hpo in april the acquisition of hpo put us much closer towards our goal of being a full service provider to our healthcare clients 
through this acquisition  we were able to enter the travel nurse and travel allied healthcare industries  supplement our locally based allied temporary professionals and become a more comprehensive partner to our healthcare clients 
consolidated revenues for were  down percent from  in we experienced a challenging year in as a result of a decrease in demand for our services and increased competition 
reduced lab support demand was influenced by recent periods of reduced economic activity  which resulted in lower needs for laboratory workers in research and development and quality control functions 
in healthcare staffing  many hospitals and health maintenance organizations took nurse staffing actions that temporarily decreased the demand for travel nurses  including increased overtime for their full time nurses  increased ratios of patients to nurses  and higher compensation for full time nurse positions 
we also believe the weaker economy induced part time nurses to work additional hours  nurses to delay retirement and retired nurses to re enter the workforce  which temporarily increased the supply of nurses available to work 
as demand decreased for the overall staffing industry  we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller  privately held organizations 
given the decline in revenue experienced by our respective segments  our primary focus during was on cost containment  including headcount reductions of employees and branch office closings 
these efforts were undertaken to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our anticipated revenue opportunities and to preserve our cash and cash equivalent balances 
we also placed emphasis on preserving our reputation for quality  service and reliability 
throughout the year we continued the upgrades of our infrastructure  primarily by advancing the implementation of peoplesoft  an enterprise wide information system 
along the way  we added efficiency to both our external and internal operations  and with the automation  we have greatly reduced our dependence on internal manual processes 
since the hiring of peter t 
dameris as executive vice president and chief operating officer in november  our senior management team has been focused on developing a solid revitalization plan to grow revenues and our market share 
this plan was built from the bottom up  market by market by analyzing each of our staffing service offerings 
the plan was approved by our board of directors on february   and we are now aggressively implementing the plan 
the plan is centered on improving our sales capabilities  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and depth of our operations management 
we are also focused on completing the company wide implementation of our peoplesoft erp system and on training our field staff to improve automation and efficiency 
in addition  we have tactically hired skilled industry veterans to augment our already experienced field management team 
our revitalization plan includes the expected hiring of incremental sales and fulfillment personnel in local healthcare  in lab support and in nurse travel 
local healthcare continues to be our most challenged line of business while nurse travel and lab support stabilized in the fourth quarter of another area of particular focus in will be the reduction of travel and housing costs at nurse travel and allied travel to improve our gross profit margins 
the plan also provides for upgraded training and mentoring of new and existing personnel 
each new hire has specific productivity and revenue quotas that  if achieved  will permit us to post positive revenue growth on a year over year basis 
however  due to the timing of resource investments associated with our revitalization plan and the current performance of local healthcare  at this time we do not expect to generate positive net income for the full year 
seasonality our results of operations have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
from november through february  revenues  operating income and net income in both our healthcare staffing and lab support segments  have been negatively impacted by fewer business days and the fall off of the number of temporary professionals willing to work during the holiday period 
in particular  many of our temporary professionals who like travel assignments often end their assignments before the holiday season in december to spend time with family and friends 
as is common in the staffing industry  we run special incentive programs to keep our temporary professionals  particularly nurses  working through the holidays 
additionally  demand for our temporary professionals in our lab support segment also often declines in june  july and august due to decreases in clients activity during vacation periods and the availability of students to perform temporary work 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables based on our analysis of specific accounts and historical collection experiences applied to the remaining general accounts 
for specific accounts  we use our judgment  based on available facts  circumstances and conversations with clients or the lack thereof  to record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
for the remaining accounts  a general reserve is established based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change by a material amount 
accrued workers compensation 
we are partially self insured for workers compensation expense 
the workers compensation program covers all of our temporary professionals and regular employees 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
in order to ensure that the accrued workers compensation balance is adequate to cover all costs incurred under our workers compensation program  at the end of each fiscal quarter  an actuarial report is prepared by an independent third party who calculates our self insurance claim liability based on historical experience and trends of industry data 
if historical experiences and industry trends change  the self insurance claim liability calculated by the third party actuary could change by a material amount 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and workers compensation matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  results of operations may be over or understated 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  fas no 
requires  subsequent to january   that we review and test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  rather than amortize them 
we may be required to review and test for impairment more frequently if an event occurs that indicates that the assets may be impaired 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  fas requires us to allocate goodwill to our various businesses to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those businesses to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value of the businesses 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this requires independent valuations of certain internally generated and previously unrecognized intangible assets 
when this process is completed  the amount of goodwill impairment will be determined 
with respect to our goodwill impairment testing  the fair market value of our reporting units was estimated by us using the income approach  which utilizes forecasted discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value 
judgments and assumptions about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
although we believe the judgments and assumptions used in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate  there is nonetheless a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved 
we concluded at june  that significant events had occurred for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis  requiring us to perform an analysis prior to our next regularly scheduled impairment testing date  december   to determine whether the recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
the fair market value was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
based on this comparison  we determined that the goodwill related to one of the reporting units in the healthcare staffing segment was impaired 
we recognized an impairment charge of  during the second quarter of at december   we performed another analysis on our remaining goodwill balance of  and we determined there was no further impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill for further impairment as required under fas no

in addition  we experienced intensified competition from both national and international staffing firms as well as from smaller  privately held organizations 
our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees  primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition 
decreased lab support segment revenues were partially offset by a percent increase in average billing rates during the year ended december  due to an increase in bill rates and favorable exchange rates 
healthcare staffing segment s revenues decreased by  or percent from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues resulting from our acquisition of hpo decreased percent from  for the period april  through december  to  for the full year ended december  this decrease in revenue was due to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on travel assignments as demand was negatively impacted as many hospitals took actions that temporarily decreased the demand for travel nurses  given their higher costs  as well as intensified competition and lower patient censuses 
in addition  we were negatively impacted by a shift in the mix of business to all inclusive billing from the direct billing of reimburseable travel and housing expenses without a corresponding increase in average bill rates 
excluding the effect of the hpo acquisition  revenue decreased percent from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a percent decrease in conversion fee revenue from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   other than revenues related to hpo  were adversely impacted by lower client demand for our temporary professionals due to weak economic conditions  increased competition  and high turnover and loss of market share 
our conversion fee revenue was lower as fewer temporary professionals were converted into permanent employees  primarily due to the weak economy and increased competition 
decreased healthcare staffing revenues were partially offset by a percent increase in average billing rates in the period primarily due to a change in product mix and an increase in bill rates

cost of services decreased  or percent from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  cost of services attributable to the hpo acquisition increased by percent from  for the period april  through december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of services for hpo were primarily due to an increase in compensation  incentives  workers compensation and state unemployment insurance related to our temporary professionals 
excluding the effect of the hpo acquisition  cost of services decreased percent or  from  for the period to  for the period 
the cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased by percent from percent in the period to percent in the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to a percent increase in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  a 
percent increase in hpo travel and housing expenses  and 
percent net increase in workers compensation expense 
the lab support segment s cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by 
percent from percent in the period to percent in the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to a percent increase in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  partially offset by a 
percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a 
percent decrease in workers compensation expense 
the healthcare staffing segment s cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by percent from percent in the period to percent in the period

percent increase in hpo travel and housing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with our network of staffing consultants and branch offices for lab support and local healthcare staffing  including staffing consultants compensation  rent  other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals 
for nurse travel and allied travel  selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation for regional sales directors  account managers and recruiters as well as rent  other office expenses and advertising for temporary professionals who desire to travel

in addition  we incurred higher staff compensation expenses  higher expenses related to the implemention of peoplesoft including hosting fees and depreciation expense  increased insurance fees and consulting fees and the amortization of identifiable intangibles related to the hpo acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to the hpo acquisition were  for the period april  through december  and  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from percent for the period to percent in the period primarily due to higher fixed operating expenses relative to revenue and costs associated with our headcount reductions and branch office closures 
impairment of goodwill 
based on our impairment analysis at june   we concluded that goodwill  related to one of our reporting units in the healthcare staffing segment  was impaired 
as required by fas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill of the reporting unit 
based on this allocation  we concluded that  of recorded goodwill was impaired 
the goodwill impairment has been expensed as a non cash charge to continuing operations during the second quarter of at december   we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill for further impairment as required under fas no 
interest income 
interest income  net  decreased percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower average balances in our interest bearing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities account balances due primarily to cash used in the april hpo acquisition 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes decreased from  for the year ended december   to a benefit of  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the difference in our tax rate for the year ended december   as compared with the corresponding period of was primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment recognized in the period 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment  the effective tax rate would have been percent for this represents a decrease from percent in primarily due to permanent non deductible differences  the effect of international operations and an adjustment to our state tax receivable balance 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased  or percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  revenue resulting from our acquisition of hpo was  for the period april  through december  excluding the effect of the hpo acquisition  our revenue decreased percent or  compared to year ended december  lab support segment s revenues decreased  or percent from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a percent decrease in the average number of temporary professionals on assignment and a percent decrease in permanent placement fee revenue from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by lower needs for our temporary professionals  particularly in the biotechnology sector  due to a slow down in research and development and quality control spending caused by the weak economy

revenues for the year ended december   other than revenues related to hpo  were adversely impacted by lower needs for our temporary professionals due to weak economic conditions  increased competition and internal operational challenges  including high turnover and under representation in certain markets 
decreased healthcare staffing revenues were partially offset by a percent increase in permanent placement fee revenue from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  and a percent increase in average billing rates in the period

percent increase in workers compensation expense  partially offset by a 
percent decrease in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes 
the healthcare staffing segment s cost of services as a percentage of segment revenues increased by percent from percent in the period to percent in the period 
this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of hpo  which has a higher cost of services than the other divisions within the healthcare staffing segment  partially offset by a percent decrease in temporary professionals compensation and payroll taxes  a 
percent decrease in employer paid benefits and a

provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased percent from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased from percent in period to percent in the period 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a lower amount of tax free interest income in the period 
liquidity and capital resources our operating cash flows are our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our working capital at december  was  including  in cash and cash equivalents 
our working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable and related payroll expenses 
although we currently do not have a borrowing facility in place  we believe we have the ability to enter into a borrowing facility if and when we deem such facility appropriate 
because we rely on cash flows from operations as our primary source of liquidity  we are subject to the risk that a decrease in demand for our staffing services could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
however  as we demonstrated in  our business model allows us to rapidly adapt to challenging business conditions 
given the decline in revenue experienced by our respective segments during  our primary focus was on cost containment  including headcount reductions of employees and branch office closings 
during  we expensed  in costs related to these headcount reductions and branch office closings 
these efforts were undertaken to streamline our organization and better align our resources and cost structure with our anticipated revenue opportunities and to preserve our cash and cash equivalent balances 
for  we generated positive operating cash flow of  and we increased our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances by  we expect the growth of our businesses may result in increased working capital needs in order to finance increases in accounts receivable and related payroll expenses 
we expect to incur an additional  to  in capital expenditures over the next months related to our peoplesoft enterprise wide information technology system  leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases 
we maintain considerable control over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and believe we would be able to adjust these expenditures if the need arose 
funds used in investing activities for the year ended december  were  which primarily consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment  proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities and proceeds for the recovery of the hpo escrow 
funds used for financing activities in were  which consisted primarily of funds used for repurchases of common stock partially offset by funds raised through the exercise of common stock options and proceeds from the employee stock purchase program 
on june   the board of directors authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to  shares of on assignment s common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market at a total cost of  to date  we have purchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of  long term liabilities shown on our consolidated balance sheet were  at december   compared to  at december  deferred income taxes of  for year ended december  accounts for percent of long term liabilities 
the increase in long term liabilities is primarily the result of deferred income taxes related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of hpo 
the remaining  represents deferred rent expense 
pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated march  between on assignment  on assignment acquisition corp  hpo and certain stockholders of hpo   of the merger consideration payable to hpo was deposited in escrow with  of the escrowed funds subject to recovery by on assignment in the event that hpo failed to meet a certain revenue hurdle for the calendar year 
in january  on assignment notified the hpo stockholder representative that hpo did not meet the revenue hurdle and  in accordance with the merger agreement  requested that  of the merger consideration be returned to on assignment in the form of  in cash and  in shares of on assignment s common stock equivalent to  shares of our common stock based on a day average price determined under the terms of the merger agreement 
in march  this amount was returned to us 
as described under overview and business growth strategy above  we are currently implementing a revitalization plan that was approved by our board of directors on february  the plan involves improving our sales capabilities  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and depth of our sales operations management 
our revitalization plan includes the expected hiring of incremental sales and fulfillment personnel in local healthcare  in lab support and in nurse travel 
the plan also provides for upgraded training and mentoring of new and existing personnel 
each new hire has specific productivity and revenue quotas that we believe  if achieved  will permit us to post positive revenue growth on a year over year basis 
however  due to the timing of resource investments associated with our revitalization plan and the current performance of our local healthcare division  at this time we do not expect to generate positive net income for the full year 
while there can be no assurances in this regard  we expect that internally generated cash together with our borrowing ability will be sufficient to support our working capital needs and other obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
commitments and contingencies we have completed our initial implementation of a peoplesoft enterprise wide information technology system 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately  in capital expenditures related to this project 
there were no costs incurred for this project prior to we expect to incur an additional  to  in capital expenditures over the next months related to our peoplesoft enterprise wide information technology system  leasehold improvements and various equipment purchases 
as discussed in business contained in this report  we lease space for our corporate and branch offices 
during  we entered into an amendment to our original lease with respect to our corporate offices located in calabasas  california 
this agreement calls for a seven year extension of the existing lease term from march to march we have committed to base rental payments totaling  over the term of the agreement with the last monthly payment due on march  rent expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth  on an aggregate basis  at december   the amounts of specified contractual cash obligations required to be paid in the periods shown in thousands  net of sublease income contractual obligations thereafter total operating lease obligations     for additional information about these contractual cash obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
however  based on the facts currently available  we do not believe that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are partially self insured for workers compensation expense 
in connection with this program  we pay a base premium plus actual losses incurred up to certain levels and are insured for losses greater than certain levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the self insurance claim liability is determined based on claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported 
we account for claims incurred but not yet reported based on actuarial reports prepared by an independent third party who reviews historical experience and current trends of industry data 
changes in estimates and differences in estimates and actual payments for claims are recognized in the period that the estimates changed or payments were made 
the net self insurance claim liability amounted to approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no

generally  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december   and  for other types of vies  for periods ending after march  we have reviewed this pronouncement and determined it is not applicable since we do not own or have an investment in any vies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk from our held to maturity investments 
the interest rate risk is immaterial due to the short maturity of the majority of these investments 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from the translation of foreign operations into us dollars 
based on the relative size and nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a ten percent change in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would have a material impact on our financial statements 
we do not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments 
all of our investments are in short term  investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments
