item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements filed with this report 
business overview our commercial business is focused on the dermatology marketplace  which is characterized by a large patient population that is served by a relatively small  and therefore more accessible  group of treating physicians 
we currently market two pharmaceutical products  olux and lux q 
both products have clinically proven therapeutic advantages and we are providing quality customer service to physicians through our experienced sales and marketing professionals 
effective march   we own exclusive us rights to a third product  soriatane  which is discussed below in subsequent events 
in addition to revenue from product sales  we receive royalties on sales of rid  actimmune and ridaura in the us  and internationally on sales of banlice  milice  bettamousse  and  through  on a super concentrated aerosol spray licensed worldwide 
we have licenses with novartis and with pfizer  which have the potential to bear royalties in the future depending on approval of their products for sale 
to enable us to focus on our core sales and marketing activities  we selectively outsource certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as manufacturing  warehousing and distribution 
as we expand our activities in these areas  we expect to invest additional financial resources in managing those outsourced functions 
we assess our product sales using a market share analysis that takes into account prescriptions written for the total us steroid market  the ratio of prescriptions written for olux and lux q to the whole market  and the ratio of prescriptions for our products to prescriptions for specific brands that we believe are being actively positioned against our products 
we sell product directly to wholesale distributors and to one national retail pharmacy chain  however  whereas patients have their prescriptions filled by pharmacies that buy the drug from the wholesalers 
accordingly  the number of prescriptions written for our products only indirectly affects our product revenues 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our product revenues are derived from four major customers 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
wholesale customers rarely provide us with information on complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely entirely on our wholesale and retail pharmacy customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
we can give no assurances that these customers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid spot outages 
based on historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we monitor wholesaler inventory using a combination of techniques  including evaluating how much inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers  which we do by tracking the prescriptions filled for our products at the pharmacy level 
this is an inexact science  and requires us to monitor and assess the desirable level of wholesaler inventory  industry average wholesaler inventory  seasonal 
table of contents demand  and other factors 
we estimate prescription demand for our products primarily by analyzing third party syndicated data sources that track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
these third party data sources are extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies  and are estimates of historical demand levels  so our estimates are subject to inherent limitation of estimates that rely on third party data 
we observe trends from these data  and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for purchase orders for finished inventory from our third party manufacturers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for products 
wholesaler buying patterns and wholesaler inventory levels may not reflect underlying prescriber demand 
conversely  underlying prescriber demand my not accurately predict our reported net sales in a given period 
if we overestimate demand  we may have excessive inventory production  if we underestimate demand  we may not have an adequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our products  consistent with a health care provider s prescription 
because our products compete in markets which offer multiple alternative drugs  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended prescribed connetics brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
such availability strongly reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or greatly influence the purchasing patterns of wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase our products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of our major customers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given financial period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of one or more of our products during the same financial period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel  which are managed presumably in accordance with such customer s business practices 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon the relative timing of events or uncertainties that may arise 
for example  the following events or occurrences could cause fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period changes in the levels we spend to develop new product lines  changes in the amount we spend to promote our products  changes in treatment practices of physicians that currently prescribe our products  changes in reimbursement policies of health plans and other similar health insurers  forward buying patterns by wholesalers that may result in significant quarterly swings in revenue reporting  increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products  the development of new competitive products by others  the mix of products that we sell during any time period  and our responses to price competition 

table of contents certain events in during  we had three product candidates in phase iii clinical trials extina  a foam formulation of a concentration of the antifungal drug ketoconazole  for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis  actiza  a foam formulation of clindamycin for the treatment of acne  and velac gel  a first in class combination of clindamycin and tretinoin for the treatment of acne 
extina and actiza are delivered in our proprietary foam delivery system 
in april  we announced the outcome of a phase iii clinical trial evaluating extina 
the four week  double blinded active and placebo controlled trial included patients at centers 
as designed  the trial results successfully demonstrated that extina was not inferior to nizoral ketoconazole cream as measured by the primary endpoint of isga 
the trial was also designed to compare extina to placebo foam per the isga 
the result  although in favor of extina  did not achieve statistical significance 
on all other endpoints  statistical significance was achieved  therefore  we believe that the totality of the data demonstrated that extina was clinically superior to placebo foam 
in july  we submitted an nda to the fda for extina 
the fda initially informed us that a user fee was required for the extina nda  but in december the fda agreed that no user fee was required 
the fda did not  however  accept the nda retroactive to the original filing date  and in january we re submitted the nda for extina 
in may we issued million of convertible senior notes in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of the notes bear an interest rate of per year and have a five year term 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which represents a premium over the closing price of our common stock on the date the offering was announced 
we are using the proceeds from the offering to augment our cash reserves for general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of soriatane  capital expenditures and working capital 
on july   we assigned our rights to recombinant human relaxin to bas medical  a private  development stage company focused on the development and marketing of novel medical treatments 
as part of the transaction  we may receive up to million in licensing and milestone fees  plus royalties on future product sales 
we received a  upfront assignment fee when the agreement was executed that we recognized as license revenue in the third quarter of we will receive the remaining  if bas medical achieves various milestones 
bas medical assumed rights to develop and commercialize relaxin for all indications of use 
all of our obligations under existing contracts related to relaxin were also transferred to bas medical as part of this transaction  and as a result in we recognized  in deferred revenue relating to previous relaxin license agreements 
on september   we announced the positive outcome of the phase iii clinical trial evaluating actiza 
the week  double blinded  active and placebo controlled trial included  patients at centers across the us the trial was designed to demonstrate that actiza was not inferior to clindagel clindamycin phosphate topical gel as measured by the primary endpoints of isga and in percent reduction in lesion counts total  inflammatory and non inflammatory from baseline to week end of treatment 
success was defined as achieving non inferiority to clindagel for two out of three lesion counts and for isga 
the trial results met or exceeded all of these requirements 
additionally  actiza was statistically superior to placebo for all primary endpoints 
adverse events with actiza were mild to moderate in nature and were related primarily to burning at the application site 
on december  we filed an nda with the fda for actiza 

table of contents subsequent events on january   we reached an agreement with sc johnson to terminate an existing license agreement pursuant to which we licensed to sc johnson the rights to a concentrated aerosol spray that is marketed in the us and internationally 
on a consolidated basis  in  we received million in royalties in connection with this agreement  which included a one time royalty payment of million 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  we will cease recognizing royalties after the first quarter of  and sc johnson will have a fully paid up license to the technology 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a binding purchase agreement with roche to acquire exclusive us rights to soriatane brand acitretin  an approved oral medicine for the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults 
the transaction closed on march  under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid roche a total of million in cash at the closing to acquire soriatane 
we also agreed to assume certain liabilities in connection with returns  rebates and chargebacks  and we are obligated to buy roche s existing inventory within thirty days after the closing of the acquisition 
on february   in connection with the soriatane acquisition  we entered into a million credit facility provided by goldman  sachs credit partners lp we formally terminated the credit facility on february   without incurring any indebtedness under the facility 
on february   we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock to accredited institutional investors at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million without giving effect to certain offering costs 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to pay for the acquisition of exclusive us rights to soriatane  and we intend to use the balance for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates which are used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require us to make estimates and judgments due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events that are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition reserves for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we allow a discount for prompt payment  and we estimate other allowances based primarily on our past experience 
we also consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  trends in distributor inventory  economic trends that might impact patient demand for our products including competitive environment  current arrangements with managed care organizations  the economic value of the rebates being offered and other factors 
in the past  actual discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns  rebates and chargebacks in the future period are inherently uncertain 
our revenue reserves are approximately of our gross product revenues 
if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our reported revenue  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported revenue 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 

table of contents we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
as a practice  we avoid shipping product that has less than ten months dating 
we monitor inventories in the distributor channel to help us assess the rate of return 
we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable by us to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs 
generally  we pay managed care organizations and state medicaid programs a rebate on the prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective programs 
we determine the reserve amount at the time of sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to managed care and state medicaid patients  adjusted to reflect historical experience and known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
revenue recognition contract revenue we record contract revenue for research and development as it is earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
we recognize royalty revenue in the quarter in which the royalty payment is either received from the licensee or may be reasonably estimated  which is typically one quarter following the related sale by the licensee 
we recognize non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which we have no continuing involvement  on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront license fees ratably over the period in which we have continuing development obligations when  at the time the agreement is executed  there remains significant risk due to the incomplete state of the product s development 
revenue associated with substantial at risk performance milestones  as defined in the respective agreements  is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones 
we recognize revenue under r d cost reimbursement contracts as the related costs are incurred 
goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet 
to judge the fair value of long lived assets  we make various assumptions about the value of the business that the asset relates to and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by the asset or  in the case of goodwill  the enterprise 
this may include assumptions about future prospects for the asset and typically involves computation of the estimated future cash flows to be generated 
based on these judgments and assumptions  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its actual fair value 
judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the judgments and assumptions we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different judgments and assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these assets would result in greater impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges and higher asset values 
for more details about how we make these judgments  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues consist of revenues from the sale of products  royalty revenues  and contract revenues generated from agreements with third parties 
we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks 
typically  increases in product revenue are a result of a combination of increased sales volume and increased sales prices of our products 
years ended december  in thousands change change product olux lux q ridaura n a  other total product revenues royalty royalty license and contract relaxin related contract revenue pfizer formerly pharmacia  n a novartis n a intermune celltech other contracts total license  contract and royalty revenues total revenues our net product revenues were million in compared to million in and million in increased sales volumes for olux and lux q in accounted for of this increase in our net product revenues and increases in pricing accounted for the remaining of this increase in the net product revenues 
total net product revenues increased in compared to combined increased sales volumes for olux and lux q accounted for a increase in our net product revenues not including revenues from ridaura compared to higher sales prices accounted for the remainder of the increases in net revenues of those products in compared to the increase in product revenues was partially offset by increases in our revenue reserves and a decrease in ridaura revenue after the sale of that product in april we recognized million of royalty  license and contract revenues in  compared to million in and million in royalty  license and contract revenue was higher for compared to primarily because we received a one time royalty payment of million from sc johnson 
we received royalties in connection with the sc johnson license agreement in the amount of million in and million in  which included a one time royalty payment of million 
on january   we reached an agreement to terminate the license agreement with sc johnson 
we will cease recognizing royalties under this agreement after the first quarter of  which will have a significant impact on our royalty revenue for also affecting the increase in  we recognized  of relaxin related revenue associated with the execution of the agreement with bas 
table of contents medical in july of the relaxin related revenue   represented previously deferred revenue associated with relaxin license agreements with other parties that was fully recognized upon the execution of the bas medical agreement 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in contract revenue from other third parties related to one time contract payments made in we expect no further relaxin related revenue 
the increase in license revenue in from was partially due to revenue recognized in association with an agreement we entered into in december with pfizer and an expanded license agreement with novartis 
we have an agreement with pfizer pursuant to which pfizer has exclusive global rights  excluding japan  to our proprietary foam drug delivery technology for use in rogaine hair loss treatment 
we recognized million under the pfizer agreement in the agreement with novartis expanded the existing global license to novartis consumer health to cover liquipatch drug delivery system for use in topical antifungal applications 
novartis will continue to be responsible for all product development cost  and pay us license fees  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognized  of revenue related to this agreement in we have an agreement with intermune pursuant to which intermune pays us royalties for sales of actimmune gamma interferon 
in connection with the agreement  intermune paid us approximately  in  which was offset by related product rebates and chargebacks of  we recorded  and  in royalty revenue related to actimmune sales in and  respectively 
in august  we entered into an agreement with intermune to terminate our exclusive option for certain rights in the dermatology field in exchange for a payment of  we recognized the full amount of this revenue in we anticipate that product revenue will increase in due to continued sales growth of olux and lux q as well as the addition of over nine months of revenue related to soriatane product sales 
in  we anticipate that license and contract revenue and royalty revenue will decrease  as several revenue sources in will not recur in  in particular  the royalties from sc johnson 
beyond  we expect license revenue to fluctuate significantly depending on whether we enter into additional collaborations  when and whether we or our partners achieve milestones under existing agreements  and the timing of any new business opportunities that we may identify 
cost of product revenues years ended december  as a of net as a of net as a of net product product product in thousands revenues revenues revenues cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the third party costs of manufacturing olux  lux q  ridaura until april  depreciation costs associated with connetics owned equipment located at the dpt facility in texas  royalty payments based on a percentage of our product revenues  and product freight and distribution costs from sps  the third party that handles all of our product distribution activities 
the total increase in the cost of product revenues for compared to is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume of our products  as well as the establishment of a  reserve recorded during related to minimum purchase commitments under our manufacture and supply agreement with dpt 
if the effects of the  reserve from the year to date are excluded  we experienced a slight improvement in our gross product margin due to the combined effects 
table of contents of the price increases for olux and lux q  effective in the fourth quarter and the second quarter  and slightly lower cost of manufacturing our products 
the increase in total cost of product revenues in as compared to was the result of an increase in sales volumes 
on a product basis  cost of product revenues decreased to in from in when we acquired connetics australia  we began to eliminate all intercompany transactions in consolidation  which included our royalty expense and connetics australia s related royalty income 
our cost of product revenues decreased from to on a percentage basis primarily because we eliminated intercompany royalties of million 
that decrease was partially offset by an average increase in the cost per unit of our products of approximately 
research and development years ended december  in thousands change change research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials  such as clinical investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  external research programs  and an allocation of facilities costs  salaries and benefits  and overhead costs such as rent  supplies and utilities 
in and  our research and development expenses primarily consisted of years ended december  category preclinical and clinical research in the development of new dermatology products million million quality assurance and quality control in the maintenance and enhancement of existing dermatology products million million optimization of manufacturing and process development for existing dermatology products million million manufacturing  process development and optimization of dermatology products under development million million quality assurance and quality control in the development of new dermatology products million million basic research and formulation of new dermatology products million million regulatory review of new and existing dermatology products million million in  our research and development expenses primarily consisted of new dermatology product efforts million  relaxin development efforts prior to the may decision to reduce investment in the program million  development efforts to expand the usage of existing dermatology products million  and costs to integrate connetics australia into our research and development efforts from april million 
we are conducting research on a number of potential therapeutic products for new indications that are in various phases of clinical and pre clinical development 
pharmaceutical research and 
table of contents development programs  by their nature  require a substantial amount of financial and human resources and the fda may not approve our product candidates for marketing 
the costs to develop all of our potential drugs through all clinical phases would cost substantially more than the funds currently available to us 
we are unable to predict the level of spending until near the end of the various programs because of the uncertainty of fda approval of clinical study programs 
we caution that many of our development efforts could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that any of our clinical research will reach the stage of an nda or that the nda will be approved 
the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our product candidates currently in clinical trials as well as other current research and development programs 
the actual timing of completion of phases of research could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the discussion of clinical risks set forth in factors affecting our business and prospects 
clinical development is inherently uncertain and expense levels may fluctuate unexpectedly because we cannot accurately predict the timing and level of such expenses 
estimated completion of accumulated program related phase of phase iii research and development description indication development clinical trials expenses through extina 
foam formulation of ketoconazole for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis 
nda filed completed million actiza 
foam formulation of clindamycin for the treatment of acne 
nda filed completed million velac 
gel formulation of clindamycin and tretinoin for the treatment of acne excluding license and milestone payments to yamanouchi 
phase iii mid million pre clinical research and development for multiple dermatological indications 
pre clinical n a million in general  we expect research and development expenses to remain consistent in due to ongoing research and clinical trials 
consistent with our development model  we have multiple product candidates in product formulation  at least two in late stage clinical trials  and we expect to launch at least one new product or indication commercially in pharmaceutical products that we develop internally can take several years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
we cannot reliably estimate the overall completion dates or total costs to complete our major research and development programs 
the clinical development portion of these programs can span several years and any estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products 
the fda defines the steps required to develop a drug in the us clinical development typically involves three phases of study  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see factors affecting our business and prospects we cannot sell our current products and product candidates if we do not obtain and maintain governmental approvals and we may spend a significant amount of money to obtain fda and other regulatory approvals  which may never be granted and our 
table of contents continued growth depends on our ability to develop new products  and if we are unable to develop new products  our expenses may exceed our revenues without any return on the investment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with finance  legal  insurance  marketing  sales  and other administrative matters 
years ended december  in thousands change change selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in over primarily due to higher labor and benefit expenses due to increased headcount million increase  higher expenses related to product sampling and sales promotion programs million increase  higher cost of outside service and other fees primarily related to warehousing  distribution and production of sales and marketing materials  increase  increased business development activities  increase  and higher outside legal expenses incurred  increase 
those increases were partially offset by a  decrease in various marketing activities such as tradeshows  honorariums  and medical education 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in over primarily due to the introduction of product samples million increase  higher labor and benefit expenses due to increased head count as well as having a full year of expanded sales force compared to eight months in million increase  and an increase compared to in depreciation expenses related to equipment purchased to support increased headcount of  those increases were partially offset by million in non cash stock compensation expense in that did not recur in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be slightly higher in than in because we will have a full year of expenses related to increased headcount in the sales and marketing departments 
we also anticipate increased marketing spending related to the commencement of marketing efforts in anticipation of approvals for extina and actiza 
in connection with the soriatane acquisition  we also anticipate increased marketing  sales  finance  legal and other administrative costs in connection with launching the product 

table of contents acquired in process research and development and milestone payments in may  we entered into an agreement with yamanouchi europe bv to license velac gel a first in class combination of clindamycin  and tretinoin 
we have licensed exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the product in the us and canada  and have licensed non exclusive rights in mexico 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid yamanouchi an initial million licensing fee  which we recorded as acquired in process research and development expense in  because the product remains in clinical development and has no alternative future use 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase iii trial for velac 
under the terms of the agreement  we recorded an additional million of acquired in process research and development expense related to this milestone 
in april  we acquired connetics australia then known as soltec for approximately million 
we accounted for this transaction using the purchase method and allocated million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development  based on a third party valuation  and the balance to the tangible assets of connetics australia  existing developed technology and goodwill 
acquired in process research and development consisted of several projects  which involved the use of novel technologies to improve the delivery of drugs 
the projects were and still are in various stages of development and are subject to substantial risks  and did not have alternative future uses 
the value of the in process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis with a rate of 
in addition  the stage of completion of each project was considered in determining the value 
these projects may not meet either technological or commercial success 
the products under development have no foreseeable alternative future uses 
the estimates we used in valuing in process research and development were based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but they are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the results projected for purposes of determining the fair value of the acquired in process research and development

cash flows from investing activities 
we received cash from investing activities in  and used cash in investing activities in and in  we used cash in investing activities primarily as the result of a significant net increase in purchasing of marketable securities following the convertible debt financing 
we had only moderate increases in operating expenses in twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in  but our property and equipment expenditures decreased by million in compared to the decrease is primarily because we had expenditures in that were not repeated in  including million related to the construction of an aerosol filling line at dpt s plant in texas  which occurred in in  our principal uses of cash for investing activities were net purchases of marketable securities and the acquisition of connetics australia  which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the ridaura product line 
cash flows from financing activities 
financing activities provided million in cash during and million in cash during in  we used  in financing activities 
the increase in primarily represents million of net proceeds we received from the issuance of convertible senior notes 
we recognized million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants and stock options during compared to the proceeds of million from the sale of common stock 
during  million of previously restricted certificates of deposits related to our controlled disbursements account  security deposit in connection with an operating lease arrangement  and collateral on certain officers personal bank loans were released 
for the same period in   of previously restricted certificates of deposit were released one related to a security deposit on our facility and the other related to collateral on certain officers personal bank loans 
working capital 
our working capital increased by million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the convertible debt financing which we completed in the second quarter of working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily because in we used cash in operations and for the acquisition of acquired in process development 
working capital at december  includes cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
giving effect to the net proceeds of the private placement that closed on february   and the use of cash to purchase exclusive us rights to soriatane and existing soriatane inventory from roche  our

the notes are convertible at any time at the option of note holders into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the amounts reflected above include annual interest payments of approximately million per year  assuming that the notes are not redeemed or converted before maturity 
we lease laboratory and office facilities under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through under our agreement with dpt  we are also obligated to pay approximately  per year in rent for the pro rata portion of dpt s facility allocated to the aerosol line 
under the dpt agreement  we will pay rent for the term of the agreement or as long as we own the associated assets  whichever is longer 
we also lease various automobiles and office equipment under similar leases  expiring through these obligations are to be partially offset by  to be received from subleasing arrangements with third parties 
in march we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with dpt that requires minimum purchase commitments  beginning six months after the opening of the commercial production line and continuing for years 
also in we entered into a license agreement that requires minimum royalty payments beginning in and continuing for fifteen years  unless the agreement is terminated earlier by either party 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from product sales and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
the amount of our future product revenues is uncertain  as product sales can be impacted by patent risks and competition from new products  and products under development may not be safe and effective or approved by the fda  or we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities at reasonable costs  and the products may not gain satisfactory market acceptance 
the amount of capital we require for operations in the future depends on numerous factors  including the level of product revenues  the 
table of contents extent of commercialization activities  the scope and progress of our clinical research and development programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 
if we need funds in the future to in license or acquire additional marketed or late stage development products  a portion of the funds may come from our existing cash  which will result in fewer resources available to our current products and clinical programs 
to take action on business development opportunities we may identify in the future  we may need to use some of our available cash  or raise additional cash by liquidating some of our investment portfolio and or raising additional funds through equity or debt financings 
on february   we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock to accredited institutional investors at a price of per share 
we intend to use the net cash after giving effect to the soriatane acquisition for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our other products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements eitf in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
eitf requires us to divide revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
eitf also requires us to allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and to consider applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements we enter into after june  there was no impact on our financial statements from the adoption of eitf fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin  as amended  applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after march  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations
