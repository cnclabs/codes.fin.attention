the year was characterized by weak industrial and consumer demand in many of the company s businesses 
core unit volumes grew an estimated percent in  compared to an estimated percent to percent in core unit volume growth is a measure of sales performance that excludes the estimated impact of acquisitions  divestitures  changes in product mix and pricing  and currency translation 
management uses this measure to evaluate underlying demand for the company s products and services  and to assess sales trends over time 
the year was particularly challenging for the company s office products business  where sales declined during the year  due to weak end user demand 
in the fourth quarter  the office products business began to reflect the impact of an estimated million loss in annualized sales related to one major customer 
in addition  weak underlying demand in the company s north american and western european markets created a difficult pricing environment for several of the company s businesses 
in europe  for example  the roll materials business was unable to secure adequate price increases to offset the negative margin impact of the british pound gbp weakening relative to the euro 
in the fourth quarter  the company experienced an acceleration of the rate of growth in ongoing unit volumes compared to the rate of growth experienced in the preceding three quarters  which resulted in better than expected net sales and net income for the quarter 
this acceleration in growth was experienced in most of the company s businesses and geographic regions in which it competes 
the company believes that this improvement in underlying demand reflected the generally improving economic and market conditions affecting the company s businesses  as well as the success of the company s growth initiatives  discussed below

the company is participating with other prps at all such sites  and anticipates that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the epa or other governmental authorities 
the company has accrued liabilities for all sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a prp  where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities  future expense to remediate the currently identified sites  and sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup  could be higher than the liability currently accrued

none of these transactions are significant to the financial position or results of operations of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution 
table of contents of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves  inventory reserves  long lived asset impairments and pensions and postretirement benefits 
revenue recognition sales  provisions for estimated sales returns  and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers 
actual product returns are charged against estimated sales return allowances 
sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which the company operates 
volume  promotional  price  cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales 
rebates and discounts are recorded based upon management s best estimates when products are sold 
these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products 
management reviews such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
accounts receivable allowances and customer complaint reserves management is required to make judgments  based on established aging policy  historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
approximately percent and percent of trade receivables were from eight customers of the company s office products business in and  respectively 
the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 
long lived asset impairments the company records impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable 
impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair value 
fair value is typically determined using an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
changes in market conditions and management strategy have historically caused the company to reassess the carrying amount of its long lived assets 
pensions and postretirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the company s pension plan and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that the company determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return  or health care costs  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management risk management the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company s policy is not to hold or purchase foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk on earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  the company enters into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objectives  the company may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings 
in connection with the issuance of the million year senior notes  the company settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss of approximately million 
the loss is currently being amortized to interest expense over years  which corresponds to the term of the related debt 
the company entered into the interest rate swap in may to secure the interest rate on the company s anticipated long term debt issuance 
the principal amount hedged was million 
because of a shift in interest rates  an unrealized loss of approximately million was included in other comprehensive loss at the end of in the normal course of operations  the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risks  which are not represented in the analyses that follow 
foreign exchange value at risk the company uses a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of the company s domestic banks 
a percent confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 

table of contents the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for the company s foreign exchange positions and contracts was million at year end interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average floating rate interest rate affecting the company s variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on the company s earnings
