table of contents part ii plantronics annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
in addition  we may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
these statements may generally be identified by the use of such words as expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  will  or shall  and include  but are not necessarily limited to  all of the statements marked below with an asterisk 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to the following the office  contact center  mobile  computer  residential  and other specialty product markets not developing as we expect  and a failure to respond adequately to either changes in technology or customer preferences 
for a discussion of such factors  this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with the risk factors affecting future operating results  included herein 
the following discussions titled annual results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with those risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of lightweight communications headsets for phones and cell phones  telephone headset systems  accessories and related services for business and personal use 
in addition  we manufacture and market specialty telephone products  such as telephones for the hearing impaired and other related products for people with special communications needs 
we are a global company  and sell our broad range of communications products into more than countries through a worldwide network of distributors  oems  wireless carriers  retailers and telephony service providers 
we have well developed distribution channels in north america and europe  where headset use is fairly widespread 
our distribution channels in other regions of the world are less mature and primarily serve the contact center market in those regions 
our revenues grew significantly during the fiscal year ended march   primarily on the strength of new products in general  and headsets for mobile phones  in particular 
the mobile market has experienced strong growth due to a number of factors including hands free legislation in the uk and italy and a strong assortment of new phones on the market 
in addition  we believe our market share for headsets for mobile phone applications has increased  but that the level of market share we experienced recently may be unsustainable 
markets for wireless headsets are growing and the need for hands free communication tools has led to greater acceptance of our wireless products 
we have been able to improve our production and cost effectiveness and exceeded our operating margin target of in fiscal year during fiscal year  our overhead costs remained fairly constant due to productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies which resulted in an increase in our gross margin percentage as compared to fiscal year increases in our operating expenses as compared to fiscal year were primarily driven by variable sales and marketing expenses commensurate with our overall increase in sales and the foreign exchange effects of a weak dollar vs 
the euro and the great british pound on expenses in our international operations 
however  as a percentage of sales  our operating expenses decreased in fiscal year  which contributed to our overall increase in operating income 
for the year ended march   our operating margin improved to from in the previous fiscal year 
we have established a target of for operating margin for fiscal year 
table of contents plantronics annual report in addition  during fiscal year  we generated million in operating cash flows  which significantly contributed to the increase in our liquidity and cash balances at march  we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements 
annual results of operations net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn increased compared to fiscal net sales of million 
fiscal years and contained weeks and fiscal year contained weeks 
in comparison to fiscal  revenues for fiscal were stronger across all of our product lines  and were driven primarily by sales of new products 
both domestic and international revenues were up  resulting in part from recent hands free legislation  increased demand for headsets for mobile phones and for wireless headsets for the office  the incremental sales from the additional rd week and the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international revenues 
the incremental effect of the rd week contributed approximately million or of the increase year over year based on a linear calculation 
our headsets for mobile phones includes both corded headsets sold to us wireless carriers and bluetooth based headsets sold primarily for use in europe with yearly sales up over the prior fiscal year 
our office and contact center products business grew from the prior year  primarily driven by the continued ramp of our cs product in europe  a wireless headset for dect based office phones 
in the us  office and contact center product sales were favorably affected by the launch of our cs product  a wireless headset for mhz based office phones 
computer audio product sales grew as compared to the prior year 
computer audio product growth was primarily a broadbased growth as a result of expanded retail distribution channels 
in fiscal  our sales growth was primarily attributable to revenues from new products developed within the prior months including office  mobile and computer products and to the addition of the acquired ameriphone products for a full fiscal year  which contributed approximately million of the total growth 
compared to fiscal  on a worldwide basis  fiscal revenues increased in all major geographies and channels 
domestic sales increased to million in fiscal  compared to an increase of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased in all major us channels  with the most significant increase in our oem distribution channel 
domestic sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased in all major us channels  with the exception of oem  with the most significant increases in sales through our retail channel and sales of our clarity formerly walker ameriphone products for the hearing impaired 
international sales accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  up from of total net sales in fiscal and in fiscal international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn increased compared to million in fiscal the sales increase in fiscal reflected growth in each of the european  asia pacific latin american and canadian regions and was favorably affected by the continued strengthening of the euro and the great british pound against the us dollar and new product introductions during the year  as well as sales from the extra week in fiscal international sales in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  in each of the european  asia pacific latin american and canadian regions reflecting the continued strengthening against the us dollar of the euro and the great british pound during the year 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal gross profit in fiscal increased compared 
table of contents part ii plantronics annual report to gross profit of million of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was favorably affected by foreign exchange rates  manufacturing efficiencies from higher volume associated with increased sales and the continued cost reduction efforts during the year 
in fiscal  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was favorably affected by foreign exchange rates and the achievement of cost reduction goals during the year 
sales of the acquired ameriphone products  which had slightly better margins than the average of our other products during fiscal  also contributed modestly to the gross margin improvement in fiscal in addition  we were successful at better inventory management  which led to lower requirements for provisions relating to excess and obsolete material 
we also experienced lower requirements for warranty and improved factory utilization due to higher volumes on relatively fixed manufacturing overhead 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased compared to million of net sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in these expenses in fiscal reflected our continued support of new product introductions  with particular emphasis on mobile and wireless headset development 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue our development efforts in the mobile and wireless areas 
the increases in these expenses in fiscal reflected a marked increase in the number of products in the pipeline at a particularly active stage of development  our continued investment in new product development including bluetooth and other wireless technologies  and a general broadening of our product line in each of our markets 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased compared to million of net sales in fiscal the overall increase in the level of spending in fiscal and was to support increased revenues with sales and marketing programs capitalizing on legislation for hands free devices and also reflected the strengthening of the euro and the great british pound against the dollar during the year  which increased the cost of marketing programs in europe 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly driven by unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased as a percentage of net sales from fiscal  mainly driven by higher legal expenses  a larger provision for doubtful accounts  and the inclusion of a full year of expenses relating to ameriphone 
operating income 
operating income in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal operating income in fiscal increased compared to million of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in operating income over fiscal was primarily driven by higher net sales and improved gross margins due to economies of scale  offset in part by higher operating expenses and unfavorable product mix 
in fiscal  the increase in operating income over fiscal was primarily driven by improved gross margin on higher net sales 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net in fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn increased million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal was primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange rates on both the euro and the great british pound 
the increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to foreign exchange gains as the euro and great british pound values strengthened against the dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains  net of the effect of hedging activity for each of fiscal and were 
table of contents plantronics annual report million 
foreign currency transaction losses  net of the effect of hedging activity  for fiscal was million 
income tax expense 
in fiscal   and  income tax expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
our effective tax rates for these years were   and  respectively 
in fiscal and fiscal  our effective tax rates included benefits of million and million  respectively  due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and a favorable tax assessment 
in fiscal  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
financial condition operating activities 
during fiscal year  we generated million of cash from operating activities  due primarily to million in net income  an income tax benefit of million associated with the exercise of stock options  depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable  a decrease in deferred income taxes of million  an increase in other current assets of million  an increase of million in inventory  and a decrease of million in income taxes payable 
in comparison  we generated million in cash from operating activities for the fiscal year  due mainly to million in net income  depreciation and amortization of million  an income tax benefit of million associated with the exercise of stock options  a decrease of million in inventory and an increase of million in accrued liabilities  respectively  offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in income taxes payable 
investing activities 
during fiscal  we purchased capital assets of million  which included the land and facilities purchase of our previously leased facilities in swindon  uk for approximately million 
we believe that this purchase could yield an attractive return on investment as well as lower our annual operating costs in comparison to leasing 
the remainder of the capital purchases were incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements for facilities expansion 
we also received million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
during fiscal  we purchased marketable securities of million and received proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of million 
expenditures for capital assets of million were incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements for facilities expansion 
financing activities 
during the fiscal year ended march   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share  and reissued through employee benefit plans  shares of our treasury stock for million 
as of march   we remained authorized to repurchase  shares under all repurchase plans 
we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended march  in the fiscal year ended march   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share  and reissued through employee benefit plans  shares of our treasury stock for million 
we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources 
we generated positive cash flows from operations for fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively 
our primary cash requirements have been  and are expected to continue to be  for capital expenditures including investment in manufacturing operations in china and tooling for new products and leasehold improvements for facilities improvements and expansion 
we estimate that fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million 
as of the end of fiscal  we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents compared with working capital of million  including 
table of contents part ii plantronics annual report million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as of the end of fiscal during the next to months  we are planning or considering certain other capital expenditures related to facilities  including  among other things  the continued upgrade of our corporate offices in santa cruz  california  and the development of a factory and development center in china 
subsequent to year end we leased land use rights for the factory development center in china 
the total capital cost of these initiatives are uncertain and could range from to million 
we have a revolving credit facility with a major bank for million  including a letter of credit subfacility 
the facility and subfacility both expire on july  as of april  we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility 
the amounts outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility were principally associated with purchases of inventory 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
these covenants may adversely affect us to the extent we cannot comply with them 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under this agreement 
throughout fiscal and  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of expected foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
in april of  plantronics began an additional hedging program to hedge a portion of euro and great british pound revenues with put and call option contracts 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the net fair value of our unrealized option contracts 
gains and losses associated with realized option contracts are recorded against revenue 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations that were reasonably likely to occur as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than more than march   in thousands total year years years years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations foreign exchange contracts total contractual cash obligations we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see 
table of contents plantronics annual report certain forward looking information and risk factors affecting future operating results included herein  for factors that could affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon plantronics consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue net of estimated product returns and expected payments to resellers for customer programs including cooperative advertising  marketing development funds  volume rebates  and special pricing programs 
product returns are provided against revenues upon shipment  based on historical return rates  the product stage relative to its expected life cycle  and assumptions regarding the rate of sell through to end users from our various channels based on historical sell through rates 
should product lives vary significantly from our estimates  or should a particular selling channel experience a higher than estimated return rate  or a slower sell through rate causing inventory build up  then our estimated returns  which net against revenue  may need to be revised 
reductions to revenue for expected and actual payments to resellers for volume rebates and pricing protection are based on actual expenses incurred during the period  on estimates for what is due to resellers for estimated credits earned during the period and any adjustments for credits based on actual activity 
if market conditions warrant  plantronics may take action to stimulate demand  which could include increasing promotional programs  decreasing prices or increasing discounts 
such actions could result in incremental reductions to revenue and margin at the time incentives are offered 
to the extent that we reduce pricing  we may incur reductions to revenue for price protection based on our estimate of inventory in the channel that is subject to such pricing actions 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
plantronics maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if deemed necessary 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on projected future shipments using historical selling rates  and taking into account market conditions  inventory on hand  purchase commitments  product development plans and life expectancy  and competitive factors 
if markets for plantronics products and corresponding demand decline  then additional write downs may be necessary 
warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and our costs to repair or replace the products 
should actual failure rates and costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty obligation may be required 

table of contents part ii plantronics annual report goodwill and intangibles 
as a result of acquisitions we have made  we have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
these assets affect the amount of future amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets  as well as the useful life of amortizable intangible assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets 
if actual or expected revenue significantly declines  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
deferred taxes 
we record deferred tax assets at the amounts estimated to be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of the corresponding assets  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  then an adjustment would be required 
risk factors affecting future operating results investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below 
our stock price will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  our competition  expectations of securities analysts or investors  general economic and market conditions and industry conditions 
you should carefully consider the following factors in connection with any investment in our stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of the risks occur 
should any or all of the following risks materialize  the trading price of our stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
a significant portion of our sales come from the contact center market and a decline in demand in that market could materially adversely affect our results 
we derive approximately to of our net sales from the contact center market and we expect that this market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
while we believe that this market may grow in future periods  this growth could be slow or revenues from this market could be flat or decline in response to various factors 
for example  legislation enabling consumers to block telemarketing calls may adversely affect growth in the contact center market 
a deterioration in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in the establishment of new contact centers and in capital investments to expand or upgrade existing centers  which may continue to negatively affect our business 
because of our reliance on the contact center market  we will be affected more by changes in the rate of contact center establishment and expansion and the communications products that contact center agents use than would a company serving a broader market 
any decrease in the demand for contact centers and related headset products could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we are seeing a proliferation of speech activated and voice interactive software in the market place 
we have been re assessing long term growth prospects for the contact center market given the growth rate and the advancement of these new voice recognition based technologies 
businesses that first embraced them to resolve labor shortages at the peak of the last economic up cycle are now increasing spending on these technologies in hopes of reducing total costs 
we may experience a decline in our sales to the contact center market if businesses increase their adoption of speech activated and voice interactive software as an alternative to customer service agents 
should this trend continue  it could cause a net reduction in contact center agents and our revenues to this market segment could decline rather than grow in future years 

table of contents plantronics annual report new product development is risky  and our business will be materially adversely affected if we do not respond to changing customer requirements and new technologies 
historically  the technology used in lightweight communications headsets has evolved slowly 
new products have primarily offered stylistic changes and quality improvements  rather than significant new technologies 
the technology used in hands free communications devices  including our products  is evolving more rapidly now than it has historically and we anticipate that this trend may accelerate 
we believe this is particularly true for our newer emerging technology products especially in the mobile  computer  residential and certain parts of the office markets 
we believe products designed to serve these markets generally exhibit shorter lifecycles and are increasingly based on open standards and protocols 
as we develop new generations of products more quickly  we expect that the pace of product obsolescence will  increase concurrently 
the disposition of inventories of obsolete products may result in reductions to our operating margins and materially adversely affect our earnings and results of operations 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing market requirements  and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and end user requirements 
the technologies  products and solutions that we choose to pursue may not become as commercially successful as we planned 
we may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits from our investments in new technologies 
if we are unable to develop and introduce enhanced or new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  including changing fashion trends and styles  it will materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the development of the office  mobile  computer and residential markets  and we could be materially adversely affected if they do not develop as we expect 
while the contact center market is still a substantial portion of our business  we believe that our future prospects will depend in large part on the growth in demand for headsets in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
these communications headset markets are relatively new and continue to be developed 
moreover  we do not have extensive experience in selling headset products to customers in these markets 
if the demand for headsets in these markets fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we are unable to effectively market our products to customers in these markets  it would have a material adverse effect on the potential demand for our products and on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
these headset markets are also subject to general economic conditions and if there is a slowing of national or international economic growth  these markets may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in particular  we are under obligation to absorb from our retailers products which have failed to sell as expected  and in some instances  such products may be returned to our inventory 
should product returns vary significantly from our estimate  then our estimated returns  which net against revenue  may need to be revised 
we have strong competitors and expect to face additional competition in the future 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of companies in the various markets for communications headsets 
currently  our single largest competitor is gn netcom  a subsidiary of gn great nordic ltd  a danish telecommunications conglomerate 
internationally  sennheiser communications is a significant competitor in the computer  office and contact center market 
we currently operate principally in a multilevel distribution model we sell most of our products to distributors who  in turn  resell to dealers or end customers 
gn netcom s acquisitions indicate it may be 
table of contents part ii plantronics annual report moving towards a direct sales model  since six of their nine acquisitions were of companies employing direct sales and marketing models 
while we believe that our business and our customers benefit from our current distribution structure  if gn netcom or other competitors sell directly  they may offer lower prices which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we also expect to face additional competition from companies that currently do not offer communications headsets 
we believe that this is particularly true in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
for example  the sony ericsson joint venture has also announced the launch of several bluetooth hands free solutions 
we anticipate other competition from consumer electronics companies that currently manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment 
these new competitors are likely to be larger  offer broader product lines  bundle or integrate with other products communications headset tops and bases manufactured by them or others  offer products containing bases that are incompatible with our headset tops and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we also expect to face additional competition from companies  principally located in the far east  which offer very low cost headset products  including products which are modeled on  or are direct copies of our products 
these new competitors are likely to offer very low cost products which may result in price pressure in the market 
if market prices are substantially reduced by such new entrants into the headset market  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we do not match production to demand  we will be at risk of losing business or our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
historically  we have generally been able to increase production to meet increasing demand 
however  the demand for our products is dependent on many factors and such demand is inherently difficult to forecast 
we have experienced sharp fluctuations in demand  especially for headsets for wireless and cellular phones 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand and the global trend towards consignment of products could cause the following operating problems  among others if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess inventory and excess capacity 
over forecast of demand could result in higher inventories of finished products  components and subassemblies 
if we were unable to sell these inventories  we would have to write off some or all of our inventories of excess products and unusable components and subassemblies 
excess manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower margins 
if demand increases beyond that forecasted  we would have to rapidly increase production 
we depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and subassemblies  and are experiencing greater dependencies on single source suppliers 
therefore  we might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand 
this could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations 
there could be short term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production 
if customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs  there could be a long term impact on our revenues 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for components and subassemblies  increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials  and higher overtime costs and other expenses 
these higher expenditures could lower our profit margins 
further  if production is increased rapidly  there may be decreased manufacturing yields  which may also lower our margins 
the introduction of bluetooth and other wireless headsets presents many significant manufacturing  marketing and other operational risks and uncertainties  including developing and marketing these wireless headset products  unforeseen delays or difficulties in introducing and achieving volume production of such products  our dependence on third parties to supply key 
table of contents plantronics annual report components  many of which have long lead times  and our ability to forecast demand and customer return rates accurately for this new product category for which relevant data is incomplete or not available 
we have longer lead times with certain suppliers than commitments from some of our customers 
in particular  a major customer only provides us with a day commitment while we commit to inventory purchases beyond this time period 
as this inventory is unique to this customer and we have no alternative means of selling any finished products  this could potentially result in significant write downs of excess inventories 
any of the foregoing problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions involve material risks 
we may in the future acquire other companies 
there are inherent risks in acquiring other companies or businesses that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with acquisitions include  among others cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired company  the risk that the consolidation of the acquired company may not produce the enhanced efficiencies or be as successful as we may have anticipated  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  difficulties in integrating the transactions and business information systems of the acquired company  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions  particularly those of high technology companies  are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also manage any acquisition related growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
the failure of our suppliers to provide quality components or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our results 
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials  components  subassemblies and products from our suppliers 
we buy raw materials  components and subassemblies from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products 
we also have certain of our products manufactured for us by third party suppliers 
the cost  quality  and availability of such goods are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
obtaining raw materials  components  subassemblies and finished products entails various risks  including the following we obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from single suppliers and alternate sources for these items are not readily available 
to date  we have experienced only minor interruptions in the supply of these raw materials  subassemblies  components and products  none of which has significantly affected our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions could lead to a higher risk of failure of our suppliers to remain in business or to be able to purchase the raw materials  subcomponents and parts required by them to produce and provide to us the parts we need 
an interruption in supply from any of our single source suppliers in the future would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents part ii plantronics annual report prices of raw materials  components and subassemblies may rise 
if this occurs and we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers or to achieve operating efficiencies that would offset the increases  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from certain foreign suppliers  we may not be able to react quickly to changes in demand  potentially resulting in either excess inventories of such goods or shortages of the raw materials  subassemblies  components and products 
lead times are particularly long on silicon based components incorporating radio frequency and digital signal processing technologies and such components are an increasingly important part of our product costs 
failure in the future to match the timing of purchases of raw materials  subassemblies  components and products to demand could increase our inventories and or decrease our revenues  consequently materially adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to provide us with raw materials  components and subassemblies 
rather  we buy most raw materials  components and subassemblies on a purchase order basis 
if our suppliers experience increased demand or shortages  it could affect deliveries to us 
in turn  this would affect our ability to manufacture and sell products that are dependent on those raw materials  components and subassemblies 
this would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we generally use standard raw materials  parts and components for our products  the high development costs associated with emerging wireless technologies permits us to work with only a single source of silicon chip sets on any particular new product 
we  or our chosen supplier of chip sets  may experience challenges in designing  developing and manufacturing components in these new technologies which could affect our ability to meet time to market schedules 
due to our dependence on single suppliers for certain chip sets  we could experience higher prices  a delay in development of the chip set  and or the inability to meet our customer demand for these new products 
our business  operating results and financial condition could therefore be materially adversely affected as a result of these factors 
we sell our products through various channels of distribution that can be volatile 
we sell substantially all of our products through distributors  retailers  oem s and telephony service providers 
our existing relationships with these parties are not exclusive and can be terminated by either party without cause 
our channel partners also sell or can potentially sell products offered by our competitors 
to the extent that our competitors offer our channel partners more favorable terms  such partners may decline to carry  de emphasize or discontinue carrying our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified channel partners 
further  such partners may not recommend  or continue to recommend  our products 
in the future  our oem customers or potential oem customers may elect to manufacture their own products  similar to those we currently sell to them 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  oem s  retailers and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution channels could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the growth of our mobile headset business  our customer mix is changing and certain oem s and wireless carriers are becoming significant 
this greater reliance on certain large customers could increase the volatility of our revenues and earnings 
in particular  we have several large customers whose order patterns are difficult to predict 
offers and promotions by these customers may result in significant fluctuations of their purchasing activities over time 
if we are unable to anticipate the purchase requirements of these customers  our quarterly revenues may be adversely affected and or we may be exposed to large volumes of inventory that cannot be immediately resold to other customers 

table of contents plantronics annual report our stock price may be volatile and the value of your investment in plantronics stock could be diminished 
the market price for our common stock may continue to be affected by a number of factors  including uncertain economic conditions and the decline in investor confidence in the market place  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in our published forecasts of future results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market  general market conditions  and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular  and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the majority of our revenues come from products currently produced in our facilities in tijuana  mexico 
the majority of our revenues come from products that are produced in our facilities in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood or earthquake  political unrest or other disaster or condition affecting our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict their occurrence  duration or cessation 
while we have developed a disaster recovery plan and believe we are adequately insured with respect to these facilities  we may be unable to implement the plan effectively or to recover under applicable insurance policies 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
during march the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and the proposed statement eliminates the treatment for share based 
table of contents part ii plantronics annual report transactions using apb and generally would require share based payments to employees be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
the proposed standard would require the modified prospective method be used  which would require that the fair value of new awards granted from the beginning of the year of adoption plus unvested awards at the date of adoption be expensed over the vesting term 
in addition  the proposed statement encourages companies to use the binomial approach to value stock options  as opposed to the black scholes option pricing model that we currently use to estimate the fair value of our options under sfas disclosure provisions 
the effective date the proposed standard is recommending is for fiscal years beginning after december  should this proposed statement be finalized  it will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on our consolidated results of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this will result in lower reported earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  should the proposal be finalized  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
we believe that the expected expense related to the fair value of our stock options under the binomial model as proposed by the fasb will be slightly less than the black scholes valuation approach 
we have significant foreign operations and there are inherent risks in operating abroad 
during fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were derived from customers outside the united states 
in addition  we conduct the majority of our headset assembly operations in our manufacturing facility located in mexico  and we obtain most of the components and subassemblies used in our products from various foreign suppliers 
we also purchase a growing number of turn key products directly from asia 
the inherent risks of international operations  either in mexico or in asia  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include  among others cultural differences in the conduct of business  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  economic and political conditions in each country  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
changes in regulatory requirements may adversely impact our gross margins as we comply with such changes or reduce our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to comply 
our products must meet the requirements set by regulatory authorities in the numerous jurisdictions in which we sell them 
as regulations and local laws change  we must modify our products to address those changes 
regulatory restrictions may increase the costs to design and manufacture our products  resulting in a decrease in our margins or a decrease in demand for our products if the costs are passed along 
compliance with regulatory restrictions may impact the technical quality and capabilities of our products  reducing their marketability 

table of contents plantronics annual report we have intellectual property rights that could be infringed by others and we are potentially at risk of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our copyrights  patents  trademarks  trade dress  trade secrets  and other intellectual property  including our rights to certain domain names 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent  trademark  trade secret  and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
effective trademark  patent  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed to customers 
we currently hold united states patents and additional foreign patents and will continue to seek patents on our inventions when we believe it to be appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive 
patents may not be issued in response to our applications  and patents that are issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged by others 
if we are required to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights through litigation  the costs and diversion of management s attention could be substantial 
in addition  the rights granted under any patents may not provide us competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property rights  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to potential lawsuits alleging defects in our products and or hearing loss caused by our products 
the use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability and hearing loss claims 
these claims have in the past been  and are currently being  asserted against us 
none of the previously resolved claims have materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations  nor do we believe that any of the pending claims will have such an effect 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability or hearing loss claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our mobile headsets are used with mobile telephones 
there has been continuing public controversy over whether the radio frequency emissions from mobile telephones are harmful to users of mobile phones 
we believe that there is no conclusive proof of any health hazard from the use of mobile telephones but that research in this area is incomplete 
we have tested our headsets through independent laboratories and have found that use of our headsets reduces radio frequency emissions at the user s head to virtually zero 
however  if research was to establish a health hazard from the use of mobile telephones or public controversy grows even in the absence of conclusive research findings  there could be an adverse impact on the demand for mobile phones  which reduces demands for headset products 
there is also continuing and increasing public controversy over the use of mobile telephones by operators of motor vehicles 
while we believe that our products enhance driver safety by permitting a motor vehicle operator to generally be able to keep both hands free to operate the vehicle  there is no certainty that this is the case and we may be subject to claims arising from allegations that use of a mobile telephone and headset contributed to a motor vehicle accident 
we maintain product liability insurance and general liability insurance that we believe would cover any such claims 
however  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents part ii plantronics annual report while we believe we comply with environmental laws and regulations  we are still exposed to potential risks from environmental matters 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we have included in our financial statements a reserve of million for possible environmental remediation of the site of one of our previous businesses 
while no claims have been asserted against us in connection with this matter  such claims could be asserted in the future and any liability that might result could exceed the amount of the reserve 
we are actively working to gain an understanding of the complete requirements concerning the removal of certain potentially environmentally sensitive materials from our products to comply with the european union directives on restrictions on certain hazardous substances on electrical and electronic equipment rohs and on waste electrical and electronic equipment weee 
some of our customers are requesting that we implement these new compliance standards sooner than the legislation would require 
while we believe that we will have the resources and ability to fully meet our customers requests  and spirit of the rohs and weee directives  if unusual occurrences arise or if we are wrong in our assessment of what it will take to fully comply  there is a risk that we will not be able to meet the aggressive schedule set by our customers or comply with the legislation as passed by the eu member states 
if that were to happen  a material negative effect on our financial results may occur 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the benefit of the services of key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees 
the unanticipated loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
while we believe that we currently have adequate control structures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are working diligently toward evaluating our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls  as required by this legislation 
we are performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result  we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time 
while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory 
table of contents plantronics annual report authorities  such as the securities exchange commission or the new york stock exchange 
any such action could adversely effect our financial results 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the first quarter of calendar year  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of april  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors affecting future operating results 
interest rate risk at march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million at march  at march   we had no marketable securities compared to million at march  cash equivalents have a maturity when purchased of days or less  marketable securities have a maturity of greater than days  but less than one year 
as of march   we were not exposed to significant interest rate risk as all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in securities or interest bearing accounts with maturities of less than days 
the average maturity period for our investments at march  was less than three months 
the taxable equivalent interest rates locked in on those investments averaged 
our investment policy requires that we only invest in deposit accounts  certificates of deposit or commercial paper with minimum ratings of a p and money market mutual funds with minimum ratings of aaa 
we have a revolving credit facility with a major bank for million  including a letter of credit subfacility 
the facility and subfacility both expire on july  as of april  we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility 
the amounts outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility were principally associated with purchases of inventory 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
these covenants may adversely affect us to the extent we cannot comply with them 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under this agreement 
foreign currency exchange rate risk approximately of our fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states  with approximately denominated in foreign currencies  predominately the great british pound and the 
table of contents part ii plantronics annual report euro 
approximately of our fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states  with approximately denominated predominately in the great british pound and the euro 
approximately of fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside the unties states  with approximately denominated in the great british pound and the euro 
during fiscal we did not engage in any hedging activities 
in fiscal  and we engaged in a hedging strategy to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations 
specifically  we hedged our european transaction exposure  hedging both our great british pound and euro positions 
during fiscal  we expanded our hedging activities to include a hedging program to hedge our economic exposure by hedging a portion of euro and great british pound denominated sales 
however  we have no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not materially adversely affect our business in the future 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments and underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates is then subjected to a change in the value of the foreign currency versus the us dollar 
we believe we have no material sensitivity to changes in foreign currency rates on our net exposed financial instrument position

collectively our option contracts hedge against a portion of our forecasted foreign denominated sales 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments and underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency option contracts
