ebitda ebitda represents net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda because it considers such information an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to us  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we also use ebitda for the following purposes 
ebitda is one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
our credit agreement uses ebitda with additional adjustments to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda is also used by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with us 
ebitda is also widely used by the company and other buyers to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
for the year ended december   our ebitda was  compared to  in the prior year 
also  please note that ebitda for the prior year includes credits of  related to the settlement of a dispute with a software licensor 
management believes the improvement in ebitda reflects organic revenue growth combined with the contribution of amquest to our operations for all of ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a principal indicator of our performance 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on its gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally

critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s  which require the selection and application of significant accounting policies  and which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting polices 
revenue recognition our services are provided under a combination of fixed monthly fees and time and materials billings 
contracts with clients typically range from one to five years 
revenue is recognized after we have obtained an executed service contract from the customer as the services are rendered when the price is fixed as per the service contract and when we believe that collectibility is reasonably assured based on the credit risk policies and procedures that we employ 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
tangible and intangible assets we have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet  primarily property and equipment  deferred software costs  and intangible assets  primarily goodwill  related to acquisitions 
the assignment of useful lives to these assets and the valuation and classification of intangible assets involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these tangible and intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
our assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis under the established accounting guidelines 
changes in business conditions or changes in the decisions of management as to how assets will be deployed in our operations could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations
