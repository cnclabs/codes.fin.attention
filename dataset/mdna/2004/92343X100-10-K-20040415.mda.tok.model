industry background actionable intelligence overview verint provides analytic software based solutions to enable customers to generate actionable intelligence from voice  fax  video  email  internet and data transmissions 
the process of generating actionable intelligence is a result of the following five elements collection  retention  analysis  decision and distribution 
collection of raw multimedia information is achieved through an interface with wireline and wireless communications networks  including the internet  business communications infrastructures  closed circuit television  or cctv cameras  as well as cameras with direct connection to ip networks 
retention consists of storage of the collected multimedia information 
collected information can be processed concurrently with its storage 
data can be stored on existing storage facilities including storage area networks sans 
analysis of stored information is performed through various voice  video and data mining techniques  as well as correlation with structured data 
these analytical tools convert raw multimedia information into organized  useful data 
decision criteria are established by users to filter and prioritize processed data 
by applying decision criteria  the processed data becomes actionable intelligence 
distribution of actionable intelligence to the appropriate decision makers is the last component of the multimedia analytic solution 
through automatic alerts  the decision makers are notified of actionable intelligence in a timely manner 
the security and business intelligence markets overview verint s solutions for the security market consist primarily of communications interception solutions used by law enforcement agencies  government agencies and telecommunications carriers  and networked video solutions used by government agencies and public and private organizations for use in airports  public buildings  financial institutions  retail stores  correctional facilities and corporate sites 
verint s solutions for the business intelligence market consist primarily of solutions for enterprises that rely on contact centers for voice  email and internet interactions with their customers 
additionally  an emerging segment of business intelligence utilizes networked video information to allow enterprises and institutions to enhance their operations  processes and performance 
communications interception lawful communications interception is the monitoring and recording of voice and data transmissions to and from a specified target over communications networks in order to obtain intelligence and gather evidence 
law enforcement agencies are typically granted the authority from national and regional government authorities to monitor  record  process and store intercepted transmissions to and from specified targets 
telecommunications carriers in certain countries are mandated by government regulation to ensure that their telecommunications networks satisfy certain technical requirements for channeling intercepted communications to law enforcement authorities 
in addition  certain government agencies worldwide require the ability to monitor and intercept communications for the purpose of ensuring security 
recent legislative  regulatory and technological developments surrounding communications interception activities have led to an increased interest in sophisticated communications interception solutions 
for example  in  the us congress passed the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea  and subsequently  the european telecommunications standards institute  or etsi  adopted similar standards for communications interception 
the purpose of calea and the etsi standards is to ensure that telecommunications carriers are able to fulfill the technical requirements of channeling intercepted transmissions to law enforcement agencies 
although calea was introduced approximately eight years ago  communications service providers were not required to comply with calea s standards until june   and were allowed to individually seek further exemptions 
following the september terrorist attacks  the federal communications commission issued an order stating that no further unilateral exemptions would be granted after december  since then  telecommunications carriers seeking to comply with calea and the etsi standards and communications equipment vendors seeking to provide compliant products have driven the demand for calea and etsi compliant solutions 
verint provides governmental entities  law enforcement agencies and telecommunications carriers with turnkey solutions and subsystems for this security market that are intended to enable them to operate within the legal limits of information monitoring and collection as laws governing electronic surveillance vary significantly by country  and within many countries at the state or provincial levels 
networked video organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for surveillance of their facilities and operations to ensure the proper level of security 
in addition  there is heightened awareness of the security needs of public facilities  including airports and government buildings  as well as other organizations and institutions 
networked video security solutions address some of these security needs by providing a proactive approach to surveillance and security 
traditionally  video security consisted of connecting surveillance cameras to analog monitors and vcr recording equipment that archived video images on tape 
today  digital video technology offers many advantages over analog equipment while allowing for the continued use of the existing infrastructure of installed cameras 
these advantages include more efficient storage of video for faster search and retrieval  either locally or remotely through wireless and wireline ip networks  and the capability to interface with other digital security systems  such as access control and security databases 
additionally  as video data is digitized and compressed  a variety of intelligent video analysis tools can be applied  including advanced motion detection technologies and analysis of the behavior of individuals and objects 
the combination of digital recording and intelligent video analysis technologies provides users with a more effective integrated security and surveillance solution 
networked video security systems are marketed primarily to government agencies and public and private organizations for use in airports  public buildings  financial institutions  retail stores  correctional facilities and corporate sites that require the capture  retention and analysis of video information for crime prevention and investigation  asset protection and other related purposes 
an emerging segment of business intelligence utilizes networked video information to allow enterprises and institutions to enhance their operations  processes and performance 
traditional video security and surveillance systems allow enterprises to view and record actions and behaviors associated with security related or criminal activity  however  information on the actions  behaviors and interactions of personnel or customers of an enterprise is also valuable 
the existing infrastructure of closed circuit television cameras often already captures much of this valuable operational information  but utilizing information recorded by analog recording systems is impractical 
the expansion of digital recording and the introduction of intelligent video analysis tools allow an enterprise to easily access and utilize this valuable operational information 
implementing video business intelligence applications can offer valuable information and process improvements to businesses in many vertical markets 
some of the applications for video business intelligence include the counting  categorizing  point of sale reporting  monitoring and assessment of customer and personnel activities 
for example  in the retail market  condensing and reviewing in store activities  businesses can analyze and adjust staffing and product placement based on observed activities 
likewise  comparisons can also be made of similar activities among several stores 
utilizing these business intelligence applications can improve customer service  enhance customer employee safety  increase product sales and improve the efficiency of business operations 
contact center actionable intelligence developing and maintaining long term customer relationships is critical to the success of an enterprise operating in the competitive global marketplace 
however  to understand and enhance customer relations  an enterprise must first improve its business processes that involve a high degree of direct customer interaction 
today  many organizations interact with their customers or clients primarily through contact centers 
increasingly  the contact center is the primary hub within an organization for inbound or outbound communications with customers 
contact centers generally consist of supervisor and agent workstations that are staffed with customer service representatives and are connected to a central telephone switch as well as database management systems that capture  store and report relevant customer information 
the company believes that solutions that automate and evaluate key sales  marketing and customer service processes  improve the effectiveness of customer interactions and aid in the retention of contact center agents will become increasingly important 
as customers continue to interact with customer service representatives through multiple communication channels including the internet  the role and importance of recording and quality assurance for contact centers is increasing 
additionally  the rapid growth of the internet and electronic commerce has also increased the importance companies place on their customer relationships  since the consumers can easily evaluate products and prices from a wide range of geographically dispersed vendors and quickly change vendors at a relatively low cost 
enterprises across industries are being driven to purchase quality assurance software primarily to improve customer care  as well as to comply with industry specific regulations 
in addition  due to the high cost of agent training and the high turnover of contact center agents  the retention of contact center agents has become a high priority for many enterprises 
contact center actionable intelligence solutions target enterprises that rely on contact centers for voice  email and internet interactions with their customers 
actionable intelligence generated from such interactions helps these enterprises to better service and retain customers  improve business processes and optimize contact center agent performance and retention 
companies possessing a better understanding of the characteristics and preferences of their customers are better positioned to customize product and service offerings for increased sales and enhanced customer retention 
in addition  these companies will also be able to better identify opportunities to sell complementary or higher end products and to more accurately forecast customer demand 
for example  major financial institutions generally and credit card issuers particularly  need to monitor contact center activity in real time to ensure that contact center representatives are responsive to customer needs  and assure that customers do not cancel accounts or transfer balances based on poor service 
additionally  increased intelligence allows these companies to identify new business opportunities with customers  such as cross selling other financial services and products  including investments  insurance and mortgages  to existing credit card customers

the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and often require the exercise of substantial judgment based on historical experience and other factors 
in addition  while the company has used its best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to it at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used by the company are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of verint s financial condition and results of operations 
the company reviews these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of revisions  if any  in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates

the company recognizes revenue from these maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period 
the company recognizes revenue from certain long term contracts under the percentage of completion method on the basis of physical completion or using actual costs incurred relative to total expected costs under the contract 
revisions in estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require such revision become known 
at the time a loss on a contract is known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is accrued 
amounts received from customers in excess of revenues earned are recorded as advance payments from customers 
accounts receivable are generally diversified due to the number of commercial and government entities comprising verint s customer base and their dispersion across many geographical regions

the company reviews software development costs for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

certain trends and uncertainties the company s primary business is providing analytic solutions for communications interception  networked video security  and networked video and contact center business intelligence 
recent legislative and regulatory actions have provided greater surveillance powers to law enforcement agencies  imposed strict requirements on communications service providers to facilitate interception of communications over public networks  and increased the security measures being implemented at public facilities such as airports 
however  the company cannot be assured that these legislative and regulatory actions will result in increased demand for or purchasing of solutions such as those offered by the company or  if it does  that such solutions will be purchased from the company 
if demand for or purchasing of the company s solutions does not increase as anticipated  the company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is difficult for the company to forecast the timing of revenues from product sales because customers often need a significant amount of time to evaluate its products before purchasing them and  in the case of governmental customers  sales are dependent on budgetary and other bureaucratic processes 
the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from three months to more than one year 
during the evaluation period  customers may defer or scale down proposed orders of the company s products for various reasons  including i changes in budgets and purchasing priorities  ii reduced need to upgrade existing systems  iii deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  iv introduction of products by its competitors  and v lower prices offered by its competitors 
the company faces aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of its business  and many of its customers make decisions to purchase based largely on price considerations 
the company may have to lower the prices of many of its products and services to stay competitive  while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin 
if the company cannot proportionately decrease its cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures  its margin and therefore its profitability could be adversely affected 
further  the company invests a significant amount into research and development  which the company views as necessary to its long term competitiveness 
if  to decrease its cost structure  the company reduces its investment in research and development  the company may adversely impact its long term competitiveness in an effort to maintain or improve its revenue  income and gross margin in the short term 
in addition  if the company s pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive  or if there is an adverse reaction to its product decisions  it may lose market share in certain areas  which could adversely affect its revenue and prospects 
even if verint is able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product  revenue could decline due to increased competition from other types of products or because the product is in a maturing industry 
the company derives a significant amount of its revenues from various government contracts worldwide 
the company expects that government contracts will continue to be a significant source of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s business generated from government contracts may be materially and adversely affected if i its reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired  ii it is suspended or otherwise prohibited from contracting with a domestic or foreign government or any significant law enforcement agency  iii levels of government expenditures and authorizations for law enforcement and security related programs decrease  remain constant or shift to programs in areas where it does not provide products and services  iv it is prevented from entering into new government contracts or extending existing government contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  including those related to procurement  v it is not granted security clearances that are required to sell its products to domestic or foreign governments or such security clearances are revoked  or vi there is a change in government procurement procedures 
the company s quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future  which in turn may result in volatility in its stock price 
the following factors  among others  many of which are outside its control  can cause fluctuations in operating results and stock price volatility i the size  timing  terms and conditions of orders from and shipments to its customers  ii unanticipated delays or problems in releasing new products  iii the timing and success of its customers deployment of its products and services  and iv the amount and timing of its investments in research and development activities 
while verint has no single customer that is material  verint has many significant customers and receives multi million dollar orders from time to time 
the deferral or loss of one or more significant orders or a delay in an expected implementation of such an order could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results in any fiscal quarter  particularly if there are significant sales and marketing expenses associated with the deferred  lost or delayed sales 
the company bases its current and future expense levels on its internal operating plans and sales forecasts  and its operating costs are  to a large extent  fixed 
as a result  the company may not be able to sufficiently reduce its costs in any quarter to compensate for an unexpected near term shortfall in revenues 
verint has continued to expand its gross margins as a result of reducing hardware as a part of its product offerings 
this gross margin expansion has contributed to the growth of verint s net income at a rate greater than the growth of its revenue 
verint s ability to continue to expand gross margins in this manner is largely contingent upon customers obtaining the hardware necessary to operate verint s software solutions from another vendor 
if customers insist that verint provide a turnkey solution  including all necessary hardware  verint may not be able to continue to expand gross margins at the rate that it has or at all  which would reduce the rate of growth of verint s net income 
if the rate of growth of verint s net income is reduced  it could materially and adversely affect the share price of verint s stock 
the market for the company s business intelligence products has been adversely affected by the global economic slowdown and the decline in information technology spending  which has caused many companies to reduce or  in extreme cases  eliminate altogether  information technology spending 
while there exists some evidence in the market that information technology spending is increasing  the information technology spending of its customers in the near term remains uncertain and the company is uncertain whether it will be able to increase or maintain its revenues 
although the company was profitable for fiscal and  it has incurred operating and net losses every other year since if sales do not increase as anticipated or if expenses increase at a greater pace than revenues  the company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the markets for the company s security and business intelligence products are still emerging 
the company s growth is dependent on  among other things  the size and pace at which the markets for its products develop 
if the markets for its products decrease  remain constant or grow slower than the company anticipates  the company will not be able to maintain its growth 
continued growth in the demand for the company s products is uncertain as  among other reasons  its existing customers and potential customers may i not achieve a return on their investment in its products  ii experience technical difficulty in utilizing its products  or iii use alternative solutions to achieve their security  intelligence or business objectives 
in addition  as the company s enterprise business intelligence products are sold primarily to contact centers  slower than anticipated growth or a contraction in the number of contact centers will have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain its growth 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards can render the company s existing products obsolete and unmarketable and can exert price pressures on existing products 
it is critical to the company s success for it to be able to anticipate changes in technology or in industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new  enhanced and competitive products on a timely basis 
the company cannot be assured that it will successfully develop new products or introduce new applications for existing products  that new products and applications will achieve market acceptance or that the introduction of new products or technological developments by its competitors will not render its products obsolete 
the company s inability to develop products that are competitive in technology and price and meet customer needs could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the global market for analytical solutions for security and business applications is intensely competitive  both in the number and breadth of competing companies and products and the manner in which products are sold 
for example  the company often competes for customer contracts through a competitive bidding process that subjects it to risks associated with i the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns  and ii the substantial time and effort  including design  development and marketing activities  required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to the company 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated by sales made through strategic and technology partners  distributors  value added resellers and systems integrators 
in addition  many of these sales channels also partner with the company s competitors and may even offer the products of company and its competitors when presenting bids to certain customers 
the company s ability to achieve revenue growth depends to some extent on maintaining and adding to these sales channels 
if the company s relationships with these sales channels deteriorate or terminate  the company may lose important sales and marketing opportunities 
the company s competitors may be able to develop more quickly or adapt faster to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
some of the company s competitors have  in relation to it  longer operating histories  larger customer bases  longer standing relationships with customers  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  public relations  distribution and other resources 
new competitors continue to emerge and there continues to be consolidation among existing competitors which may reduce the company s market share 
in addition  some of the company s customers may in the future decide to develop internally their own solutions instead of purchasing them from the company 
increased competition could force the company to lower its prices or take other actions to differentiate its products 
on march   the company completed its million acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of ectel ltd 
comprising its communications interception business 
this business posted significant losses for fiscal  as well as significant reduction in revenues from fiscal to fiscal in addition  the integration of this business into the company s business is going to require a significant amount of management time and attention 
further  the revenues from this business are concentrated in a few customers 
additionally  this business has technology  including in process r d  which will have to be integrated with the company s product offerings 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate this business into the company s communications interception business  including operations  research and development  facilities and related matters retain and integrate employees joining the company with the acquired business  including maintaining employee morale continue to successfully operate its own business while management time and attention is diverted to integrating this business improve upon the financial results of this business  or even perform as well  or that this business will not materially and adversely affect the company s financial results integrate the technology of this business or complete the in process r d ensure that the customers of this business or the company s own customers will be confident in the company s ability to adequately deliver products and services 
many of the company s government contracts contain provisions that give the governments party to those contracts rights and remedies not typically found in private commercial contracts  including provisions enabling the governments to i terminate or cancel existing contracts for convenience  ii in the case of the us government  suspend the company from doing business with a foreign government or prevent the company from selling its products in certain countries  iii audit and object to it s the company s contract related costs and expenses  including allocated indirect costs  and iv change specific terms and conditions in its contracts  including changes that would reduce the value of its contracts 
in addition  many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that deem government contracts in those jurisdictions to include these types of provisions  even if the contract itself does not contain them 
if a government terminates a contract with the company for convenience  the company may not recover its incurred or committed costs  any settlement expenses or profit on work completed prior to the termination 
if a government terminates a contract for default  the company may not recover those amounts  and  in addition  it may be liable for any costs incurred by a government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source 
the company must comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how the company does business with government agencies in various countries and may impose added costs on its business 
for example  in the united states the company is subject to the federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts  and to the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations 
the company is subject to similar regulations in foreign countries as well 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies  which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a government may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair the company s ability to obtain new contracts 
the company s products are often used by customers to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information and data  including information or data used in intelligence gathering or law enforcement activities 
the company may come into contact with such information or data when it performs support or maintenance functions for its customers 
while it has internal policies  procedures and training for employees in connection with performing these functions  even the perception that any of its employees has improperly handled sensitive or confidential information and data of a customer could harm its reputation and could inhibit market acceptance of its products 
the company s subsidiary  verint technology inc verint technology which markets  sells and supports its communications interception solutions to various us government agencies  is required by the national industrial security program to maintain facility security clearances and to be insulated from foreign ownership  control or influence 
to comply with the national industrial security program requirements  in january the company  verint technology  comverse technology and the department of defense entered into a proxy agreement with respect to the ownership and operations of verint technology  which agreement was superceded in may to comply with the department of defense s most recent requirements 
under the proxy agreement  the company  among other things  appointed three individuals who are us citizens holding the requisite security clearances as holders of proxies to vote the verint technology stock 
the proxy holders have the power to exercise all prerogatives of ownership of verint technology 
these three individuals are responsible for the oversight of verint technology s security arrangements 
the proxy agreement may be terminated and verint technology s facility security clearance may be revoked in the event of a breach of the proxy agreement  or if it is determined by the department of defense that termination is in the national interest 
if verint technology s facility security clearance is revoked  the company may lose all or a substantial portion of its sales to us government agencies and its business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  concerns about the security of the company or its products can materially and adversely affect verint technology s sales to us government agencies 
as the communications industry continues to evolve  governments may increasingly regulate products that monitor and record voice  video and data transmissions over public communications networks  such as the company s solutions 
for example  products which the company sells in the united states to law enforcement agencies and which interface with a variety of wireline  wireless and internet protocol networks  must comply with the technical standards established by the federal communications commission pursuant to the communications assistance for law enforcement act and products that it sells in europe must comply with the technical standards established by the european telecommunications standard institute 
the adoption of new laws governing the use of the company s products or changes made to existing laws could cause a decline in the use of its products and could result in increased expenses for the company  particularly if it is required to modify or redesign its products to accommodate these new or changing laws 
the company is required to obtain export licenses from the israeli and german governments to export some of its products that it develops or manufactures in these countries 
the company cannot be assured that it will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the licenses and other authorizations required to export its products from applicable governmental authorities 
the company s failure to receive or maintain any required export license or authorization would hinder its ability to sell its products and could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
as part of the company s growth strategy  it intends to pursue new strategic alliances 
the company considers and engages in strategic transactions from time to time and may be evaluating alliances or joint ventures at any time 
the company competes with other analytic solution providers for these opportunities 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to effect these transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the company enters into these transactions  it also cannot be sure that it will realize the benefits it anticipates 
the company s products involve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards 
the company cannot be assured that current or future products will not develop operational problems  which could have a material adverse effect on it 
the company offers complex products that may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the company may not discover such defects or errors until after a product has been released and used by the customer 
significant costs may be incurred to correct undetected defects or errors in the company s products and these defects or errors could result in future lost sales 
in addition  defects or errors in the company s products may result in product liability claims  which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance 
the company incorporates in the vast majority of its products software that it licenses from third parties 
if the company loses or is unable to maintain any software licenses  it could incur additional costs or experience unexpected delays until equivalent software can be developed or licensed and integrated into its products 
while the company occasionally files patent applications  it cannot be assured that patents will be issued on the basis of such applications or that  if such patents are issued  they will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology 
in addition  the company cannot be assured that any patents issued to it will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in order to safeguard its unpatented proprietary know how  trade secrets and technology  the company relies primarily upon trade secret protection and non disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others having access to confidential information 
the company cannot be assured that these measures will adequately protect it from improper disclosure or misappropriation of its proprietary information 
while the company implements sophisticated security measures  third parties may attempt to breach its security or inappropriately use its products through computer viruses  electronic break ins and other disruptions 
if successful  confidential information  including passwords  financial information  or other personal information may be improperly obtained and the company may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
even if the company is not held liable  such security breaches could harm its reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of its products with both government and commercial purchasers 
the information technology industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement 
in the past  third parties have asserted that certain of the company s products infringe their intellectual property and similar claims may be made in the future 
any allegation of infringement against the company could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve  result in substantial diversion of management resources  cause product shipment delays  or force it to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation 
if patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings against the company  it may be forced into protracted and costly litigation 
the company may not be successful in defending such litigation and it may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to it  or at all 
the company generally indemnifies its customers with respect to infringement by its products of the proprietary rights of third parties 
third parties may assert infringement claims against the company s customers 
these claims may require the company to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  the company may be forced to pay damages or may be required to obtain licenses for the products its customers use 
if the company cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  its customers may be forced to stop using  or  in the case of value added resellers  selling  its products 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components in its products  it does use some non standard parts and equipment 
the company relies on non affiliated suppliers for the supply of certain standard and non standard components and on manufacturers of assemblies that are incorporated in all of its products 
the company does not have long term supply or manufacturing agreements with all of these suppliers and manufacturers 
if these suppliers or manufacturers experience financial  operational  manufacturing capacity or quality assurance difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in its relationships with these suppliers or manufacturers  the company will be required to locate alternative sources of supply 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components  if and as required in the future  entails the following risks i delays in delivery or shortages in components could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for its products  ii alternative suppliers could increase component prices significantly and with immediate effect  iii it may not be able to develop alternative sources for product components  iv it may be required to modify its products  which may cause delays in product shipments  increased manufacturing costs and increased product prices  and v it may be required to hold more inventory than it otherwise might in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance 
the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or the establishment of joint venture arrangements 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures as well as the integration of an acquired or jointly developed business  technology or product could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets  research and development write offs and other acquisition related expenses 
these investments may be made in immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies 
such investments have a high degree of risk  with the possibility that the company may lose the total amount of its investments  or more than its total investment if such businesses have liabilities not identified by the company 
the company may not be able to identify suitable investment candidates  and  even if it does  it may not be able to make those investments on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company also may fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses with its operations or successfully realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  the company may find the value of its acquired technologies and related intangible assets  such as goodwill  as recorded in its financial statements  to be impaired  resulting in charges to operations 
the company may also fail to retain the acquired or merged company s key employees and customers 
the company depends on the continued services of its executive officers and other key personnel 
in addition  the company may need to attract and retain a substantial number of new employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel and technical personnel  who understand and have experience with its products and services 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees  its ability to grow could be impaired 
competition for personnel for certain positions in the company s industry is intense  and in the past the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel due to the market demand for their services 
the company has also experienced difficulty in locating qualified candidates within desired geographic locations and on occasion it has had to relocate personnel to fill positions in locations where it could not attract qualified experienced personnel 
the company conducts significant sales and research and development operations in foreign countries  including israel  germany  the united kingdom and canada  and it intends to continue to expand its operations internationally 
the company s business may suffer if it is unable to successfully expand and maintain foreign operations 
the company s foreign operations are  and any future foreign expansion will be  subject to a variety of risks  many of which are beyond its control  including risks associated with i foreign currency fluctuations  ii customizing products for foreign countries  iii political and economic instability in foreign countries  iv potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries  v legal uncertainties regarding liability  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  vi compliance with local laws and regulations  including labor laws  employee benefits  currency restrictions and other requirements  vii hiring qualified foreign employees  and viii difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods 
to date  most of the company s sales have been denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of its expenses  primarily labor expenses in israel  germany  the united kingdom and canada  are incurred in the local currencies of these countries 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar could increase  the dollar cost of its operations in israel  germany  the united kingdom and canada  and would therefore have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
in addition  since a portion of the company s sales are made in foreign currencies  primarily the british pound and the euro  fluctuation in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar could decrease its revenues and materially and adversely affect its results of operations 
in addition  the company s costs of operations have at times been negatively affected by changes in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting from changes in the value of the new israeli shekel relative to the us dollar 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and the continued state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
while israel has signed peace accords with both egypt and jordan  since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip  and israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders 
during this period  negotiations between israel and representatives of the palestinian authority have been sporadic and have failed to result in peace 
the company could be materially and adversely affected by hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
in addition  the sale of products manufactured in israel may be materially and adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of violence in israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts involving israel may impede the company s ability to sell its products and may otherwise materially and adversely affect it 
in addition  many of the company s israeli employees are required to perform annual compulsory military reserve duty in israel and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
the absence of these employees may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company receives conditional grants from the government of israel through the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade  or the ocs  for the financing of a portion of its research and development expenditures in israel 
the terms of these conditional grants limit the company s ability to manufacture products  and prohibit it from transferring technologies  outside of israel if such products or technologies were developed using these grants 
even if the company receives approval to manufacture products developed using these conditional grants outside of israel  it may be required to pay a significantly increased amount of royalties on an accelerated basis to the government of israel  depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of israel 
this restriction may impair the company s ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangements for those products or technologies 
in addition  if the company fails to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the ocs  it may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties  and it may be subject to criminal charges 
in recent years  the government of israel has accelerated the rate of repayment of ocs grants and may further accelerate them in the future 
the company currently pays royalties of between and or under certain circumstances of associated product revenues including service and other related revenues to the government of israel for repayment of benefits received under this program 
such royalty payments by the company are currently required to be made until the government has been reimbursed the amounts received by it  linked to the us dollar  plus  for amounts received under projects approved by the ocs after january   interest on such amounts at a rate equal to the month libor rate in effect on january of the year in which approval is obtained 
as of january   the company has received approximately million in cumulative grants and has recorded approximately million in cumulative royalties to the ocs 
further  the government of israel has reduced the benefits available under these programs in recent years and these programs may be discontinued or curtailed in the future 
in addition  the company expects that ocs grants as a percentage of its consolidated research and development expenses will decrease in future periods due to an expected increase in the portion of research and development activities that will not be reimbursed by the ocs and an expected increase in research and development activities outside of israel 
the continued reduction in these benefits or the termination of the company s eligibility to receive these benefits may materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s investment programs in manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements at its facility in israel have been granted approved enterprise status and it is therefore eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments 
the government of israel may reduce or eliminate the tax benefits available to approved enterprise programs such as the programs provided to the company 
the company cannot be assured that these tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
if these tax benefits are reduced or eliminated  the amount of taxes that the company pays in israel will increase 
in addition  if the company fails to comply with any of the conditions and requirements of the investment programs  the tax benefits it has received may be rescinded and it may be required to refund the amounts it received as a result of the tax benefits  together with interest and penalties 
comverse technology beneficially owns a majority of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  comverse technology effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including the composition of the company s board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
through its representation on the company s board of directors  comverse technology has a controlling influence on the company s management  direction and policies  including the ability to appoint and remove its officers 
as a result  comverse technology may cause the company to take actions which may not be aligned with the company s interests or those of its other stockholders 
for example  comverse technology may prevent or delay any transaction involving a change in control or in which stockholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares 
the company receives insurance  legal and certain administrative services from comverse technology under a corporate services agreement 
the company s enterprise resource planning software is maintained and supported by comverse  ltd  a subsidiary of comverse technology  under an enterprise resource planning software sharing agreement 
the company also obtains personnel and facility services from comverse  inc under a satellite services agreement 
if these agreements are terminated  the company may be required to obtain similar services from other entities or  alternatively  it may be required to hire qualified personnel and incur other expenses to obtain these services 
the company may not be able to hire such personnel or to obtain comparable services at prices and on terms as favorable as it currently has under these agreements 
the company has entered into a business opportunities agreement with comverse technology that addresses potential conflicts of interest between comverse technology and the company 
this agreement allocates between comverse technology and the company opportunities to pursue transactions or matters that  absent such allocation  could constitute corporate opportunities of both companies 
as a result  the company may lose valuable business opportunities 
in general  the company is precluded from pursuing opportunities offered to officers or employees of comverse technology who may also be its directors  officers or employees unless comverse technology fails to pursue these opportunities 
seven of the company s thirteen directors are officers and or directors or employees of comverse technology  or otherwise affiliated with comverse technology 
these directors have fiduciary duties to both companies and may have conflicts of interest on matters affecting both the company and comverse technology and in some circumstances may have interests adverse to the company 
the company s chairman  kobi alexander  is the chairman of comverse technology 
this position with comverse technology imposes significant demands on mr 
alexander s time and presents potential conflicts of interest 
prior to the company s initial public offering in may  it was included in the comverse technology consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and did not file its own federal income tax return 
following the company s initial public offering  it ceased to be included in the comverse technology consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent comverse technology or other members of the group fail to make any federal income tax payments required of them by law in respect of years for which comverse technology filed a consolidated federal income tax return which included the company  the company would be liable for the shortfall 
similar principles apply for state income tax purposes in many states 
in addition  by virtue of its controlling ownership and its tax sharing agreement with the company  comverse technology effectively controls all of the company s tax decisions for periods ending prior to the completion of its initial public offering 
for periods during which the company was included in the comverse technology consolidated group for federal income tax purposes  comverse technology has sole authority to respond to and conduct all federal income tax proceedings and audits relating to the company  to file all federal income tax returns on its behalf and to determine the amount of its liability to  or entitlement to payment from  comverse technology under its tax sharing agreement 
despite this agreement  federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group s entire tax obligation and the company could  under certain circumstances  be liable for taxes of other members of the comverse technology consolidated group 
the trading price of the company s shares of common stock has been affected by the factors disclosed in this section as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
share prices of companies in technology related industries  such as the company s  tend to exhibit a high degree of volatility 
the announcement of financial results that fall short of the results anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant negative effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of its sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to the volatility of the trading value of the company s shares regardless of its long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in its industry generally  and its business segment in particular  which may not have any direct relationship with its business or prospects 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
the company could be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in the expenditure of substantial costs  divert management s attention and resources  harm the company s reputation in the industry and the securities markets and reduce its profitability 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war  and any response to them  may lead to armed hostilities and such developments would likely cause instability in financial markets 
armed hostilities and terrorism may directly impact the company s facilities  personnel and operations which are located in the united states  israel  europe  the far east  australia and south america  as well as those of its clients 
furthermore  severe terrorist attacks or acts of war may result in temporary halts of commercial activity in the affected regions  and may result in reduced demand for its products 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and the trading price of its common stock 
the company s board of directors ability to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to issue additional shares of common stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  and could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire  or could discourage a person from seeking to acquire  control of the company 
if this occurs  investors could lose the opportunity to receive a premium on the sale of their shares in a change of control transaction 
forward looking statements from time to time  the company makes forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include financial projections  statements of plans and objectives for future operations  statements of future economic performance  and statements of assumptions relating thereto 
the company may include forward looking statements in its periodic reports to the securities and exchange commission on forms k  q  and k  in its annual report to shareholders  in its proxy statements  in its press releases  in other written materials  and in statements made by employees to analysts  investors  representatives of the media  and others 
by their very nature  forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties  both general and specific  and risks exist those predictions  forecasts  projections and other forward looking statements will not be achieved 
actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors  including without limitation those discussed under certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in this report 
investors and others should carefully consider these and other uncertainties and events  whether or not the statements are described as forward looking 
forward looking statements made by the company are intended to apply only at the time they are made  unless explicitly stated to the contrary 
moreover  whether or not stated in connection with a forward looking statement  the company undertakes no obligation to correct or update a forward looking statement should the company later become aware that it is not likely to be achieved 
if the company were in any particular instance to update or correct a forward looking statement  investors and others should not conclude that the company would make additional updates or corrections thereafter 
item a
