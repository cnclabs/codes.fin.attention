our strategy for long term  sustainable growth in revenue and net income is focused on achieving a leadership position within the plm market by effectively enabling our customers to achieve measurable improvements in their business by unifying and streamlining processes across the product lifecycle 
currently  there are three key elements to our growth strategy improving sales execution  upgrading our installed base of customers to matrix and extending our position in key industrial markets 
we are intensely focused on improving all elements of company wide sales execution 
we have implemented a common  disciplined selling process in all regions of the world  which we believe will lead to improved visibility of future revenue opportunities and improved accuracy in revenue forecasting 
we are increasingly working more effectively with our global alliance partners whom we depend on to deliver the comprehensive needs of our global customer base 
in may  we introduced matrix  a comprehensive and flexible plm environment that consists of three components the matrix plm platform  business process applications and our enterprise integration products 
matrix includes significant enhancements in security  scalability  and interoperability compared to previous releases of our product offerings 
because many of our existing customers operate with previous releases of our products  we believe that there are opportunities to grow software license and professional services revenue by effectively upgrading our installed base of customers to matrix  which may result in the licensing of additional 
table of contents software products and the commencement of additional professional services engagements both during and after the upgrade 
we license our plm solutions primarily in eight industrial markets including aerospace and defense  automotive  consumer products  financial services  machinery  high technology  medical devices  and the process industries 
to gain market leadership in each of these industrial markets  a core part of our growth strategy is to develop and market focused variations of our core product offerings to meet the needs of industry specific business processes  develop the deep domain expertise of our workforce in the industrial markets in which we compete  and develop and leverage alliance partnerships with key system integration partners  original equipment manufacturers  and complementary hardware and software providers 
we also plan to leverage our unique strengths in the broader electronics market  which transcends several of the vertical markets in which we compete including medical devices  where electronics has become the competitive differentiator for many key industry products such as imaging and monitoring equipment  aerospace and defense  where electronics  such as computing and communications systems are key drivers  and automotive  where electronics are quickly becoming a major part of the value chain 
our strategy to exploit this opportunity in the electronics market was strengthened with our acquisition in august of synchronicity due to the enhancement of our position in the semiconductor industry  which is the engine of the global electronics market 
together with synchronicity  we expect to bring unique solutions to companies involved in electronic design 
as a result of our acquisition of synchronicity  our unique partnerships with cadence  ibm and intel  and our strong position with many of the world s most innovative high tech companies  we believe we are better positioned for growth in the global electronics market 
financial overview we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services through our offices in the united states  canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore and the netherlands and indirectly through our alliance partner network throughout europe and asia pacific 
revenues by geographic region fluctuate each period based on the timing  size and number of software license and professional services transactions and fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
we expect our revenues by geographic region to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our total revenues by major geographic region  including exports into such regions  for fiscal  and were as follows year ended in thousands july  june  june  north america europe asia pacific our international subsidiaries generally invoice their customers and pay their employees and suppliers in local currency 
therefore  our revenues and expenses from these international subsidiaries  when translated to us dollars  are subject to foreign currency risk 
we currently do not enter into contracts or agreements to minimize our exposure to the effects of changes in foreign currency when the results of our international subsidiaries are translated to us dollars 
accordingly  if the dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies  our revenues and expenses would increase when stated in us dollars 
conversely  if the dollar strengthens  our revenues and expenses would decrease 
if the revenues from our international subsidiaries for fiscal had 
table of contents been translated at exchange rates for the comparable period a year ago  our total revenues would have been million lower 
as a result of disappointing financial results for the three months ended september  and continued weakness in information technology spending and global economic conditions and the related impact on our business  in october  we implemented a restructuring program to further reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with current and projected market conditions and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this restructuring program primarily included a reduction in workforce of employees across all functions and locations and the closure and consolidation of certain offices 
in addition  in conjunction with this restructuring program  we evaluated the recoverability of certain of our assets and determined that certain capitalized software  office equipment and leasehold improvements would not be recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded asset impairment and disposal charges of million 
since october  we have implemented several restructuring programs to adjust our operations and cost structure as a result of the weak information technology market and general global economic conditions 
as a result of these programs  we have reduced our workforce from a high of employees as of september  to employees as of july  however  the cost savings resulting from our restructuring programs have been offset in part by increased expenses due to the strengthening of major foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products  market  license  sell  implement and support our products and services  and maintain an infrastructure to support our global operations 
these costs have historically exceeded our total revenues 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
if our operating expenses are higher than we anticipate or our revenues are lower than projected  we may incur significant net losses in fiscal and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments  which we evaluate on an on going basis  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following sets forth the most important accounting policies we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and those that affect our more significant estimates and judgments  which have been reviewed by our disclosure committee  consisting primarily of our senior management team  and the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
we execute separate contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license and maintenance arrangement and each professional services arrangement 
these contracts may be an element in a multiple element arrangement 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products or services sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method 
we use the residual method when fair value does not exist for one of the delivered elements in an arrangement 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in 
table of contents arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training or maintenance and customer support services 
we recognize software license revenues upon execution of a signed software license agreement  delivery of the software to a customer and determination that collection of a fixed license fee is probable 
for delivery over the internet  the software license is considered delivered when the customer is provided access to the software files 
in accordance with our agreements with our value added resellers and distributors alliance partners  an alliance partner has the right to license our software to its customers end users 
therefore  we have no obligation to the alliance partner s end users 
accordingly  we recognize software license revenues from an alliance partner upon receipt of a written confirmation from the alliance partner of a noncancellable  binding written arrangement with the ultimate end user and delivery of the software to the alliance partner 
we recognize revenue from software subscription arrangements ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
fees from revenue sharing  royalty and subscriber arrangements with and through third parties are recognized as revenue when they are fixed and determinable  generally upon receipt of a statement from the third party 
service revenues include professional services  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  training and maintenance and customer support fees 
professional services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements in an arrangement and are accounted for separately 
professional services revenues are primarily derived from time and material contracts and are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services revenues for fixed price contracts are recognized using a concept of proportional performance based upon the ratio of direct labor costs to expected labor costs 
if conditions for acceptance are required  professional services revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
our customers generally reimburse us for the majority of our out of pocket expenses incurred during the course of an engagement 
we do not mark up or add additional fees to the actual out of pocket expenses we incur 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
for arrangements that include the licensing of software and the performance of professional services under a fixed price contract  both the software license revenues and professional services revenues are recognized using a concept of proportional performance based upon the ratio of direct labor costs to expected labor costs 
maintenance and customer support fees include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis and ongoing technical support 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  generally one year  on a straight line basis 
when a maintenance and customer support fee is included in a software license fee  we allocate a portion of the software license fee to maintenance and customer support fees based on the renewal rate of maintenance and customer support fees 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically assess the collectibility of customer accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from uncollectible customer accounts receivable 
in estimating this allowance  we consider customer specific factors such as historical collection experience  current credit worthiness  the aggregate amount due  age of the receivable and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we also consider factors such as the overall balance and aging of our accounts receivable  as well as customer and geographic concentrations 
actual customer collections could differ materially from our estimates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a materially different allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as a result of lower total revenues and accounts receivable and improvement in the aging of our accounts receivable and the days of our sales outstanding as compared to past fiscal periods  we revised our estimate of doubtful accounts and as a result decreased our allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts by million during fiscal our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at july  and june   respectively 
prepaid software royalty fees prepaid software royalty fees  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  are paid to third party software developers under contractual arrangements for technology integrated into certain of our business process applications and enterprise integration products 
amortization of prepaid software royalty fees commences when the software is available for general release 
we amortize prepaid software royalty fees to cost of software license revenues based on the greater of the actual royalties incurred to date or the straight line method of amortization over the estimated useful life of the software product  which is generally two or three years 
management regularly reviews the valuation of each prepaid software royalty fee in order to determine if events and circumstances may require a change in such valuation to reflect the estimated recoverable amount 
prepaid software royalty fees aggregated million and million at july  and june   respectively 
due to the inability of two partners to successfully perform in accordance with the related product development agreements  during fiscal we terminated two product development agreements for certain business process applications for which we had previously paid and capitalized prepaid software royalty fees 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to cost of software license revenues of million 
property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment  and we record depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment 
we regularly review our estimate of the useful lives and net book value of our property and equipment in order to determine if events and circumstances  such as changes in technology  product obsolescence and changes in our business  may require a change in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment or recognition of an impairment loss  both of which would increase our operating expenses 
as a result of our restructuring program in october  we evaluated the recoverability of certain of our assets 
based on this evaluation  we determined that certain assets would not be recoverable  and we recorded asset impairment and disposal charges of million in fiscal for additional information regarding this impairment charge  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
deferred tax assets under applicable accounting criteria  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the estimated amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
during our assessment of the valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies on a consolidated basis and in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the fact it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and may adjust the valuation allowance based on such analysis 
for additional information regarding our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
software license and professional services warranty we generally provide a day warranty on our software products 
our software products are generally warranted to perform in all material aspects as described in the applicable software product documentation and the media in which the software is delivered is warranted to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use 
to date  our software product warranty expense has not been material 

table of contents our professional services are generally warranted to be performed in a workmanlike manner 
in the event the customer requests the work be corrected  we generally will provide these additional professional services at no charge to comply with our warranty obligations and to ensure customer satisfaction 
we estimate our professional services warranty liability based on historical activity 
warranty expense is included in cost of services 
if our actual warranty activities differ from these estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and result in additional charges to cost of services 
we primarily satisfy our warranty obligations by providing in kind services

the october 
table of contents restructuring program was substantially completed during fiscal  and the remaining cash payments were made during fiscal october restructuring program as a result of unfavorable global economic conditions and a reduction in information technology spending around the world and the related impact on our business  in october we implemented a restructuring program to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions the october restructuring program

the october restructuring program included a reduction in workforce of employees  consisting of employees in cost of service revenues  employees in selling and marketing  employees in research and development and eight employees in general and administration 
the costs related to the reduction in workforce include severance and fringe benefits 
in the restructuring program  we also terminated the services of independent contractors 
there were no incremental costs to the company related to the termination of the services of these independent contractors 
the october restructuring program also included facility and lease costs related to the closure of certain excess facilities and activities that we have exited and the termination of certain automotive lease contracts 
as a result of the october restructuring program  we canceled certain contracts related to terminated activities and programs that were either non cancelable or cancelable with penalty provisions

table of contents other income expense 
year ended increase decrease percentage increase decrease in thousands june  june  other income expense  net other income decreased primarily due to a million decrease in interest income from lower yields on our investments resulting from a significant decrease in market interest rates and lower levels of cash available for investment  offset by a slight decrease in other expense  which included losses on disposals of fixed assets in fiscal provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of related to minimum taxes due in certain domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue from licensing our software and providing related services  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs and net assets 
a decrease in the demand for our software and related services or unanticipated increases in our operating costs would likely have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash generated from operations 
the following sets forth information relating to our liquidity as of increase decrease percentage increase decrease in thousands july  june  cash and cash equivalents working capital during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to our loss from operations and cash payments related to our restructuring programs 
the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to our loss from operations 
we have a million line of credit that bears interest at the bank s prime rate at july  plus per annum on any outstanding balances and expires december  as of july   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and million available 
this line of credit is collateralized by all of our assets and has certain non financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these non financial covenants as of july  the following sets forth information relating to the sources and uses of our cash 
year ended in thousands july  june  june  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents three months ended july  june  days sales outstanding net cash used in operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from our net loss  increases in our accounts receivable at july  due to an increase in our revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal and a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of certain disbursements 
this net use of cash was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses  primarily related to amortization of prepaid software royalty fees  and an increase in deferred revenue  primarily related to an increase in the number and aggregate dollar amount of our maintenance contracts 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal resulted primarily from our net loss  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and a decrease in deferred revenues due to recognition of certain software license revenue and amortization of maintenance contracts 
this net use of cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to a reduction in days of sales outstanding and lower revenues 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal reflects million of investments in computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements related to the consolidation of certain offices in conjunction with our october restructuring program 
net cash used in investing for fiscal reflects our investments in computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office furniture and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures for the next months will be approximately million  primarily for the acquisition of computer hardware and software 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal consists of the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal consists of our repurchases of common stock of million  offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and million  respectively 
on january   our board of directors the board approved a stock repurchase program the program whereby we were authorized to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
common stock repurchases under the program were able to be made in the open market  through block trades or otherwise during the one year period that began on january  during fiscal  we did not purchase or retire any shares of our common stock under the program 
repurchases made under the program during fiscal  totaling approximately million  were funded from available working capital 
the program terminated on january  on february   we announced that the board approved a voluntary stock option exchange program the option exchange program 
the option exchange program provided eligible holders of outstanding  unexercised options to purchase shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our third amended and restated stock plan the plan and our amended and restated stock plan the plan with an exercise price of at least per share the opportunity to tender such options in exchange for new replacement options 
the ratios of new replacement options to options tendered pursuant to the option exchange program were as follows for for options with exercise prices of to  for for options with exercise prices of to  and for for options with exercise prices of or more 
members of our board and our executive officers were not eligible to participate in the option exchange program 
options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were tendered and cancelled on march  pursuant to the option exchange program  and we granted new replacement options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share on september  in exchange for the tendered and cancelled options 
the new replacement options had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date the new replacement options were granted and vest quarterly over a month period 
we did not record any stock based compensation expense as a result of the option exchange program 

table of contents on august   we acquired synchronicity for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash and the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
additionally  we entered into a registration rights agreement dated as of august  the registration rights agreement  providing that we will prepare and file a registration statement on form s or such other appropriate form in accordance with the registration rights agreement to register such shares of our common stock on september  or as promptly as practicable thereafter 
we used our available cash and cash equivalents to fund the million in cash consideration 
we currently do not have any other agreements for other acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and available credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund an expansion of our business  develop new products  enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders may be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our stockholders 
the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to our acquisition of synchronicity will result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund an expansion of our business  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance our services or products would be significantly limited 
commitments and contractual obligations our commitments and contractual obligations for which we guarantee or contract for a minimum amount of fees primarily consist of operating leases for facilities  automobiles and office equipment  product development agreements under which we pay software license fees to third parties for development or assistance in development of certain business process applications and enterprise integration software and other contractual arrangements to support certain programs or activities 
our commitments and contractual obligations for which we guarantee or have minimum fees due consisted of the following as of july  in thousands thereafter leases development agreements minimum royalty fees other contractual arrangements we do not have any other commitments or contractual obligations in addition to those set forth above and those included in our consolidated financial statements as of july  off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of july  income taxes as of july   we had available us federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and million of available us federal and state tax credits to reduce future us income taxes 
these nols include deductions of approximately million related to certain stock option exercises 
the tax benefit from the nols related to the exercise of stock options will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as these nols are utilized 
the nols and tax credit carryforwards expire in varying 
table of contents amounts commencing in fiscal through fiscal  if not utilized 
use of these nols and tax credits may be limited due to certain changes in ownership 
as of july   we also had nol carryforwards in certain foreign countries aggregating million that are also subject to certain limitations 
these nols include deductions of approximately related to certain stock option exercises 
the tax benefit from the nols related to the exercise of stock options will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as these nols are utilized 
these nols expire in varying amounts commencing in fiscal  if not utilized 
we do not provide us taxes on our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as they are deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the us upon repatriation  we will provide the appropriate us income taxes on these earnings 
because of the uncertainty regarding our ability to use our united states and foreign nols and tax credit carryforwards  we have provided a full valuation allowance on these and all other deferred tax assets as of july  cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
any forward looking statement should be considered in light of the factors discussed below 
we have a history of losses  and we may incur losses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred substantial net losses in the past  and we may incur net losses in future periods 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to generate significant increases in revenues to achieve and maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or decline or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be significantly and adversely affected 
although we have implemented restructuring programs to better align our operations and cost structure with market conditions  these programs may not be sufficient for us to achieve profitability in any future period 
even if we achieve profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
failure to achieve profitability or achieve and sustain the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the uncertain computer software and services market and worldwide economic conditions may result in decreased revenues and operating losses the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the market segments in which we compete 
if the demand for computer software and services softens or fails to grow as a result of the uncertain economy  our revenues may decrease resulting in operating losses 
in this uncertain economy  we may not be able to effectively maintain existing levels of software and service revenues  promote future growth in our software and services revenues or achieve or maintain profitability 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of management  securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict  have varied significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the second half of the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult or impossible to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenues targets 
any disruption in our ability to conduct our business which occurs will likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a shortfall in revenues in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation changes in demand for our products and services  including seasonal differences  changes in the mix of our software license and service revenues  changes in the mix of the licensing of our matrix plm platform  business process applications and enterprise integration products  the amount of royalty payments due to third parties on our business process applications and enterprise integration software products  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  variability in the mix of professional services performed by us and systems integrators  and the amount of training we provide to systems integrators and alliance partners related to our products and their implementation 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if a shortfall in revenues occurs  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our software as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our software products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to nine months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or custom demonstration  before the customer places an order with us 
customers may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger customers may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if 
table of contents revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
we may not achieve our anticipated revenues if large software and service orders expected in a quarter are not placed or are delayed although we license our software to numerous customers in any quarter  a single customer often represents more than of our quarterly revenues 
we expect that revenues from large orders will continue to represent a large percentage of our total revenues in future quarters 
a customer may determine to increase its number of licenses and expand its implementation of our software throughout its organization and to its customers  suppliers and other business partners only after a successful initial implementation 
therefore  the timing of these large orders is often unpredictable 
if any large order anticipated for a particular quarter is not realized  delayed to another quarter or significantly reduced  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
if our existing customers do not license additional software products from us  we may not achieve growth in our revenues our customers initial implementations of our software often include a limited number of licenses 
customers may subsequently add licenses as they expand the implementations of our products throughout their enterprises or add software applications designed for specific functions 
therefore  it is important that our customers are satisfied with their initial product implementations 
if we do not increase licenses to existing customers  we may not be able to achieve growth in our revenues 
we must overcome significant challenges in integrating business operations and product offerings to realize the benefits of our recent acquisition of synchronicity we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of synchronicity unless we successfully combine and integrate the business operations and products of the two companies in a timely and effective manner 
integration will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may result in revenue disruption and operational difficulties 
following the acquisition  we must operate with synchronicity as a combined organization utilizing common information communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices 
we may experience substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in the integration of the synchronicity acquisition 
these difficulties  costs and delays may include the difficulties of integrating international and domestic operations  the disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management resources  an incompatibility of the business cultures  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology into our products and services  unanticipated expenses related to integration of operations  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers due to integration of new personnel  unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business and technology  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  including financial accounting systems and customer information systems  and 
table of contents inability to retain  integrate and motivate key management  marketing  technical sales and customer support personnel 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of the acquisition 
if we are not successful in integrating the synchronicity acquisition  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the market price of our common stock may decline 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  characterized by rapid technological change and evolution of standards and frequent new product introductions 
to obtain the full potential benefits of the acquisition  we must promptly integrate our business operations  technology and product offerings 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate their technology offerings and operations quickly and smoothly 
we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on developing our business or on other matters 
if we do not integrate our operations and technology smoothly or if management spends too much time on integration issues  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations and diminish the benefits of the acquisition as well as harm our existing business 
both matrixone and synchronicity have incurred significant costs associated with the acquisition we have incurred direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition  which will be included as a part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes  and synchronicity has also incurred direct transaction costs 
we believe the combined entity may incur charges to operations in the first quarter of fiscal or the following quarters to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies 
we expect to record ongoing charges for the amortization of intangibles  consisting primarily of purchased technology and customer lists acquired in the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the combined company will not incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the acquisition 
there may be sales of substantial amounts of our common stock after the synchronicity acquisition which could cause our stock price to fall we issued approximately million shares of our common stock as part of the aggregate purchase price to acquire synchronicity  which we are contractually obligated to publicly register on september  or as promptly as practicable thereafter 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the public market within a short period of time after the effectiveness of our registration statement to be filed pursuant to the synchronicity acquisition 
a sale of a large number of newly released shares of our common stock could therefore result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock 
future acquisitions may negatively affect our ongoing business operations and our operating results we may further expand our operations or market presence by acquiring or investing in additional complementary businesses  products or technologies that complement our business  increase our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer opportunities for growth 
these transactions create risks such as difficulty assimilating the operations  technology  products and personnel we acquire  disruption of our ongoing business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  one time charges and expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets  and potential dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents our inability to address these risks could negatively impact our operating results 
moreover  any future acquisitions  even if successfully completed  may not generate any additional revenues or provide any benefit to our business 
the market for our plm software is rapidly changing and demand for plm software could decline the market for plm software is rapidly changing 
we cannot be certain that this market will continue to develop and grow or that companies will choose to use our products rather than attempting to develop alternative platforms and applications internally or through other sources 
if we fail to establish a significant base of customer references  our ability to market and license our products successfully may be reduced 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing information during the design  manufacturing and supply process may be reluctant to adopt new technology or infrastructures that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems or methods 
we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and selling efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products 
therefore  demand for and market acceptance of our software products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if we are not successful in developing new products and services that keep pace with technology  our operating results will suffer the market for our software is characterized by rapid technological advances  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
accordingly  to realize our expectations regarding our operating results  we depend on our ability to develop  in a timely manner  new software products and services that keep pace with developments in technology  meet evolving customer requirements  and enhance our current product and service offerings and deliver those products and services through appropriate distribution channels 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  either enhancements to our products or new products that respond to technological advances and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
if we fail to introduce new products  our operating results will suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to  our software products could be rendered obsolete and our business could be materially harmed 
we may not achieve anticipated revenues if market acceptance of our software does not continue we believe that revenues from licenses of our software  together with revenues from related professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services  will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend on market acceptance of our software  including our matrix plm platform  business process applications and enterprise integration products  and any upgrades or enhancements that we may make to our products in the future 
as a result  if our software does not achieve and maintain widespread market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenues 
in addition  if our competitors release new products that are superior to our software  demand for our products may not accelerate and could decline 
if we are unable to increase the number and scope of our business process applications and enterprise integration products or ship or implement any upgrades or enhancements to our products when planned  or if the introduction of upgrades or enhancements causes customers to defer orders for our existing products  we also may not achieve anticipated revenues 

table of contents we will not succeed unless we can compete in our markets the markets in which we offer our software and services are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
furthermore  we expect competition to intensify  given the newly emerging nature of the market for plm software and consolidation in the software industry in general 
we will not succeed if we cannot compete effectively in these markets 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
many of our actual or potential competitors have significant advantages over us  including  without limitation larger and more established selling and marketing capabilities  significantly greater financial  engineering and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers  and well established relationships with our existing and potential customers  systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners 
as a result  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than we can 
accordingly  we may not be able to maintain or expand our revenues if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
as competition in the plm software market intensifies  new solutions will come to market 
our competitors may package their products in a manner that may discourage customers from licensing our software 
also  current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
consolidation in the industry also results in larger competitors that may have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
increased competition could result in reductions in price and revenues  lower profit margins  loss of customers and loss of market share 
any one of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on licensed third party technology  and the ability to interoperate with third party technology  the loss of which could adversely impact the licensing of our products  or result in increased costs of or delays in licensing our products we license technology from several companies on a non exclusive basis that is integrated into many of our products 
we also license certain enterprise interoperability products from third parties for the purposes of enabling our products to interoperate with third party application products 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of the software we license from third parties would be difficult and time consuming to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the licensing of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
the loss of the ability to integrate to any of the third party products could also adversely impact the licensing of our products 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products may depend upon the successful operation of third party licensed products in conjunction with our products  and therefore any undetected errors in these licensed products may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions or injure our reputation 
we could incur substantial costs defending our intellectual property from claims of infringement the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that our own intellectual property rights are invalid 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our 
table of contents industry grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
from time to time  we have received correspondence from competitors asserting potential infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims based upon the integration of our software with one or more of their software offerings  such integrations are typically performed at the request of mutual customers 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer or rename our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
licensing or royalty agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
even if successfully defended  claims of infringement could also result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources 
our revenues could decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners we pursue business alliances with systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners to endorse our software  implement our software  provide customer support services  promote and resell products that integrate with our products and develop industry specific software products 
these alliances provide an opportunity to license our products to our alliance partners installed customer bases 
in many cases  these parties have established relationships with our existing and potential customers and can influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these companies for recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners who  as a result  may be more likely to recommend our competitors products and services 
in addition  some of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
if we are unable to establish  maintain and strengthen these relationships  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the selling and marketing  implementation and support of our products 
our efforts may not be as effective as these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners  which could significantly harm our operating results 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels and improve our sales productivity we will need to expand our direct and indirect global sales operations and improve our sales productivity in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our software and generate increased revenues 
we market and license our products directly through our sales organization and indirectly through our global alliance partner and distributor network 
our ability to increase our global direct sales organization will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense in our industry 
in addition  it may take up to nine months for a new sales person to become fully productive 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired or existing sales personnel fail to develop the necessary skills  reach productivity more slowly than anticipated or are not able to maintain an expected level of productivity  we may have difficulty licensing our products  and we may experience a shortfall in anticipated revenues 
in addition  we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of our indirect global distribution channel  which consists of our relationships with a variety of systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and distributors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our current relationships or establish relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
our distribution partners may not devote adequate resources to promoting or selling our products and may not be successful 
in addition  we may also face potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third party reselling efforts 
any failure to expand our indirect global distribution channel or increase the productivity of this distribution channel could result in lower than anticipated revenues 

table of contents our international operations expose us to business risks which could cause our operating results to suffer our international revenues and expenses are generally transacted by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in local currency 
approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of our expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
at july  and june   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets were located at our foreign subsidiaries 
many of our customers have operations in numerous locations around the globe 
in order to attract  retain and service multi national customers  we have to maintain strong direct and indirect sales and support organizations in europe and asia pacific 
our ability to penetrate international markets may be impaired by resource constraints and our ability to hire qualified personnel in foreign countries 
we face a number of risks associated with conducting business internationally  which could negatively impact our operating results  including  without limitation difficulties relating to the management  administration and staffing of a globally dispersed business  longer sales cycles associated with educating foreign customers on the benefits of our products and services  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in providing customer support for our products in multiple time zones  currency fluctuations and exchange rates  limitations on repatriation of earnings of our foreign operations  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures  negative tax consequences such as withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes  language barriers  the need to consider numerous international product characteristics  different accounting practices  import export duties and tariffs  quotas and controls  complex and inflexible employment laws  economic or political instability in some international markets  and conflicting international business practices 
we believe that expansion into new international markets will be necessary for our future success 
therefore  a key aspect of our strategy is to continue to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we may not succeed in our efforts to enter new international markets 
if we fail to do so  we may not be able to maintain existing levels of 
table of contents revenues and promote growth in our revenues 
this international expansion may be more difficult or time consuming than we anticipate 
it is also costly to establish and maintain international facilities and operations and promote our products internationally 
thus  if revenues from international activities do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  our operating results will suffer 
our services revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain the billing and utilization rates for our professional services personnel the billing rates we charge for our professional services and the utilization  or chargeability  of our professional services personnel are significant components of our services revenues  gross margin and operating results 
our billing rates are affected by a number of factors  including the introduction of new services or products by our competitors  the pricing policies of our competitors  demand for professional services and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including seasonal trends  our ability to transition employees from completed professional services engagements to new engagements and our ability to forecast demand of our professional services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our professional services or an appropriate utilization for our professional services personnel  our service revenues and gross profit are likely to decline  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we occasionally perform professional services engagements on a fixed price basis  which could cause a decline in our gross margins we occasionally perform professional services engagements on a fixed price basis 
prior to performing a fixed price professional services engagement  we estimate the amount of work involved for the engagement 
however  we may underestimate the amount of time or resources required to complete a professional services engagement  and we may not be able to charge the customer for the additional work performed 
if we do not correctly estimate the amount of time or resources required for a professional services engagement and we are not able to charge the customer for the additional work performed  our gross profit would decline  which would adversely affect our operating results 
if systems integrators are not available or fail to perform adequately  our customers may suffer implementation delays and a lower quality of customer service  and we may incur increased expenses systems integrators often are retained by our customers to implement our products 
if experienced systems integrators are not available to implement our products  we will be required to provide these services internally  and we may not have sufficient resources to meet our customers implementation needs on a timely basis 
use of our professional services personnel to implement our products would also increase our expenses 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
if these systems integrators do not perform to the satisfaction of our customers  our customers could become dissatisfied with our products  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain key personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed our ability to implement our business strategy and our future success depends largely on the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry or customer experience and relationships 
the loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of these key personnel could result in delays in product development  loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  our future performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  engineering  marketing  services and managerial personnel  and there is intense competition for such personnel 
if we do not succeed in retaining our personnel or in attracting new employees  our business could suffer significantly 

table of contents our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues and expose us to litigation despite testing by us  our alliance partners and our customers  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
we and our customers have from time to time discovered errors in our software products 
in the future  there may be additional errors and defects in our software 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and damage to our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of our products 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
since our products are used by customers for mission critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could also result in financial or other damages to our customers  who could assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims 
a product liability claim  even if unsuccessful  would be costly and time consuming to defend and could harm our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed in the future  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline we have been unable to fund our operations using cash generated from our business operations and have financed our operations principally through the sale of securities 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund an expansion of our operations  to enhance our products and services  or to acquire or invest in complementary products  services  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on terms favorable to us  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline 
our business may be adversely affected by securities class action litigation on april   a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the complaint  which superseded five virtually identical complaints that had been filed from july  to september   names as defendants the company  two of our officers  and certain underwriters involved in our initial public offering of common stock ipo 
the complaint is allegedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from february  to december  and asserts  among other things  that our ipo prospectus and registration statement violated federal securities laws because they contained material misrepresentations and or omissions regarding the conduct of our ipo underwriters in allocating shares in our ipo to the underwriters customers 
the action seeks damages  fees and costs associated with the litigation  and interest 
we and our officers and directors believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and have defended the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending lawsuit 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the price of its securities 
due to the volatility of our stock price  we may be the target of securities litigation in the future 
the expense of defending and the outcome of pending and future shareholder litigation including the new york securities litigation described above and in legal proceedings in part  item of this annual report on form k and the possible inadequacy of the company s insurance to cover its obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any pending or future litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
securities litigation could also divert management s attention and resources from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our name recognition efforts and ability to compete effectively currently  we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection to protect our intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
a third party could obtain our proprietary information or develop products or technology competitive with ours 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
we have registered some of our trademarks in the united states and abroad and have other trademark and patent applications pending or in preparation 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may lead to losses by stockholders the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors  the market for our products and services and the global economy  many of which are beyond our control  such as variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of software companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant business transactions  additions or departures of key personnel  the threat of additional litigation by current or former employees  customers  and shareholders  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by existing shareholders  sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future  and news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular 
table of contents companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
these provisions include  without limitation authorizing the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have foreign subsidiaries in austria  canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore and the netherlands 
our international revenues and expenses are generally transacted by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in local currency 
approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of our expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
at july  and june   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets were located at our foreign subsidiaries 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition translation risk 
therefore  we are exposed to both foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently do not enter into contracts or agreements to minimize our exposure to the effects of changes in foreign currency when the results of our international subsidiaries are translated to us dollars 
accordingly  if the dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies  our revenues and expenses would increase when stated in us dollars 
conversely  if the dollar strengthens  our revenues and expenses would decrease 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from the payment of intercompany transactions 
our intercompany transactions are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk at the parent company in the united states 
the parent company and our foreign subsidiaries may also transact business in a currency other than the local currency 
our foreign currency hedging program is principally designed to mitigate the future potential impact of changes in the value of transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency as a result of 
table of contents changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may impact our results of operations 
our foreign currency hedging program is not designed  nor do we enter into foreign currency contracts  to mitigate translation risk 
we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in a currency other than the local currency and certain intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable transactions designated for repayment 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables or payables are recognized and generally offset 
gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense  net 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we only enter into forward contracts with highly rated financial institutions 
at july   we there were no forward contracts outstanding 
we plan to continue our use of forward contracts and other instruments in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations from accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in a currency other than the local currency and certain intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable transactions designated for repayment  and we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on our results of operations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
also  as we continue to expand our operations outside of the united states  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 
we deposit our cash in highly rated financial institutions in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we invest in diversified united states and international money market mutual funds and united states treasury and agency securities 
at july   we had million  million and million invested in the united states  continental europe and england  respectively 
at july   the weighted average interest rate on our investments was per annum 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe we have minimal market risk 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
all of our investments have remaining maturities of three months or less 
if these short term assets were reinvested in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience an immediate negative impact on other income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment
