item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a leading marketer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of branded otc healthcare products  toiletries and dietary supplements including such categories as topical analgesics  medicated skin care products  medicated dandruff shampoos  dietary supplements  and other otc and toiletry products 
our portfolio of products includes well recognized brands such as topical analgesics such as icy hot  aspercreme and flexall  medicated skin care products such as gold bond medicated skin care powder  cream  lotion  first aid  and foot care products  and phisoderm medicated acne treatment products and skin cleansers  selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner  dietary supplements including dexatrim  garlique and new phase  and other otc and toiletry products such as pamprin and premsyn pms  menstrual analgesics  herpecin l  a lip care product  benzodent  a dental analgesic cream  and toiletries such as mudd  a line of deep cleanser masques  bullfrog  a line of sunblocks  ultraswim  chlorine removing shampoo  and sun in  a hair lightener 
our products typically target niche markets that are often outside the core product areas of larger companies where we believe we can achieve and sustain significant market penetration through innovation and strong advertising and promotion support 
many of our products are among the us market leaders in their respective categories 
for example  our portfolio of topical analgesic brands and our gold bond medicated body powders have the leading us market share in these categories 
we support our brands through extensive and cost effective advertising and promotion  the expenditures for which represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we sell our products nationally through mass merchandiser  drug and food channels principally utilizing our own sales force 
our strategy to achieve future growth is to generate new sales through strong marketing and promotional programs  new product developments  acquisitions of new brands  development of strategic marketing alliances and expansion of our international business 
as previously high growth brands mature  sales increases will become even more dependent on the development of successful line extensions  international expansion and acquisitions 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we introduced gold bond antifungal foot swabs  gold bond first aid quick spray and gold bond first aid wipes 
in the third quarter of  we began shipping gold bond ultimate healing skin therapy lotion and the icy hot back patch 
line extensions  product introductions and acquisitions require a significant amount of introductory advertising and promotional support 
for a period of time  these products do not generate a commensurate amount of sales or earnings 
as a result  we may experience a short term impact on our profitability due to line extensions and acquisitions 
in march  we acquired worldwide rights except in india to manufacture  sell and market selsun blue plus related intellectual property and certain manufacturing equipment from abbott 
abbott  or manufacturers under contract to abbott  manufactured selsun blue for us domestically until june  and internationally will manufacture the product for us  except in north america and a few foreign countries  until the end of march we have entered into an amendment to the manufacturing agreement with abbott under which abbott will continue to manufacture selsun for us for the european  middle east and several latin american markets for up to an additional two year period ending march abbott will also continue to serve as our distributor for selsun in certain foreign countries under separate distribution agreements 
all of our north american selsun blue product lines are presently being manufactured at our chattanooga facilities 
we generally pay abbott over standard manufacturing costs until we assume manufacturing or enter into third party agreements 
this fee will increase to for markets supplied by abbott manufacturing facilities after march abbott is also marketing  selling and distributing selsun products for us in certain foreign countries until we satisfy various foreign regulatory requirements  new distributors are in place and any applicable marketing permits are transferred 
during the transition period  abbott pays us an initial royalty equal to of international sales of selsun in these countries with the royalty reduced to of international sales in certain countries if foreign regulatory requirements are satisfied prior to our assumption of sales and marketing responsibility in such countries 
abbott pays all costs and expenses related to the manufacture  marketing and sales of selsun in these countries 
as we assume responsibility for the sales and marketing effort in a country  the royalty arrangement with respect to such country terminates 
we then record these international sales directly as well as the costs and expenses associated with these sales 
in certain international markets  we have licensed selsun to a distributor and receive a royalty based on a percentage of the distributor sales of selsun in that market 
we have completed the transition in most of the significant markets and expect to complete the transition in most of the significant markets by the end of march in fiscal  our international revenues were million or approximately of total revenues 
we are focusing our efforts on expanding selsun s international presence in existing key markets  such as canada  mexico  brazil  the uk and australia  as well as new markets such as central europe and certain far east markets 
as we initially focus on existing key markets  we are discontinuing the sale of selsun in certain smaller markets and will thus experience what we believe will be a short term decrease in international sales of selsun 
we also intend to leverage selsun s international marketing and distribution network to launch certain of our other brands in countries where they are not currently being sold 
the timing of such launches will be dependent on the local distributors resources as well as any regulatory requirements 
in connection with our acquisition of selsun blue in march  we entered into the credit facility  which included a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the credit facility together with our available cash was used to finance the acquisition of selsun blue 
on august   the credit facility was amended to increase the level of permitted capital expenditures and the dollar amount of our common stock we can purchase  redeem  acquire or retire 
on november   a second amendment to the credit facility was completed to revise the restrictions on obligations under operating leases 
as of november   we owed million under the credit facility 
during the year ended november   we repurchased and placed in treasury  shares of our common stock for million in accordance with our previously announced stock buyback program 
in january  our board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase stock under our stock buyback program to million 
the remaining availability under the board authorization was million at november  in january  the board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase our common stock under the buyback program to million 
ebitda  earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  is a key non gaap financial measure used by us to measure operating performance but may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income 
ebitda is used to supplement net income as an indicator of operating performance and not as an alternative to measures defined and required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we consider ebitda an important indicator of our operational strength and performance  including our ability to pay interest  service debt and fund capital expenditures 
ebitda is also one measure used in the calculation of certain ratios to determine our compliance with the terms of our credit facility 
our net debt ratio total debt less cash and cash equivalents ebitda was x  x and x in  and  respectively 
the ratio of ebitda to interest expense was x  x and x in  and  respectively

given the perceived safety concerns and the regulatory uncertainties relating to ephedrine  we developed alternative formulations for dexatrim natural and dexatrim results to exclude ephedrine 
on september   we discontinued the manufacturing and shipment of dexatrim natural and dexatrim results containing ephedrine 
negative publicity relating to the possible harmful effects of ephedrine and the possibility of further regulatory action to restrict or prohibit the sale of products containing ephedrine has resulted in returns of these products from retailers for which we provided an million allowance in the first quarter of fiscal at this time  we believe we have received returns representing substantially all dexatrim with ephedrine 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the unused portion of the returns allowance for dexatrim containing ephedrine of million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
on december   the united states food and drug administration the fda issued a consumer alert on the safety of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids and on february  published a final rule with respect to these products 
the final rule prohibits the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids because such supplements present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
the final rule becomes effective on april  although we discontinued the manufacturing and shipment of dexatrim containing ephedrine in september  the fda s final rule may result in lawsuits in addition to those we currently have being filed against us alleging damages related to the use or purchase of dexatrim containing ephedrine 
on december   we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the psc  which memorializes certain settlement terms concerning lawsuits relating to dexatrim products containing ppa 
we are currently negotiating with the psc on the terms of a settlement agreement that will supercede the memorandum of understanding 
since the terms of the preliminary settlement in the ppa litigation are not final or binding  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach a final settlement or that if a final settlement is reached  the terms will be approved by the court 
if the settlement is approved  we believe that the settlement will include a substantial majority of the claims by users of dexatrim products containing ppa  but that some claims may elect to opt out of any class settlement and will continue to pursue claims for damages against us in separate lawsuits 
we cannot estimate at this time how many claims will opt out or whether such claims will result in significant additional liability for us 
to the extent the number of opt outs are deemed excessive relative to the total number of claims  as determined by the final settlement agreement  we reserve the right to terminate the settlement 
although we believe a liability existed as of november  related to our ppa litigation  since the terms of the settlement are preliminary  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such liability at november  and have made no provision for this liability in our consolidated financial statements 
however  if the settlement is approved based on the proposed terms and information currently known to us about the pending cases  we estimate that we may record during fiscal a charge  net of insurance recovery  of approximately million  or an after tax charge of million approximately 
per share  for settlement costs  administrative expenses and costs of defense related to resolving the ppa litigation during fiscal in addition  we currently expect to use most of our available product liability insurance coverage available for the ppa litigation and certain of our cash on hand to make the initial funding of the settlement trust 
to the extent the amount in the settlement trust is ultimately insufficient to fully fund the settlement  we may be required to make additional contributions to the trust fund in the future 
if we are required to fund significant other liabilities beyond the initial settlement amount  either pursuant to the terms of the settlement  as a result of litigation or otherwise  we will have significantly fewer sources of funds with which to satisfy such liabilities  and we may be unable to do so 
moreover  if the settlement is not approved  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all claims against us 
we have reached an agreement with kemper to settle kemper s lawsuit that sought to rescind our policy for million of excess coverage for product liability claims 
after giving effect to the settlement with kemper  we will have available for the claims against us related to the ppa litigation  through our first three layers of insurance coverage  subject to certain limitations  approximately million of the million of product liability coverage provided by these policies 
the million of available coverage consists of million of insurance under the kemper policy and approximately million under policies with two other insurance companies 
we continue to aggressively defend an action brought by interstate to rescind its million of excess coverage for product liability and pursue our available remedies at law against interstate 
the interstate policy is in excess of the product liability insurance available from kemper and the two other insurance companies referred to above 
in the event the million of insurance funds are exhausted under the contemplated ppa litigation settlement or otherwise  coverage under the interstate policy would not be available until we have paid the million difference up to million 
we currently expect to use most of our product liability insurance coverage available for the ppa litigation to make the initial funding of the proposed ppa settlement trust 
recent developments on february   we announced our plans to sell million of senior floating rate notes due the floating rate notes and million of senior subordinated fixed rate notes due the fixed rate notes  and  together with the floating rate notes  the new notes  subject to market and other conditions the offering 
we intend to use the proceeds of the offering  together with borrowings under a new million senior secured revolving credit facility  described below  to refinance our existing debt 
we have commenced a tender offer for any and all of our approximately million outstanding principal amount of senior notes 
in connection with the tender offer  we are soliciting the consent of the holders of the senior notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes 
our obligation to accept the senior notes tendered in the tender offer is conditioned upon the consummation of the offering  receipt of the requisite consents to amend the indenture governing the senior notes and certain other conditions 
the tender offer will expire on march  unless extended 
we have executed a commitment letter to enter into a new senior secured revolving credit facility the new credit facility  that will enable us  subject to certain conditions  to borrow up to million and  subject to successful syndication  a further million 
we expect to close the committed portion of the new credit facility upon consummation of the offering 
the issuance of the new notes is conditioned on the closing of such committed portion 
borrowings under the new credit facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets and the shares of capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries held by us and by the assets of the guarantors of the new credit facility 
upon the consummation of the offering  we intend to repay the remaining million outstanding as of february  under the credit facility  which will then be terminated 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for income before change in accounting principle and for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended november  total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net net gain on early extinguishment of debt total other income expense income before income taxes and change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income before change in accounting principle critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use estimates 
several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and any known specific events that affect the accrual 
we charge the allowance account resulting from this accrual with any authorized deduction from remittance by the customer or product returns upon receipt of the product 
in accordance with industry practice  we allow our customers to return unsold sun care products ie bullfrog line of products at the end of the sun care season 
we record the sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
at the time of shipment  we also record a reduction in sales and an allowance on our balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
each percentage point change in our return rate would impact our net sales by approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we revised downward our estimate of returns related to our sunsource and bullfrog lines of products by approximately million  which was included as an increase in net sales in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimate was revised downward due to the stronger than expected performance of certain items in the sunsource and bullfrog lines 
we routinely enter into agreements with our customers to participate in promotional programs 
these programs generally take the form of coupons  temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in advertising vehicles provided uniquely by the customer 
the ultimate cost of these programs is often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
estimated unit sales of a product under a promotional program are used to estimate the total cost of the program  which is recorded as a reduction of sales 
actual results can differ from the original estimate 
we also consider customer delays in requesting promotional program payments when evaluating the required accrual 
many customers audit programs significantly after the date of performance to determine the actual amount due and make a claim for reimbursement at that time 
as a result  changes in the unit sales trends under promotional programs as well as the timing of payments could result in changes in the accrual 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised downward our estimate of the promotional accrual related to special events by approximately million  which is included as an increase in net sales in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we record income tax expense in our financial statements based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
during  we revised our estimated income tax rate based on the implementation of state income tax planning strategies 
this revision resulted in a decrease in the annual effective income tax rate during fiscal year to 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment of approximately million  which represents the impact of the reduction of the effective annual tax rate on our deferred tax accounts 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands domestic net sales international revenues including royalties total revenues cost of sales advertising and promotion expense selling  general and administrative expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net income before change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle   nm net income domestic net sales domestic net sales for fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal for a description of each brand included in the category  see products in item of this form k 
a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands topical analgesics medicated skin care products dietary supplements medicated dandruff shampoos other otc and toiletry products total our increases in the domestic net sales for medicated dandruff shampoos and medicated skin care products were offset by decreases in other product categories 
domestic net sales of selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoo  which was acquired in march  continued to benefit from a strong advertising campaign and increased retail distribution 
net sales growth in the medicated skin care products category was led by an increase of approximately in the gold bond franchise 
gold bond sales growth was attributable to the successful launch of two new first aid items and the antifungal foot swab in the first quarter and gold bond ultimate healing skin therapy lotion in the third quarter 
in addition  gold bond sales growth came from the lotion and foot care lines 
this was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in phisoderm net sales compared to the prior year when the brand was relaunched and the phisoderm clear confidence acne body wash  phisoderm clear confidence acne facial mask and phisoderm clear confidence acne clear swab products were initially shipped to retailers 
with the exception of icy hot  sales declines were recorded for our topical analgesic portfolio icy hot  flexall  aspercreme  sportscreme  capzasin  and arthritis hot as competition from inside and outside the category increased 
sales of icy hot grew principally due to the introduction of the icy hot back patch 
net sales for the dietary supplement category declined primarily due to a drop in dexatrim sales from last year 
sales of dexatrim were impacted by the overall decline in the diet pill market driven by negative ephedrine publicity 
the decline in net sales of dexatrim was partially offset by increased sales of garlique and new phase 
the increase in net sales of garlique and new phase was primarily attributable to effective media campaigns and in the case of new phase increased distribution 
the decrease in net sales of other otc products was due primarily to sales declines of pamprin and premsyn pms  as a result of intense competition 
with the exception of new phase  sales variances for domestic were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes 
new phase sales increased partially due to a unit sales price increase 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues  including royalties of million from the sales of selsun  increased million or as compared to fiscal our canadian and uk subsidiaries experienced a and sales increase  respectively  primarily as a result of selsun sales 
other international revenues increased almost entirely as a result of the acquisition of selsun blue in the second quarter of fiscal sales variances for international operations were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal in fiscal  cost of sales increased as a result of higher material costs and manufacturing overhead partially offset by decreased costs resulting from the transition of the north american manufacturing of selsun blue to our facility in chattanooga 
advertising and promotion expense advertising and promotion expenses increased million or as compared to fiscal and were of total revenues for fiscal compared to for fiscal increases in advertising and promotion expenditures in fiscal were recorded for icy hot  flexall  sportscreme  the recently introduced gold bond products  new phase  selsun blue  bullfrog  and herpecin l 
decreases in advertising and promotion expenditures were recognized for the balance of the topical analgesic brands  phisoderm  dexatrim  mudd  pamprin  garlique  and the other gold bond products 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was largely a result of international severance costs and legal expenses related to the dexatrim with ppa and the kemper litigation 
interest expense interest expense decreased million or as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of lower outstanding balances under our credit facility 
until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
investment and other income investment and other income increased million or as compared to fiscal primarily due to a fiscal charge of approximately million related to the write off of equipment offset by a decline in interest income in fiscal the use of cash and cash equivalents to make principal payments on our credit facility and lower interest rates on short term investments contributed to the decrease in interest income 
income before change in accounting principle income before change in accounting principle increased million or as compared to fiscal this increase primarily resulted from lower costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues and increased revenues 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires us to perform certain fair value based tests of the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption and thereafter at least annually and to discontinue amortization of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas  we obtained independent appraisals to determine the fair value of these assets as of december  and recorded a write down of million  net of income tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and discontinued the amortization of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
the write down was primarily related to our sunsource product line  which experienced a decline in sales volume since its initial purchase in  and to a lesser degree our dexatrim product line  which discontinued the marketing of one of its products in november fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands domestic net sales international revenues including royalties total revenues cost of sales advertising and promotion expense selling  general and administrative expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net net gain on early extinguishment of debt   nm income before change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle   nm net income domestic net sales domestic net sales in fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands topical analgesics medicated skin care products dietary supplements medicated dandruff shampoos   nm other otc and toiletry products total sales increases were recognized for all of our otc health care product categories 
our topical analgesic portfolio produced a sales increase principally attributable to the continued success of the icy hot patch  introduced in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as continued marketing support 
we recorded sales increases in our topical analgesics portfolio for icy hot  aspercreme  capzasin and arthritis hot  while flexall and sportscreme recorded sales declines 
sales increases were also recorded for dexatrim  behind the launch of dexatrim results during fiscal  gold bond  driven by the gold bond foot care products  and phisoderm  due to the launch of three new phisoderm acne products 
in addition  garlique and new phase recorded sales increases 
we recorded sales declines for pamprin  premsyn pms  ultraswim  mudd and herpecin l 
sales variances were largely the result of changes in the volume of unit sales of the particular brand 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues  including royalties of million from the sales of selsun  increased million or as compared to fiscal our canadian and uk subsidiaries experienced an and increase in sales  respectively 
these royalties will continue through the transition period during which abbott is marketing  selling and distributing selsun for us internationally 
the increase in canadian sales was due primarily to the acquisition of selsun blue in march and strong sales of phisoderm partially offset by declines in sales of our other brands 
the increase in the uk business was driven by the success of our eastern european distributor markets across several brands 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the uk domestic business primarily as a result of reduced sales for sun in  cornsilk and ultraswim 
other international revenues increased primarily due to the acquisition of selsun blue in fiscal sales variances for international operations were principally the result of changes in the volume of unit sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was the result of the inclusion in total revenues of royalty income from the international operations of selsun as well as favorable manufacturing costs related to increased volume

interest expense interest expense decreased million or as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of the retirement of million principal amount of our senior notes and the remaining outstanding principal balance of million of our senior subordinated notes due senior notes in fiscal  partially offset by the increased indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisition of selsun blue in march until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues

the write down was primarily related to our sunsource product line  which experienced a decline in sales volume since its initial purchase in  and to a lesser degree our dexatrim product line  which discontinued the marketing of one of its products in november liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings 
our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses  servicing long term debt  acquisitions  working capital  repurchases of our common stock  payment of income taxes and capital expenditures 
cash of million and million was provided by operations for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operations over the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net income 
the decrease in accrued liabilities related primarily to accrued product advertising and promotion costs 
investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in usage of cash in fiscal was primarily due to the absence of a significant product line acquisition such as the purchase of selsun blue in fiscal financing activities used cash of million in fiscal but provided cash of million in fiscal in fiscal  additional borrowings were required to partially finance the selsun blue acquisition 
in fiscal  cost of repurchases of our common shares increased and proceeds from the exercise of our stock options decreased 
total debt consists of our senior notes and our credit facility and was million at november  compared to million at november  loans under our credit facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus applicable percentages of to or a base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate plus applicable percentages of to 
the aforementioned applicable percentages are calculated based on our leverage 
we repaid million of long term debt during the year ended november   of which million was voluntarily prepaid 
we will be required to pay the remaining balance of the credit facility of million by april due to an excess cash flow mandatory prepayment calculation under the terms of the credit facility 
on december   we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the psc  which memorializes certain settlement terms concerning lawsuits relating to dexatrim products containing ppa 
we are currently negotiating with the psc on the terms of a settlement agreement that will supercede the memorandum of understanding 
since the terms of the preliminary settlement in the dexatrim litigation are not final or binding  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach a final settlement or that if a final settlement is reached  the terms will be approved by the court 
if the settlement is approved  we believe that the settlement will include a substantial majority of the claims by users of dexatrim products containing ppa  but that some claims may elect to opt out of any class settlement and will continue to pursue claims for damages against us in separate lawsuits 
we cannot estimate at this time how many claims will opt out or whether such claims will result in significant additional liability for us 
to the extent the number of opt outs are deemed excessive relative to the total number of claims  as determined by the final settlement agreement  we reserve the right to terminate the settlement 
delaco filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on february  in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
we understand that delaco intends to implement its contemplated settlement with the psc through a liquidating chapter bankruptcy plan 
if delaco pursues the settlement through its bankruptcy plan  we expect that the administrative process for delaco s settlement will be similar to the process in our class action 
we will be required to file a claim in delaco s bankruptcy case in order to preserve our claims for indemnification against delaco 
as part of this chapter plan  we expect that after resolution of creditors claims  delaco will seek to liquidate and distribute all of its assets and will dissolve as a company 
although we believe a liability existed as of november  related to ppa litigation  since the terms of the settlement are preliminary  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of such liability at november  and have made no provision for this liability in our consolidated financial statements 
however  if the settlement is approved based on the proposed terms and information currently known to us about the pending cases  we estimate that we will record  during fiscal  a charge  net of insurance recovery  of approximately million  or an after tax charge of million approximately 
per share  for settlement costs  administrative expenses and costs of defense related to resolving the ppa litigation 
in addition  we currently expect to use most of our product liability insurance coverage available for the ppa litigation and certain of our cash on hand to make the initial funding of the settlement trust 
to the extent the amount in the settlement trust fund is ultimately insufficient to fully fund the settlement  we may be required to make additional contributions to the trust fund in the future 
if we are required to fund significant other liabilities beyond the initial settlement amount  either pursuant to the terms of the settlement  as a result of litigation or otherwise  we will have significantly fewer sources of funds with which to satisfy such liabilities  and we may be unable to do so 
moreover  if the settlement is not approved  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all claims against us 
we have reached an agreement with kemper to settle kemper s lawsuit that sought to rescind our policy for million of excess coverage for product liability claims 
after giving effect to the settlement with kemper  we will have available for the claims against us related to the ppa litigation  through our first three layers of insurance coverage  subject to certain limitations  approximately million of the million of product liability coverage provided by these policies 
the million of available funds consists of million of insurance under the kemper policy and approximately million under policies with two other insurance companies 
we continue to aggressively defend an action brought by interstate to rescind its million of excess coverage for product liability and pursue our available remedies at law against interstate 
the interstate policy is in excess of the product liability insurance described above 
in the event the million of insurance funds are exhausted under the ppa litigation settlement or otherwise  coverage under the interstate policy would not be available until we have paid the million difference up to million 
we currently expect to use most of our product liability insurance coverage available for the ppa litigation to make the initial funding of the proposed ppa settlement trust 
as of november   the remaining amount authorized by our board of directors under our stock buyback program was million  however  we are limited in our ability to repurchase shares due to restrictions under the terms of the indenture with respect to which our senior notes were issued and under the terms of our credit facility 
the terms of the new notes and the new credit facility will contain similar restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares 
in january  the board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase our common stock under the buyback program to million 
also  on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for million of debt and equity securities of which million was utilized in the sale of the senior notes in may we have the capacity  subject to compliance with the terms of our indebtedness  to issue an additional million of securities under a shelf registration statement 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balance and funds available under our credit facility as amended or replaced will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future as our business is currently conducted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risks from these interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our regular operating and financing activities 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our senior notes and our credit facility 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of november  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
loans under our credit facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus applicable percentages of to or a base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate plus applicable percentages of to 
the aforementioned applicable percentages are calculated based on our leverage 
as of november   the variable rate on the term loan under our credit facility was 
the balance outstanding under our term loan was million as of november  the impact on our results of operations of a one point rate change on the outstanding balance of our term loan as of the end of fiscal would be approximately  net of tax 
as of november   no revolving credit loans or letters of credit were outstanding under our credit facility 
we are subject to risk from changes in the foreign exchange rates relating to our canadian and uk subsidiaries 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated to us dollars at year end exchange rates 
income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses  which result from foreign currency transactions  are included in the consolidated statements of income 
during  pursuant to our supply agreement with abbott  we were billed in us dollars for purchases of selsun for foreign markets 
in many cases in the future  we will be billed in the respective foreign currency 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the quoted foreign currency exchange rate amounts to approximately million at november  this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
