this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since our incorporation in november  we have developed  produced and sold a variety of microcatheters  including those for the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia 
since  however  our efforts have primarily focused on developing differentiated products that diagnose and treat atrial fibrillation  including our revelation tx microcatheter for use in the electrophysiology ep market and our surgical ablation system for use in the surgical market 
our ep products provide for the mapping diagnosis and ablation treatment of the two most common forms of cardiac arrhythmias atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia 
arrhythmias are abnormal electrical heart rhythms that adversely affect the mechanical activities of the heart and can significantly affect a person s quality of life and be potentially fatal 
we have developed microcatheter based systems designed to locate and provide more extensive and less traumatic access to arrhythmia causing tissue for diagnosing the arrhythmia  referred to as mapping  and to restore normal heart rhythms by isolating and destroying the arrhythmia causing tissue using radio frequency energy  referred to as ablation 
our microcatheters incorporate multiple electrodes at the distal end to record electrical signals for mapping and  with certain microcatheters  to transfer radio frequency energy for tissue ablation  allowing physicians to both map and ablate arrhythmias using the same microcatheter 
more recently  we have leveraged our proprietary technologies for treating atrial fibrillation  or af  into the development of products for the surgical market 
on january   we received notice from the fda that they had approved for commercialization the cardima surgical ablation system for use in cardiac surgery 
this new system connects the cardima surgical ablation probe with deflectable multi electrode linear array microcatheter technology to a commercially available electro surgical radio frequency generator and the intellitemp  a radio frequency  or rf  energy management device  which allows surgeons to direct rf energy through any combination of up to eight probe electrodes simultaneously  a feature which can significantly reduce the time required to perform the ablation procedure 
since september  the surgical ablation system has been utilized on a limited basis to treat af as an adjunct procedure to valve replacement 
while early results are promising  additional patient follow up data will be required over a period of six months or more  to judge the long term effectiveness and safety of our system 
we have generated revenues of approximately million from inception to december  prior to january  these revenues were generated primarily in europe and japan from sales of our pathfinder and tracer microcatheter systems for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia and our revelation microcatheter system for diagnosing atrial fibrillation  as well as ancillary products such as the venaport guiding catheters 
since and the us food and drug administration s clearance of certain of our products  sales in the united states consist primarily of our pathfinder and revelation lines of microcatheters for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation  respectively 
to date  our international sales have been made through our small direct sales force  which currently consists of one salesperson  and distributors who sell 
table of contents our products to physicians and hospitals 
european sales consist primarily of the revelation tx  revelation t flex and revelation helix microcatheters for treatment of atrial fibrillation following receipt of ce mark for those products in december  december and november  respectively 
we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
we expect that our operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest substantial resources in product development  pre clinical and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval  sales and marketing and manufacturing 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals is critical to our business 
we are required to conduct clinical trials  demonstrate safety and effectiveness and obtain either k or pma approval from the us food and drug administration in order to sell any of our products for treating atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in the united states 
while the surgical ablation system has received k approval from the fda  pma approval will be required prior to the introduction in the united states of the revelation tx  revelation t flex and revelation helix microcatheter systems for treating atrial fibrillation 
outside of the united states  our strategy has been to obtain regulatory approvals in those geographies that offer existing infrastructure to support medical technology as well as offer the potential for adequate product demand with the goal of positioning us to expand into these geographies once we have sufficient capital and other resources 
to date  we have emphasized obtaining regulatory approvals in western europe and select portions of asia 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval 
our primary focus is to obtain fda approval in the united states of the revelation tx microcatheter system for the treatment of atrial fibrillation 
on september   we submitted a pma application for this system to the fda 
on november   the pma was accepted by the fda and was granted expedited review status 
on may   we met with fda s circulatory systems device panel which recommended that the fda not approve our pma for the revelation tx linear ablation microcatheter system 
the circulatory system devices panel commented favorably on the safety and need for this type of device 
however  the panel felt that efficacy data was not sufficiently clear and supportive for the approval 
the panel provided several suggestions on how to possibly reexamine the existing data or how to collect more data on existing patients 
on june  we received a letter from the fda  which stated that the fda concurred with the panels non approval recommendation 
on january  we submitted a supplement to our pma filing  in which we provided new analysis and an expanded patient base 
the timing and the outcome of the fda s response are uncertain 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of march  our management believes that our cash balances as of march   will be sufficient to fund planned future expenditures into the fourth quarter of although our management recognizes the need to raise funds in the near there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such transaction  or  if we do consummate a financing transaction  that the terms and conditions of such financing will not be unfavorable to us 
any failure by us to obtain additional funding will have a material and adverse effect upon us and will likely result in our inability to continue as a going concern 
our independent auditors have concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  and have  therefore  modified their report in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
the company operates in a single segment 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates use of estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from two types of customers end users and distributors 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment of the product has occurred and title of products transferred at the point of shipment  payment of the product is reasonably assured and no substantive obligations to the customer remain 
customers are not entitled to any rights of product return 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of  should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory inventories  which are composed of purchased parts and subassemblies  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
we have analyzed the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual and or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for excess and slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of  at december  is adequate 
research and development research and development costs  which include clinical and regulatory costs  are charged to expense as incurred 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options  including financial accounting standard board interpretation fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  between the fair value of the company s common stock and the exercise price of the option or share right on the measurement date  which is basically the date of the grant 
this amount is recorded as deferred stock compensation in the balance sheet and amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the applicable options or share rights 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and net sales for the year ended december   net revenue increased to  from  for the same period of us sales increased by to  from  european sales decreased by to  from  as we reduced our sales force in europe due to the change in our business strategy  refocusing our efforts on the pma for the revelation tx 
sales in the asia pacific market increased to  from  due to higher diagnostic product sales in this region 
in  we expect net sales to be generated from the following geographic regions approximately from sales in the united states  from asia and from europe  with limited clinical revenue and sales from regions of the rest of the world at 
we expect overall net sales to slightly increase in as compared to  although our actual sales could differ materially from this estimate 
see factors affecting future results 
because the electrophysiology market is comprised of a focused  specialized group of physicians  we market and distribute our products in the united states with a small direct sales force and we market and distribute our products internationally through a small direct sales force and distributors in selected countries who sell our products to physicians and hospitals 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs  catheter fabrication costs  system assembly and testing costs and manufacturing overhead 
cost of goods sold for increased to  from  for this represents an increase of less than  or  which corresponds directly to the increase in net sales in as compared to we expect costs per unit to continue to slightly decrease as we plan to increase sales and related production volume  which will further allocate fixed costs over an increased number of units produced 
we will continue to work on process improvements to provide greater manufacturing flexibility and cost savings in the production of our microcatheter systems 
research and development expenses overall research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in this net decrease was a result of lower research and development expenses due to a reduction in force  as well as lower travel and other operating expenses offset by an increase of clinical and regulatory expenses due to increased consulting and travel related expenses as a result of the meeting with the circulatory systems device panel on may  we expect total research and development expenses in to slightly increase as compared to  while costs associated with clinical and regulatory expenses will decrease as compared to the costs associated with research and pre clinical programs and clinical development programs were approximately in thousands december  research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development clinical trials of our products and regulatory approval efforts have required substantial financial and management resources 
in addition  the clinical trials may identify significant technical or other obstacles that we will have to overcome before obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or market acceptance 
our failure to complete our clinical trials  demonstrate product safety and clinical effectiveness  and obtain regulatory approval for the use of our microcatheter system for the ablation of atrial fibrillation would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainties relating to clinical trials  demonstrating product safety and clinical effectiveness and obtaining regulatory approval for the use of our 
table of contents microcatheter system in ablation make it difficult for us to accurately predict the time or cost until completion of any product development efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased by to  from  in selling expenses for decreased to  from  in selling expenses decreased due to the reduction in workforce of employees  including the associated decrease in compensation  benefits  travel and general operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses for increased to  from  in the net increase of  was primarily due to additional expenses incurred following the replacement of a senior officer  including accrued compensation for severance  non cash stock compensation for the vesting of options for both the former and the replacement officer and related legal expenditures 
marketing expenses for increased to  from  in the increase was due primarily to compensation and benefits and increased marketing of our surgical ablation system after receiving k clearance for that system in 
we expect sales expenses to increase in if the fda approval is obtained for the revelation tx in the united states 
in general  we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to increase slightly during  as we prepare for the launch of our therapeutic family of products in the united states 
interest and other income  and interest expense interest and other income for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to average yields on cash equivalents declining from in to in we expect interest and other income to remain approximately the same in compared to interest expense for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to the expiration and buyout of capital lease obligations 
we expect interest expense to remain relatively stable in as compared to other non cash expense other non cash expense for the year ended december  was  no such expense was recorded for the same period in this non cash expense relates to the warrants issued in connection with our august private placement  and represents the difference in the warrants valuation between their dates of issuance and the registration of the shares underlying the warrants 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales for the year ended december   revenues increased to  from  in us sales remained relatively flat  decreasing only to  from  european sales increased to  from  due to increased therapeutic revenues primarily related to the revelation helix  which was introduced in early sales in the asia pacific market increased to  from  due to higher diagnostic product sales in this region 
sales in the rest of the world remained flat with sales in of  compared to sales of  in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs  catheter fabrication costs  system assembly and testing costs and manufacturing overhead 
cost of goods sold for decreased to  from  for the decrease of cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the reduced impact of under absorption of overhead costs due to the  increase in sales volume to  in from  in production operated at approximately of capacity and overall the standard 
table of contents cost was reduced due to the allocation of fixed costs over an increased number of units produced and tighter controls of costs for purchased material 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in the decrease was due to lower costs associated with revelation tx product development  which was partially offset by higher product development expenses for the revelation helix and the cardima ablation system which received fda clearance in early as part of the surgical ablation system 
the costs associated with research and pre clinical programs and clinical development programs were approximately in thousands year ended december  research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to  from  in selling expenses for decreased to  from  in marketing expenses for decreased to  from  in the increase was due primarily to the addition of a product manager to prepare for the launch of our therapeutic marketing campaign 
interest and other income  interest expense interest and other income for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to average yields declining from in to in and to lower average cash and investment balances in as compared to interest expense for decreased to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to the payoff of a line of credit and a buyout of certain capital lease obligations 
gain on sale of intellectual property the gain on sale of intellectual property in was due to the sale of a portion of our patent portfolio and related intellectual property pertaining to intra vascular sensing and signal detection and certain guiding catheters to medtronic  inc for an aggregate purchase price of  in december we received  of the purchase price 
the remaining  was received in january  upon completion of the remaining transfer obligations under the agreement 
there were no such sales of our patent portfolio since then 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of march  our management believes that our cash balances as of march  will be sufficient to fund planned expenditures into the fourth quarter of although our management recognizes the need to raise funds in the near future there can be no assurances that we will be successful in consummating any such transaction  or  if we do consummate such a transaction  that the terms and conditions of such financing will not be unfavorable to us 
any failure by us to obtain additional funding will have a material effect upon us and will likely results in our inability to continue as a going concern 
our independent auditors have concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  and have  therefore  modified their report in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 

table of contents we have financed our operations to date principally through private placements of equity securities  which have resulted in net proceeds of approximately  through december   the initial public offering of our common stock in june  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately  together with interest income on such proceeds  borrowings under a  former line of credit  sale of certain of our non core patents to medtronic for  and equipment leases to finance certain capital equipment which have provided proceeds in the amount of  as of december  we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulted primarily from operating losses incurred

net cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting primarily from the sale of equity securities in private placement transactions and borrowings under the line of credit during such periods 
contractual commitments following is a schedule of future contractual commitments at december  in thousands operating lease capital leases employment agreements purchase obligations year ending december  total minimum payments required our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including sales and marketing activities  the progress of our product development efforts  the progress of our clinical trials  actions relating to regulatory matters  the costs and timing of expansion of product development  manufacturing  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance and other competitive developments 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our management expects to continue to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future as we complete new product development and commercialization 
equity financings since early  our principal source of the cash needed to fund our operations has been private placements of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
in recent years  we have been required to effect these equity financings at a discount to the then prevailing market price of our common stock  and in june  we obtained our stockholders approval for the issuance of up to  shares at a discount through december  the following summarizes our equity financings over the last three years  including the cash and equity fees that we have paid to financial advisors in connection with those financings

factors affecting future results you should carefully consider in their entirety the following risk factors and all other information in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial also may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and in some instances our ability to continue as a going concern could be adversely affected 
in addition to historical information  this prospectus contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
if we fail to raise additional capital when needed  our business will fail 
we have limited cash resources and will need to raise additional capital through public or private financings or other arrangements in order to complete our clinical trials  obtain necessary regulatory approvals  manufacture and market our products and fund our other expenses 
in addition  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of completing the development  approval and marketing of our products or in other aspects of our business 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available to us when needed  if at all  or  if available  will be obtained on terms attractive to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital  we may be forced to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product research and development programs  to limit the marketing of our products  or to license or sell to third parties the rights to commercialize our products or technologies that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves 
furthermore  debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could affect our ability to raise additional capital 
our failure to raise capital when needed could cause us to cease our operations 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the private placement of equity securities  proceeds from our initial public offering in june  loan facilities and the sale of certain of our patents and other intellectual property 
although our management recognizes the need to raise funds in the near future  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any fundraising transaction  or if we do consummate such a transaction  that its the terms and conditions will not be unfavorable to us 
among other things  the agreements under which we issued some of our existing securities include  and any securities that we may issue in the future may also include  terms that could impede our ability to raise additional funding  such as terms requiring the consent of certain security holders before we issue additional securities 
the issuance of additional securities will likely dilute the interests of existing common stockholders  and could impose additional restrictions on how we operate and finance our business 
we have sold a limited number of our microcatheter products  and we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future 
we have sold only a limited number of our microcatheter systems 
in addition  we will continue to incur substantial losses into the foreseeable future because of research and product development  clinical trials  regulatory approval efforts and manufacturing  sales  marketing and other expenses as we seek to obtain necessary approvals and bring our microcatheters to market 
since our inception  we have experienced losses  and we expect to experience substantial net losses into the foreseeable future 

table of contents our net losses were approximately million  million and for the years ended december   and respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our limited sales history and the uncertainties associated with our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for our products make it difficult to assess our future results 
we cannot be certain that we will ever generate substantial revenue or achieve profitability 
our failure to generate substantial revenues would harm our business 
our need to raise additional capital in the future could have a dilutive effect on your investment 
in order to complete the required regulatory approval process and commercialize our products  we will need to raise additional capital 
one possibility for raising additional capital is the public or private sale of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
if we sell additional shares of our common stock  such sales will further dilute the percentage of our equity that you own 
in addition  our recent private placement financings have involved the issuance of securities at a price per share that represented a discount to the closing price of our common stock and it is possible that we will close future private placements involving the issuance of securities at a discount to prevailing market prices 
depending upon the price per share of securities that we sell in the future  your interest in us could be further diluted by any adjustments to the number of shares and the applicable exercise price required pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which we previously issued securities 
no assurance can be given that previous or future investors  finders or placement agents will not claim that they are entitled to additional antidilution adjustments or dispute the company s calculation of any such adjustments 
any such claim or dispute could require us to incur material costs and expenses regardless of the resolution and  if resolved unfavorably to us  to effect dilutive securities issuances or adjustments to previously issued securities 
in addition  certain of our prior securities issuances have included  and future financings may also include  provisions requiring us to make additional payments to the investors if we fail to obtain or maintain the effectiveness of sec registration statements by specified dates or take other specified action 
our ability to meet these requirements may depend on actions by regulators and other third parties  over which we will have no control 
these provisions may require us to make payments or issue additional dilutive securities  or could lead to costly and disruptive disputes 
in addition  these provisions could require us to record additional non cash expenses  as we were required to do in the third quarter of with respect to certain warrants issued in that quarter 
the audit report accompanying our financial statements indicates there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of our losses to date and accumulated deficit  the audit report on our financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our continuation as a going concern will depend upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitable operations 
concern about our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our obligations or adversely affect the terms of any additional funding we are able to obtain 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses until successful commercialization of one or more of our products 
there can be no assurance that we can or will operate profitably in the future  or that we will continue as a going concern 
we have entered into engagement letters in connection with our actual and proposed private placements that have in the past and may in future lead to disputes and also may lead to additional payments of cash or issuances of securities in connection with past or future sales of our securities 
in connection with our private placement of units of common stock and warrants in  we entered into a letter agreement in april  or the letter agreement  with a financial advisor 
this financial advisor  or the advisor  assisted us with our private placement of units and received a commission in connection with the offering 

table of contents on july   we retained a different financial advisor  or the july advisor  in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with the july advisor  or the july letter agreement  provides for the payment of fees to the july advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering 
in addition to the cash fee  the july advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase that number of shares of our common stock equal to of the number of shares sold in the offering 
the july advisor will also receive cash proceeds equal to of the aggregate exercise price of any warrants issued to the investors in the offering and subsequently exercised 
shortly before the august  closing of our august private placement which was arranged by the july advisor  the advisor communicated to us that it believes that it is entitled under the letter agreement to fees and warrants in connection with the august private placement 
we strongly disagree with the advisor s interpretation of the letter agreement 
even if the advisor s interpretation is determined to be correct  we believe that the advisor waived any rights to compensation it might have in connection with the august private placement 
we sent to the advisor on august  a termination letter relating to the letter agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement  our obligations to pay the advisor a commission or to issue to it warrants in connection with sales of our securities terminated thirty days from the date of this termination letter  or september  on august   the advisor sent to us an invoice for cash commissions and warrants that the advisor claims are owed to it pursuant to the letter agreement as a result of the closing of the august private placement 
on september   we sent a letter to the advisor to express our position that no fees or warrants are due to the advisor in connection with the closings of the august private placement 
on september  we received a letter from legal counsel to the advisor reasserting the advisor s claim that it must receive payment of commissions and warrants in connection with the august private placement 
in the event the advisor prevails on any claims in connection with the august private placement  we would be required to pay to the advisor  or of the gross proceeds that we received from the sale of shares of common stock  and issue to the advisor warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  or of the number of shares of common stock sold in the august private placement 
in the event of the warrants issued to the investors in the august private placement are exercised  we would be required to pay to the advisor an additional cash amount equal to  or of the aggregate exercise price of those warrants 
any payments to the advisor or warrants issued to the advisor would be in addition to placement fees and warrants paid to the july advisor in connection with the terms of the july letter agreement 
on november   we retained a party to act as our financial advisor and finder in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the november advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the november advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
in addition to the cash fee  the november advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities sold in such offering 
the letter agreement also provided for the payment of a cash fee of  upon execution of the agreement  and a break up fee of  net of the fee paid upon execution for financings or transactions undertaken by us without the november advisor s assistance 
the december and january closings of our private placement were undertaken without the november advisor s assistance  and in april we paid to the november advisor a net break up fee of  on april   we terminated this letter agreement  effective may  in a letter dated september   this former advisor claimed that under its november  agreement with us  we are obligated to pay such advisor cash fees of  and warrants to purchase units of the company s securities compromising  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of at an exercise price per unit of  in connection with four enumerated purchasers investments in our august 
table of contents private placement 
the letter also stated that the november advisor believed that the company would have additional obligations to the advisor in the event that it was determined that other investors in the august private placement were investors as to which the november advisor is entitled to compensation under its november  agreement with us 
in a letter dated january   the november advisor advised us that it was no longer claiming compensation with respect to one of the four purchasers  reduced its claim to cash fees of  and warrants to purchase units comprising  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  submitted information alleged to support a portion of its claim  and stated its belief we are obligated to register the claimed securities for resale 
in our opinion  the november advisor has not established the merit of this claim 
we cannot predict whether additional claims will be made  or the resolution of any current or future claims  by this former advisor 
on december   we retained another party as our financial advisor and finder in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the december advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the december advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
in addition to the cash fee  the december advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities issued in such offering 
on december   we retained another party as our financial advisor and finder in connection with the sale of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that closed on december  and january  this finder received a cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of in connection with the december  and january  closings of our private placements 
on january   we entered into a new letter agreement with this finder  or the january finder  to act as our financial advisor and finder in connection with the offer and sale of shares of company common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that closed on march  and april  the january finder received  shares of our common stock upon execution of the letter agreement 
the letter agreement with this finder also provides for the payment of fees to the january finder equal to of the gross proceeds of the march  and april  closings of the private placement received from investors introduced to us by the january finder  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants and those warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of shares sold in the march  and april  closings of the private placement to those investors 
on march   we retained another party as our financial advisor in connection with a proposed debt or equity financing 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the march advisor  provided for  among other things  the payment of fees to the advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering and warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities issued in such offering at of the market price 
we terminated this letter agreement  effective may  the march advisor has acknowledged and agreed to the terms of that termination  including that no fees are owed by us under this letter agreement 
despite the termination letter that we delivered to the advisor on august  terminating our obligations to pay the advisor a commission or to issue them warrants in connection with sales of our securities after september   we received on january   a letter from the advisor asserting that it also is owed i approximately  plus ii five year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of the our common stock at an exercise price of per share  in each case arising in connection with a private placement of securities consummated by us in december in addition  on february  we received another letter from the advisor asserting that it is also owed i approximately  plus ii five year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  in each case in connection with the january  closing of our private placement 
any payments to the advisor or warrants issued to the advisor would be in addition to placement fees and warrants paid to the december finder pursuant to the terms of our letter agreement with the december finder 

table of contents we have not yet received a letter from the advisor claiming additional fees or warrants in connection with the march  april  august and december closings of our recent financings  but there can be no guarantee that such a claim will not be made in connection with any prior or future financing 
in connection with the march  and april  closings of our private placement  in addition to the cash fee and warrants to purchase common stock issued to the january finder  i the july advisor received an aggregate cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  ii the november advisor received an aggregate cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of and iii the december advisor received an aggregate cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  in each case  for placement of securities with parties introduced through the respective advisor 
on july   we retained another party as our financial advisor in connection with a proposed debt or equity financing 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the july  advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the advisor equal to of the purchase price of shares sold to purchasers introduced to us by the july  advisor and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock per million raised by this advisor up to a maximum of  shares at a price per share of 
on july   we retained another party as our financial advisor in connection with a proposed equity financing 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the july  agent  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the agent equal to of the gross subscription proceeds of any equity offering by us from purchasers procured by the agent 
in addition to the cash fee  the agent has the right to receive warrants to purchase six percent for every dollar raised by the july  agent in connection with the placement at an exercise price equal to of the closing bid price of our common stock on the date of the closing 
pursuant to an oral agreement entered into in august  we retained another party as our financial advisor in connection with a proposed debt or equity financing 
our oral agreement with this advisor  or the august advisor  provides for cash fees and warrants to be issued to this advisor with respect to investors introduced by this advisor  at the same rates as described above with respect to the july  advisor 
in connection with the august private placement  we paid to the july  advisor  the july  agent and the august advisor aggregate cash fees of approximately  in addition  the advisors received warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we subsequently agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain of these warrants to to encourage the adviser to exercise them for cash in march in august  one of the foregoing advisors notified us of such advisor s belief that it was entitled to an additional fee of approximately  and additional warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock in connection with the august private placement 
we responded that  based on the information in our possession  we believe that such advisor is not entitled to such fees and warrants 
to date  we have received no further information from such advisor in support of its claim 
on november   we entered into another letter agreement with the july  advisor  which provides for  among other things  the payment of cash fees to the july  advisor equal to seven percent of our gross proceeds of sales of stock to purchasers whose purchases are procured by the july  advisor or its designated dealers before the expiration of the agreement 
in addition to the cash fee  the july  advisor has a right to four year warrants to purchase shares of common stock equal in number to of the common stock sold to investors procured by this advisor at an exercise price per share equal to one hundred ten percent of the per share price paid at the closing 
in connection with the closing of our december private placement  we paid this advisor and its designated dealers  and the july  agent cash fees equal to  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices that range from to per share 

table of contents due to the existence of these various letter agreements  there is a possibility that we may be obligated to pay fees  cash commissions  and issue warrants to one or more financial advisors in connection with closings of any of our private placements 
in addition  we may in the future enter into further agreements with financial advisors  finders or placement agents  similar to those discussed above  in connection with private placements or public offerings of our securities 
we might agree to pay to these parties a commission on any sales of securities to investors introduced to us by such parties or a commission based upon the exercise price of any warrants or other securities exercised by investors introduced to us by such parties  and that such commissions will be in addition to commissions payable to other financial advisors  finders and placement agents working on our behalf 
in addition  we may agree to issue to these additional financial advisors  finders and placement agents securities such as warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  which could dilute your investment in us 
we also may be obligated to pay termination or break up fees to our current or future financial advisors  finders and placement agents in connection with our financings 
these commissions paid or warrants or other securities issued may be in addition to the commissions payable or securities issuable to other financial advisors  finders or placement agents in respect of the same transaction  and could be substantial 
disputes have arisen from time to time concerning our financial advisors entitlement to cash and equity compensation associated with our past financings  and additional disputes may arise in the future 
we have limited sales and limited experience in the sale  marketing and distribution of our products 
our failure to establish an effective direct or indirect sales and marketing force will cause our revenues to decline 
we have only limited experience marketing and selling our products in commercial quantities 
currently  we are solely responsible for marketing and distributing our products in the united states 
we had previously signed an exclusive three year distribution agreement with st 
jude medical corporation in  but st 
jude did not meet the first year minimum annual sales quota under the distribution agreement and  in june  we mutually agreed with st 
jude to terminate the agreement 
if we receive fda approval of our pma for revelation tx  we may not have an adequate marketing and sales force to adequately sell our product 
expanding our marketing and sales capability to support sales in commercial quantities adequately will require substantial effort and require significant management and financial resources 
our failure to establish an effective sales and marketing force will prevent us from being able to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products 
we also have terminated several distribution arrangements in europe because of the distributors failure to meet minimum sales levels under those agreements 
our ability to operate a remote sales force effectively will require additional resources  time and expense  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to build a european distribution or direct business  that it will be cost effective or that its efforts will be successful 
failure to establish an adequate business in europe would harm our business 
currently  sales and marketing of our pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation and tracer microcatheter systems are conducted through a number of exclusive distributors in certain european countries and japan and a direct salesperson in europe 
we have sold only a limited number of pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation and tracer microcatheter systems through these distributors 
we cannot be certain that these distributors will be able to effectively market and sell our products in international markets 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional agreements with desired distributors on a timely basis or at all  or that these distributors will devote adequate resources to selling our products 
our failure to establish and maintain appropriate distribution relationships would harm our business 

table of contents we rely on multiple third parties to conduct and collect data for the clinical trials of our products 
if we are unable to access this data or the fda refuses to accept the data in a filing  the commercialization of our products will be delayed and our business will be harmed 
we often rely on multiple third parties  such as hospitals and universities  to conduct and collect data for our clinical trials 
we depend on these third parties to provide access to data and cooperate with us in completing regulatory filings for the approval or clearance of our products 
in order for the fda and other regulatory agencies to accept and rely on the data of a filing  the data collection  analysis and summarization must meet certain standards 
we cannot be certain that the clinical data collected by the third parties meet the standards of the fda or other regulatory agencies 
if we are unable to rely on the clinical data collected by third parties  or if these third parties do not perform their contractual obligations  the fda or other regulatory agencies may require us to gather additional clinical data 
this could significantly delay commercialization of our products  require us to spend additional capital on our clinical trials and harm our business 
we cannot assure the safety or effectiveness of our products 
to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals and secure the confidence of physicians and others whose acceptance is needed for our products  we will need to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective 
we cannot assure you that our products will be deemed safe and effective 
many of our products  such as our surgical ablation system which has begun to be used by cardiac surgeons only recently  have not been used to a sufficient extent to permit us to predict their safety and effectiveness 
in addition  our products include components and materials supplied by third parties  whose safety and reliability we cannot guarantee 
we have occasionally experienced quality issues with some elements of our products  and we may face additional issues in the future 
the perceived safety and effectiveness of our products can also depend on their manner of use by physicians and other third parties  which we cannot control 
if safety and effectiveness issues arise with any of our products in the future  we may incur liabilities to third parties  lose any regulatory approvals for the applicable product  or be required to redesign the product 
these issues will reduce our sales and increase our expenses  possibly substantially 
our microcatheter products and their related procedures are novel to the market and will require the special training of physicians 
if the market does not accept our products and procedures  our revenues will decline 
our microcatheter systems represent a novel approach to diagnosing and treating atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia 
acceptance of our products and procedures by physicians  patients and health care payors will be necessary in order for us to be successful 
if the market does not accept our products and the procedures involved in their use  our business would be harmed and our revenues would decline 
our microcatheter products must be safe  effective and cost efficient in order for them to effectively compete against more established treatments 
if we cannot compete with these treatments  our revenues will decline 
the market for catheters to diagnose or treat atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia is highly competitive 
our microcatheter systems for the mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are new technologies 
safety  cost efficiency and effectiveness are the primary competitive factors in this market 
other competitive factors include the length of time required for products to be developed and receive regulatory approval and  in some cases  reimbursement approval 
existing treatments with which we must compete include conventional catheters using the drag and burn or dot to dot technique  anti arrhythmic and anti coagulant drugs  external electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythms and defibrillation  implantable defibrillators  
table of contents purposeful destruction of the atrial ventricular node followed by implantation of a pacemaker  and open heart surgery known as the maze procedure 
physicians will not recommend the use of our microcatheter systems unless they can conclude that our systems provide a safe  effective and cost efficient alternative to current technologies for the mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia 
if our clinical data and other studies do not show that our products are safe and effective  the fda and other regulators will not approve our products for sale 
if our products are not approved  we will not be able to enter the market and we will not be able to generate revenues from their sale 
none of our ablation products for electrophysiology have received regulatory approval in the united states 
continued failure to receive these approvals will harm our business 
to date  none of our products in development for the ablation of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia has received regulatory approval in the united states 
if we cannot gain us regulatory approval  our business will be materially harmed 
even if our ablation products are successfully developed and we obtain the required regulatory approvals  we cannot be certain that our ablation products and their associated procedures will ultimately gain market acceptance 
because our sole product focus is to design and market microcatheter systems to map and ablate atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  our failure to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize these systems would materially harm our business 
we must obtain governmental approvals or clearances before we can sell our products 
our products are considered to be medical devices and are subject to regulation in the united states and internationally 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design and development  product testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance and approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
before we can market any of our products in the united states or europe  we must demonstrate that our products are safe and effective and obtain approval or clearance from the applicable governmental authorities 
in the united states  we must obtain from the fda k pre market notification clearance or a pma in order to market a product 
we have received k pre market notification clearances for our pathfinder  pathfinder mini and tracer microcatheter systems for mapping ventricular tachycardia  for the revelation microcatheter system for mapping atrial fibrillation and for the cardima ablation system to ablate cardiac tissue during cardiac surgery using radio frequency energy 
currently  the process for k clearance requires approximately days and pma approval is six to twelve months 
however  the timing of such processes can be uncertain and may involve significantly more time 
we cannot guarantee either the timing or receipt of regulatory approval or clearance for any of our products in development 
these products may require a pma  and the fda may request extensive clinical data to support either k clearance or a pma 
we are required to seek a pma for our ablation products  including the revelation tx microcatheter 
the process of obtaining a pma is much more expensive  lengthy and uncertain than the k pre market notification clearance process 
in order to complete our pma application  we will be required to complete 
table of contents clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of these products 
in december  the fda approved a patient atrial fibrillation feasibility study for mapping and ablation with the revelation tx 
in june  we received conditional approval from the fda and full approval in august for our phase iii clinical trial 
in march  the fda allowed us to file a modular pma for our revelation tx in phase iii clinical trial 
under the modular pma submission  we filed four of five modules in the fifth module is the clinical data and formal pma application 
three of the first four modules have been accepted and closed by the fda and the remaining module has been left open for reference during the review of the clinical data in the fifth and final module 
on september   we submitted our pma application to the fda with the fifth module containing data on more than patients treated with our revelation tx microcatheter system 
subsequently  on november   we announced that the fda had accepted our filing and granted our request for expedited review 
on march   we were notified by the fda that we would meet with the circulatory systems device panel on may  on may   the circulatory system devices panel unanimously recommended that the fda not approve our pma for the revelation tx linear ablation microcatheter system 
the circulatory system devices panel commented favorably on the safety and need for this type of device 
however  the panel felt that efficacy data was not sufficiently clear and supportive for the approval 
the panel provided the fda and the company with several suggestions on how to possibly reexamine the existing data or how to collect more data on existing patients 
on june   we received a letter from the fda  which reiterated the recommendation of the panel and stated the fda concurred with the recommendation of the panel 
on january   we submitted an amended pma that provides new analysis  including data from an expanded patient base  to the fda 
the timing and outcome of the fda s consideration of any submission are currently uncertain 
we are restricted from selling the product until the entire pma process is complete and approved by the fda 
no assurance can be given that we will ever be able to obtain a pma for any of our ablation products 
our failure to obtain a pma on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we filed an investigational device exemption  or ide  application for a feasibility trial with the therastream microcatheter system in december and received permission to expand that trial in july we have postponed the therastream clinical trial while we focus our resources on completing our atrial fibrillation phase iii clinical trial 
there can be no assurance that any additional clinical studies that we may propose will be permitted by the fda  will be completed or  if completed  will provide data and information that supports a pma 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that our phase iii clinical trial for ablation of atrial fibrillation will provide us with data and information that supports a pma 
regulatory agencies may limit the indications for which they approve or clear any of our products 
further  the fda or regulatory agencies in other countries may restrict or withdraw approval or clearance of a product if additional information becomes available to support such action 
delays in the approval or clearance process  limitation of our labeling claims or denial of our applications or notifications would cause our business to be materially and adversely affected 
pre clinical and clinical trials are inherently unpredictable 
if we do not successfully conduct these trials  we may be unable to market our products and our revenues may decline 
through pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we must demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for their indicated uses 
results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials may not allow us to predict results in later stage testing 
no assurance can be given that our future clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our products or will result in regulatory approval to market our products 
as a result  if we are unable to commence and complete our clinical trials as planned  or demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products  our business will be harmed 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we can begin any future clinical trials or successfully complete these trials once started 
we may never meet our development schedule for any of our products in development 
even if a product is successfully developed and 
table of contents clinically tested  we cannot be certain that it will be approved by the fda or other regulatory agency on a timely basis or at all 
if the fda does not approve our products for commercial sales  our business will be harmed 
as described above  we have devoted considerable resources to developing  testing and seeking regulatory approval for our revelation tx microcatheter systems designed for ablation of atrial fibrillation 
on may   the fda s circulatory system devices panel recommended that the fda not approve our premarket approval application  or pma  for the revelation tx linear ablation microcatheter system 
on june   we received a letter from the fda  which reiterated the recommendation of the panel and stated the fda concurred with the recommendation of the panel 
on january   we submitted an amended pma to the fda  but the timing and outcome of any response from the fda are currently uncertain 
we must receive pma approval before marketing our products for ablation in the united states 
additionally  in august  we began a clinical trial in germany involving our revelation helix microcatheter in the treatment of atrial fibrillation originating from the pulmonary veins 
enrollment in this study was completed in june by december  all enrolled study subjects had completed the six month follow up 
data from the six month follow up on these subjects will be analyzed and prepared for publication targeted for the fourth quarter of in december   the revelation helix received the ce mark allowing sales in the european economic area 
we also received in december approval for an ide to begin clinical testing of our therastream microcatheter system for ablation of ventricular tachycardia and during calendar year approval to expand that trial  however  we have postponed the clinical feasibility trial for the therastream microcatheter system for ablation of ventricular tachycardia to focus on completing our revelation tx clinical trial for atrial fibrillation 
we have no estimate as to when  or if  we will resume the clinical trial for our therastream microcatheter system 
if we resume the clinical trial for our therastream microcatheter system  the completion of this clinical trial could take several years 
clinical trial of our microcatheter systems will require substantial financial and management resources 
in addition  the clinical trials may identify significant technical or other obstacles that we will need to overcome before obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or market acceptance 
our failure to complete our clinical trials  demonstrate product safety and clinical effectiveness  or obtain regulatory approval for the use of our microcatheter system for the ablation of atrial fibrillation would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials could increase our expenses and harm our business 
the rate at which we may complete our pre clinical and clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the procedure  the proximity of patients residences to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and impact of other clinical studies competing for the same patient population and or the same physicians time and research efforts 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays  which could cause our business results to suffer 
if we do not comply with applicable domestic laws and regulations after obtaining approvals or clearances  our business results may suffer 
after initial regulatory approval or clearance of our products  we will continue to be subject to extensive domestic regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the fda  and other regulatory agencies  including  but not limited to fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  withdrawal of marketing approvals or clearances  
table of contents refusal by the fda to grant clearances or approvals  and civil and criminal penalties 
we also are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulations for all of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulations through periodic inspections  including a pre approval inspection for pma products 
the quality system regulations relates to product testing and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we do not  or any third party manufacturer of our products does not  comply with the quality system regulations and cannot be brought into compliance  we will be required to find alternative manufacturers 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers would likely be a long and difficult process 
we also are required to provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our medical devices  as well as product malfunctions that could contribute to death or serious injury 
foreign regulatory agencies may also impose burdensome and costly requirements on us 
if we fail to comply with these applicable regulations  we may incur substantial business disruption  expenses  penalties  fines and other liabilities and our business results  and financial conditions will suffer 
if we do not comply with foreign regulatory requirements to market our products outside the united states  our business will be harmed 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required for approval varies from country to country and may be longer or shorter than the time required in the united states 
in order to market any of our products in the member countries of the european union  we are required to obtain ce mark certification 
ce mark certification is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the european medical device directives 
we have received ce mark certification to sell our pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation  revelation tx  revelation helix  and tracer microcatheters and venaport  vueport and naviport guiding catheters for mapping in the european union 
we received approval to sell our pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation  and tracer in japan and australia  and to sell our pathfinder  tracer  venaport  vueport and naviport in canada 
we also received ce mark certification to sell our revelation  revelation tx  revelation t flex  revelation helix  revelation helix st and revelation helix stx microcatheter systems for both mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation  permitting us to market these products in the member countries of the european union 
we intend to submit data in support of additional ce mark applications 
however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the ce mark for any of our products  as the case may be 
failure to receive or maintain approval to affix the ce mark would prohibit us from selling these products in member countries of the european union  and would require significant delays in obtaining individual country approvals 
no assurance can be given that we will ever obtain or maintain such approvals 
if we do not receive or maintain these approvals  our business could be harmed 
in july  we received a section letter intention to suspend a medical device license from the medical devices bureau of the health products and food branch of health canada 
on december   after meeting with the medical devices bureau and providing additional analysis from our current trial  we received notification from the bureau that the medical device license would not be suspended 
we may receive similar notices in the future from us or foreign agencies relating to approvals previously obtained or pending regulatory submissions 

table of contents reuse of our single use products could cause our revenues to decline 
although we label all of our microcatheter systems for single use only  we are aware that some physicians potentially may reuse these products 
reuse of our microcatheter systems could reduce revenues from product sales and could cause our revenues to decline 
in addition  such misuse of our products could result in personal injury and death 
see factors affecting future results we may face product liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products 
difficulties presented by international factors could negatively affect our business 
a component of our strategy is to expand our international sales revenues 
we believe that we will face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically 
among the international risks we believe are most likely to affect us are export license requirements for our products  exchange rate fluctuations or currency controls  changes in the regulation of medical products by the european union or other international regulatory agencies  the difficulty in managing a direct sales force from abroad  the financial condition  expertise and performance of our international distributors and any future international distributors  domestic or international trade restrictions  or changes in tariffs 
any of these factors could damage our business results 
we may be unable to successfully commercialize our microcatheter products  as the industry for them is highly competitive 
the market for catheters to map and or ablate atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia is highly competitive 
several of our competitors are developing different approaches and products for these procedures 
these approaches include mapping systems using contact mapping  single point spatial mapping and noncontact  multi site electrical mapping technologies  and ablation systems using radio frequency  ultrasound  microwave  laser and cryoblation technologies 
other companies are also developing surgical procedures that could allow physicians to perform the open heart surgical maze procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in a minimally invasive manner 
if any of these new approaches or products proves to be safe  effective and cost effective  our products could be rendered non competitive or obsolete  which would harm our business 
many of our competitors have an established presence in the field of interventional cardiology and electrophysiology  or the study of the electrical system of the heart 
these competitors include cr bard  inc medtronic  inc  boston scientific  through its ep technologies and cardiac pathways divisions  johnson johnson  through its biosense webster division  and st 
jude medical  inc  through its daig division 
these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  including larger research and development staffs and greater experience and capabilities in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing  marketing and distributing products 
in addition  other companies are developing proprietary systems for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias  including biosense webster  a division of johnson johnson  and endocardial solutions  inc other companies are also developing  marketing and selling alternative approaches for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  including manufacturers of implantable defibrillators such as guidant corporation  medtronic  inc and st 
jude medical  inc 
we cannot be certain that we will succeed in developing and marketing technologies and products that are 
table of contents safer  more clinically effective and cost effective than the more established treatments or the new approaches and products being developed and marketed by our competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in developing new technologies and products that will be available before those of our competitors 
our failure to demonstrate the competitive advantages and achieve market acceptance of our products would significantly harm our business 
we license portions of our product technology from potential competitors  and the termination of any of these licenses would harm our business 
we rely on license agreements for some of our product technology from potential competitors 
a license from target therapeutics  inc  a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  is the technological basis for our microcatheter systems for mapping and ablation 
boston scientific corporation currently has research efforts in the field of electrophysiology that may compete with our products 
under the target therapeutics license agreement we have an exclusive license under specific issued united states patents 
the exclusive license from target therapeutics covers the diagnosis and treatment of electrophysiological disorders in areas other than the central nervous system 
in addition  we have obtained a non exclusive license to use target therapeutics technology  provided we have made a substantial improvement of such technology  for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases of the heart  other than by balloon angioplasty 
the license will terminate upon the expiration or invalidation of all claims under the underlying patents 
in addition  target therapeutics has the right to terminate the license earlier if we fail to comply with various commercialization  sublicensing  insurance  royalty  product liability  indemnification  non competition and other obligations 
furthermore  either party can terminate the license if a material breach remains uncured for thirty days or if either party ceases to be actively engaged in its present business for a period of twelve months 
the loss of our exclusive rights to the target therapeutics based microcatheter technology would significantly harm our business 
in december  we sold certain patents and related intellectual property pertaining to intravascular sensing and signal detection to medtronic  inc  which currently has research efforts in the field of electrophysiology that may compete with our products 
we received a perpetual  worldwide license at no cost from medtronic to use these patents and related intellectual property in our products for mapping and ablation of arrhythmia causing tissue 
in addition  medtronic agreed not to sublicense the patents within our field of use to any non affiliated party 
we have also licensed a proprietary surface coating material from another vendor used on certain of our microcatheters 
we cannot be certain that these licenses will continue to be available to us or will be available to us on reasonable terms 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in commercial shipments until we could internally develop or identify  license and integrate equivalent technology 
these delays would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to commercialize our products under development if they infringe existing patents or patents that have not yet issued 
we believe that our patent applications and products do not interfere with existing patents 
however  we cannot be sure that relevant patents have not been issued that could block our ability to obtain patents or commercialize our products 
moreover  because us patent applications are not a matter of public record  a patent application could currently be on file that would prevent us from obtaining a patent issuance 
in addition  congress recently amended the us patent laws to exempt physicians  other health care professionals and affiliated entities from infringement liability for medical and surgical procedures performed on patients 
the issuance of any potentially competing patent could harm our business 
we have received in the past and expect to continue to receive letters from others threatening to enforce patent or other intellectual rights against us 
we cannot be certain that we will not become subject to patent or intellectual property infringement claims or litigation  interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark 
table of contents office to determine the priority of inventions  or oppositions to patent grants in foreign countries 
any such claim  litigation or proceeding  regardless of the outcome  would likely require us to expend substantial defense costs and would disrupt our business 
an adverse determination in litigation  interference or opposition proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to cease using important technology invalidate our intellectual property rights  or require us to license disputed rights from third parties 
however  we cannot be certain that any licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain such a license could materially delay the commercialization of our products  require us to expend substantial resources to design and develop alternative to the disputed technology  and otherwise harm our business 
our license with target therapeutics does not provide us with indemnification against claims brought by third parties alleging infringement of patent rights 
consequently  we would bear the liability resulting from such claims 
we cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources to protect and defend our intellectual property  as such defense is often costly and time consuming 
our failure to protect our patent rights  trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property would harm our business 
if healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products  the market may not accept our products and our revenues may decline 
us healthcare providers  including hospitals and physicians  that purchase microcatheter products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or a part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed using our products 
the success of our products will depend upon the ability of healthcare providers to obtain satisfactory reimbursement for medical procedures in which our microcatheter systems are used 
if these healthcare providers are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  the market may not accept our products and our revenues may decline 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate regulatory clearances or approvals  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
if we receive fda clearance or approval  third party reimbursement also would depend upon decisions by the united states health care financing administration for medicare  as well as by individual health maintenance organizations  private insurers and other payors 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals may be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products will be available domestically or internationally  if available  that such reimbursement will be available in sufficient amounts in the united states or in international markets under either government or private reimbursement systems  or that physicians will support and advocate reimbursement for procedures using our products 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors or changes in government and private third party payor policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products would harm our business 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to manufacture our products in high volumes at commercially reasonable costs 
we currently manufacture our microcatheter systems in limited quantities for us and international sales and for pre clinical and clinical trials 
however  we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the amounts necessary to achieve significant commercial sales 
we expect that if us sales for the pathfinder microcatheter products  revelation microcatheter products  and our surgical ablation system  increase or if we receive fda clearance or approvals for other products  we will need to expend significant capital resources 
table of contents and develop additional manufacturing capacity to establish large scale manufacturing capabilities 
however  we could encounter problems related to capacity constraints  production yields  quality control  and shortages of qualified personnel 
such problems could affect our ability to adequately scale up production of our products and fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  which could harm our business 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
our operations must either undergo quality system regulations compliance inspections conducted by the fda or receive an fda exemption from such compliance inspections in order for the fda to permit us to produce products for sale in the united states 
our facilities and manufacturing processes are subject to inspections from time to time by the fda  the state of california and european notified bodies 
we have demonstrated compliance with en iso or iso quality standards  as well as compliance with eec  the medical device directive 
we comply with procedures to produce products for sale in europe 
any failure by us to comply with the quality system regulations requirements or to maintain our compliance with en iso or iso standards and eec  the medical device directive  will require us to take corrective actions  such as modification of our policies and procedures 
in addition  we may be required to cease all or part of our operations for some period of time until we can demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken to comply with quality system regulations or en iso or iso standards 
there can be no assurance that we will be found in compliance with the quality system regulations by regulatory authorities  or that we will maintain compliance with en iso or iso standards in future audits 
our failure to comply with state or fda quality system regulations  maintain compliance with en iso or iso standards  or develop our manufacturing capability in compliance with such standards  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities and manufacturing processes have undergone a successful annual surveillance audit by the european notified body in november and a pre pma inspection in december in november and in january  the fda conducted an inspection of our quality system  which we successfully passed 
there is no assurance that our manufacturing facilities will continue to meet such compliance audits and will maintain such compliance standards 
if our sole source suppliers are unable to meet our demands  our business results will suffer 
we purchase certain key components for some of our products  from sole  single or limited source suppliers 
for some of these components  there are relatively few alternative sources of supply 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the numerous components used in our products  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs 
any supply interruption from vendors or failure to obtain alternative vendors for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products 
any such limitation on our ability to manufacture our products would cause our business results to suffer 
we may face product liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products 
we face an inherent business risk of product liability claims in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death 
we have received claims of this type in the past and may receive additional claims in the future 
we cannot be certain  in particular after commercial introduction of our products  that we will not experience losses due to product liability claims 
we currently have general liability insurance 
table of contents with coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a million annual limitation 
we have product liability insurance with coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a million annual limitation 
we cannot be certain that such coverage will be adequate or continue to be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that all of the activities encompassed within our business are or will be covered under our policies 
although we label our microcatheter products for single use only  we are aware that some physicians are re using such products 
moreover  despite labeling our microcatheters for diagnostic use only  we believe that physicians are using such mapping microcatheters for ablation 
multiple use or off label use of our microcatheters could subject us to increased exposure to product liability claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional product liability coverage if we significantly expand commercialization of our products 
such additional coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims or series of claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock may be delisted from nasdaq and may become subject to penny stock rules  which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares and may lead to financial penalties under certain of our agreements 
currently  our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our listing on nasdaq or any other established trading market 
among other things  nasdaq has considerable discretion with respect to listing standards  which include qualitative criteria as well as quantitative criteria  such as minimum stock price requirements  some of which are out of our control 
among other things  nasdaq listing rules provide that if the closing bid price of a company s stock is below for more than thirty consecutive trading days  the company faces possible delisting 
we have faced possible delisting from nasdaq in the past and may receive notices of potential delisting in the future 
for example  the nasd advised us that beginning on april   our common stock would no longer be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we appealed the nasd s decision  met the continued listing requirements and on june   the nasd notified us that our common stock would continue to trade on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  due to our stock trading below per share over various periods  we have received notices from the nasd that our stock could be delisted if its closing bid price did not equal or exceed per share for at least ten consecutive trading days before a date specified by the nasd 
for example  we received such a notice on october   but because the closing bid price of our common stock remained equal to or greater than per share for more than ten consecutive trading days as of january   we regained compliance with rule c  and that the matter was therefore closed 
subsequently  on july   we received another notification from the nasd that our common stock had closed below the minimum per share required for continued inclusion on the nasdaq for a period of more than thirty consecutive trading days 
in its notification  the nasd informed us that we had calendar days  or until january   to comply with nasd marketplace rule c 
in order to comply with this rule  the nasd indicated that the bid price of our common stock must close at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days at any time before january  on october   we were notified by the nasd that we regained compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  because the closing price of our common stock had been at per share or greater for at least ten consecutive trading days 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
delisting would have material and adverse effects on our business and the value of your investment 
if our common stock were to be delisted from nasdaq smallcap market  our common stock would be considered a penny stock under regulation of the securities and exchange commission and would therefore be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our securities 
in addition  the purchase agreements signed in connection with the december  and the january  closings of our private placement provide that if at any time during the two year period beginning on the respective closing dates of that placement our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national smallcap 
table of contents market for any reason  the investors shall receive an amount in cash equal to of the aggregate purchase price of all shares and warrants purchased under those agreements for each month or portion thereof from the date of such delisting until our common stock is again listed on the nasdaq national smallcap market 
we may incur other substantial liabilities under the terms of other financings  if our common stock is delisted 
we are dependent upon our key personnel and may need to hire additional key personnel in the future 
our ability to operate successfully depends in significant part upon the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
competition for such personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area 
we cannot be certain that we can retain such personnel or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel in the future  including key sales and marketing personnel 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our stock 
we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business 
substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
among other factors contributing to the potential volatility of our stock price  additional sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
delaware law  our corporate charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company 
these provisions include the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without stockholder approval  the ability of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to five million shares of preferred stock with rights set by the board of directors  which rights could be senior to those of our common stock  and the elimination of the rights of stockholders to act by written consent 
each of these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts 
in may  we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock on may  each right  when exercisable  entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock on the terms stated in our rights plan 
the rights will generally separate from the common stock and become exercisable if any person or group acquires or announces a tender offer to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock without the consent of our board of directors 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors 
in addition  we are governed by provisions of delaware law that may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and rights plan and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders would otherwise favor  or otherwise reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since we did not have short term investments or a line of credit obligation as of december   we do not have any material quantitative or qualitative disclosures about market risk
