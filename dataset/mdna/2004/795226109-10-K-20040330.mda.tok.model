per share dividend paid in and a 
per share dividend that was paid in critical accounting estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management selects and applies numerous accounting policies 
in applying these policies  management must make estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policy that is most susceptible to critical estimates and assumptions is the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of an appropriate provision is based on a determination of the probable amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio 
many factors influence the amount of future loan losses  relating to both the specific characteristics of the loan portfolio and general economic conditions nationally and locally 
while management carefully considers these factors in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary due to changed conditions  which could have an adverse impact on reported earnings in the future

net interest and dividend income the company earns income from two basic sources 
the primary source is through the management of its financial assets and liabilities and involves functioning as a financial intermediary 
the company accepts funds from depositors or borrows funds and either lends the funds to borrowers or invests those funds in various types of securities 
the second source is fee income  which is discussed in the noninterest income section of this analysis 
net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans  interest and dividends earned on securities the company s earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of advances from the federal home loan bank 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds

the increase is primarily due to additional advances taken from the federal home loan bank as part of a strategy to increase interest income 
securities portfolio the company manages the securities portfolio in accordance with the investment policy adopted by the board of directors 
the primary objectives are to earn interest and dividend income  provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs and to manage interest rate risk and asset quality diversifications to the company s assets 
the securities portfolio also acts as collateral for deposits of public agencies 
as of december   the securities portfolio  including federal home loan bank of boston stock  totaled  this represents an increase of  or over year end the increase is a reflection of the strategy to increase interest income as a portion of the advances from the federal home loan bank were used to purchase securities at a rate of return higher than the borrowing cost in order to generate additional interest income from the securities portfolio 
the make up of the securities portfolio is diversified among us government sponsored agencies  mortgage backed securities and securities issued by states of the united states and political subdivisions of the states 
securities are classified in the portfolio as either securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
the securities reported as available for sale are stated at fair value in the financial statements of the company 
unrealized holding gains and losses accumulated other comprehensive income loss are not included in earnings  but are reported as a net amount less expected tax in a separate component of capital until realized

federal funds sold the balance of federal funds sold totaled  at december  this compares to  at december  this represents a normal operating range of funds for daily cash needs and is considered to be adequate by management 
lending new business development during the year coupled with a small increase in loan demand resulted in an increase in loans receivable  net of allowance for loan losses of  or to  at december   as compared to  at december  competition for loans remains very aggressive in the market area of the company 
although the largest dollar volumes of loan activity continues to be in the residential mortgage area  the company offers a wide variety of loan types and terms along with competitive pricing to customers 
the company s credit function is designed to ensure adherence to prudent credit standards despite competition for loans in the company s market area 
provisions and allowance for loan losses total gross loans at december  were  as compared to  at december  this is an increase of  or 
at december  approximately of the bank s loan portfolio was related to real estate products and although the portfolio increased during the year  the concentration remained consistent as approximately of the portfolio was related to real estate at december  the increase in total gross loans was primarily the result of an increase in construction mortgages 
otherwise there were no material changes in the composition of the loan portfolio during this period 
credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans 
the bank monitors the quality of the portfolio to ensure that loan quality will not be sacrificed for growth or otherwise compromise the company s objectives 
because of the risk associated with extending loans the company maintains an allowance or reserve for credit losses through charges to earnings 
the loan loss provision for the year was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the level of nonperfoming loans remains low as a percentage of total loans 
nonperforming loans totaled  or 
of total loans at december  as compared to  or 
of total assets at december  nonperforming loans are closely monitored by management 
the bank evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a monthly basis 
no material changes have been made in the estimation methods or assumptions that the bank used in making this determination during the year ended december  such evaluations are based on assessments of credit quality and risk rating of loans by senior management  which is submitted to the board of directors for approval 
loans are initially risk rated when originated 
if there is deterioration in the credit  the risk rating is adjusted accordingly 
the allowance also includes a component resulting from the application of the measurement criteria of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
impaired loans receive individual evaluation of the allowance necessary on a monthly basis 
loans to be considered for impairment are defined in the bank s loan policy as residential real estate mortgages with balances of  or more and commercial loans of  or more 
such loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all principal and interest due according to the terms of the note 
any such commercial loans and residential mortgages will be considered impaired under any of the following circumstances non accrual status  loans over days delinquent  troubled debt restructures consummated after december   or loans classified as doubtful  meaning that they have weaknesses  which make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the individual allowance for any impaired loan is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
in addition  a risk of loss factor is applied in evaluating categories of loans generally as part of the periodic analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis reviews the allocations of the different categories of loans within the portfolio and considers historical loan losses and delinquency figures as well as any recent delinquency trends 
the credit card delinquency and loss history is separately evaluated and given a special loan loss factor because management recognizes the higher risk involved in such loans 
concentrations of credit and local economic factors are also evaluated on a periodic basis 
historical average net losses by loan type are examined as well as trends by type 
the bank s loan mix over the same period of time is also analyzed 
a loan loss allocation is made for each type of loan multiplied by the loan mix percentage for each loan type to produce a weighted average factor 
there have been no reallocations within the allowance during the years ended december  and at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled  representing of nonperforming loans  which totaled  and of total loans of  this compares to  representing of nonperforming loans  which totaled  and 
of total loans of  at december  a total of  in loans were charged off during the year  as compared to  during a total of  of previously charged off loans was recovered during the year ended december  recoveries for the year totaled  when comparing the two years  net charge offs were  for the year and during the year net charge offs totaled  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurances can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans or other factors 
additionally  despite the overall good quality of the loan portfolio generally  with expectations of the company to continue to grow its existing portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary to maintain adequate reserve coverage 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
deposits at year end totaled  compared to  at year end this increase of  or can be primarily attributed to the ongoing efforts of the company to competitively price products and develop and maintain relationship banking with its customers 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market rates  prevailing interest rates and the aggressive competition from nonbanking entities 
during the year  there was an increase in demand  now and savings accounts which are lower cost core deposits 
the average daily amount of deposits by category and the average rates paid on such deposits are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands year ended december average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate demand    now

these advances are made pursuant to various credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
at december   the company had  in outstanding advances from the federal home loan bank compared to  at december  management expects that it will continue this strategy of supplementing deposit growth with advances from federal home loan bank of boston 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
net interest income is sensitive to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets 
the bank s assets and liabilities are managed in accordance with policies established and reviewed by the bank s board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management committee monitors asset and deposit levels  developments and trends in interest rates  liquidity and capital 
one of the primary financial objectives is to manage interest rate risk and control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates in order to prudently improve net interest income and manage the maturities and interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities 
to quantify the extent of these risks both in its current position and in actions it might take in the future  interest rate risk is monitored using gap analysis which identifies the differences between assets and liabilities which mature or reprice during specific time frames and model simulation which is used to rate shock the company s assets and liability balances to measure how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from sudden rate changes 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the company was slightly asset sensitive positive gap 
this would suggest that the during a period of rising interest rates the company would be in a better position to invest in higher yielding assets resulting in growth in interest income 
to the contrary  during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in interest income 
the level of interest rate risk at december  is within the limits approved by the board of directors 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to raise funds on a timely basis at an acceptable cost in order to meet cash needs 
adequate liquidity is necessary to handle fluctuation in deposit levels  to provide for customers credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented 
the company manages liquidity primarily with readily marketable investment securities  deposits and loan repayments 
the company s subsidiary  salisbury bank and trust company is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston which provides a source of available borrowings for liquidity 
at december   the company had approximately  in loan commitments outstanding 
management believes that the current level of liquidity is ample to meet the company s needs for both the present and foreseeable future 
capital at december   the company had  in shareholder equity compared to  at december  this represents an increase of  or 
several components contributed to the change since december earnings for the year totaled  market conditions have reduced unrealized securities gains and resulted in a negative adjustment to comprehensive income of  the company declared dividends in resulting in a decrease in capital of  the company issued new shares of common stock under the terms of the director stock retainer plan during the second quarter of which resulted in an increase in capital of  under current regulatory definitions  the company and the bank are considered to be well capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as a result  the bank pays the lowest federal deposit insurance deposit premiums possible 
one primary measure of capital adequacy for regulatory purposes is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets 
this method of measuring capital adequacy helps to establish capital requirements that are sensitive to the differences in risk associated with various assets 
it takes in account off balance sheet exposure in assessing capital adequacy and it minimizes disincentives to holding liquid  low risk assets 
at year end  the company had a risk based capital ratio of compared to at december  the primary difference results from the negative effect of market movements on unrealized gains and therefore a decrease in comprehensive income 
maintaining strong capital is essential to bank safety and soundness 
however  the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth  meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices 
management believes that the capital ratios of the company and bank are adequate to continue to meet the foreseeable capital needs of the institution 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  over time  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary and as a result  interest rates tend to have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  inflation could impact earnings in future periods
