item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview during  the company completed its transformation to a pure life sciences company with the sale of the rutherford chemicals business unit during the fourth quarter 
consequently  the company began reporting three segments in human health  bioproducts  and biopharma 
the human health segment is primarily comprised of pharmaceutical ingredients derived from organic chemistry 
the bioproducts segment consists of cell culture products and services  endotoxin detection products and services  and electrophoresis and chromatography products 
the biopharma segment consists of the company s biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing business 
members of senior management team regularly review key financial metrics and the status of operating initiatives within our business 
these metrics include sales growth and gross margin performance by major product category  operating income margins  cash flows from operations  working capital levels  and return on capital employed at both a business unit and consolidated level in addition to earnings per share at a consolidated level 
we review this information on a monthly basis through extensive business unit reviews which include  among other operating issues  detailed discussions related to significant sales opportunities  proposed and ongoing investments in new businesses or property plant and equipment  cost reduction efforts  and the status of new product development 
in  the company continued to see strong growth across many product categories within its bioproducts segment  and management sees even more significant future growth potential in cell therapy services 
the bioproducts segment is primarily driven by biotechnology research spending levels  the overall demand for endotoxin detection products and services and the company s ability to continually provide product upgrades and innovative new products and services 
the loss of a large customer in whose product did not receive fda approval negatively affected our biopharma segment and the company continues to take aggressive steps to replace this business 
the company believes its biopharma business will experience more volatility than its other businesses due to the unpredictable nature of the biotechnology drug discovery and the availability of funding  but believes the overall growth trend predicted for the contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing market will result in significant long term growth for businesses providing these services 
in the human health segment  the company saw net sales growth driven by the impact of a weaker us dollar  with increases in sales of several active pharmaceutical ingredients offset by reductions in others  and pricing pressure within certain product categories 
this segment is driven primarily by patent expirations of branded drugs  population demographics  pressures to contain health care costs  and the level of outsourcing by branded pharmaceutical companies 
during  the company settled its mylan lawsuit and took a pre tax charge for approximately  as discussed more fully below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and recorded valuation allowances against net domestic deferred tax assets totaling  within the provision for income taxes for continuing operations  explained more fully below and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s tax rate may experience volatility until such time that domestic operations achieve sustainable profitability 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties dollars in thousands  except share data affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions 
service revenue the company s contract manufacturing business records revenue as services are performed 
in the company entered into a contract that contains milestone based payments 
revenue is recorded based on the cost of efforts since the contract s commencement up to the reporting date  divided by the total expected contractual costs from the contract s commencement to the end of the development arrangement  multiplied by the total expected contractual payments under the arrangement 
however  revenue would be limited to the amount of nonrefundable cash payments received and the subsequent milestone payments that have become due and payable at the reporting date 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments under fas  our review of our long lived assets  principally fixed assets  and other amortizable intangibles requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
our review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are done annually in accordance with sfas utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that represents fair value 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  as described in note to the accompanying financial statements  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  determined by third party and internal appraisals and valuations  as deemed appropriate  or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cash flows  discount rates and reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future sales and margin  operating  selling and administrative costs  interest and discount rates  technological changes  consumer demand and governmental regulations 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
environmental and litigation contingencies we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty dollars in thousands  except share data related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence reserves the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  this may result in an impairment of their ability to make payments to the company  and additional allowances may be required 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters that would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs deemed necessary by management 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and alternative minimum tax credits in the us  and net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income 
research and development r d including in process r d ipr d many of the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects that have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in asset valuations and review for potential impairments above 
acquired products or projects that have not achieved technical feasibility  ie  regulatory approval and no alternative future use are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
dollars in thousands  except share data employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries 
results of operations as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  on november   the sale of rutherford chemicals was completed and accordingly  the business comprising the rutherford chemicals segment is being reported as a discontinued operation in all periods presented 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of gross sales years ended december  gross sales net revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and special charges research and development expenses operating profit interest expense  net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss on discontinued operations net loss income the following tables show the gross sales of the company s three segments  in dollars and as a percentage of the company s total gross sales for the years ended december   and  as well as the gross profit by product segment for and years ended december  gross sales human health    bioproducts    biopharma    total gross sales    total net revenues    total gross profit    dollars in thousands  except share data years ended december  gross sales distribution human health bioproducts biopharma total gross sales distribution gross sales gross profit by product segment gross gross gross gross gross gross sales profit profit sales profit profit human health     bioproducts     biopharma     total     compared to cambrex corporation restated its results for the second quarter this restatement resulted from a reassessment of the carrying value of an equity investment in a privately held emerging biotechnology company 
the company concluded that million of the investment should have been impaired as of the second quarter and the remaining million should have been initially classified as an intangible asset related to a licensing agreement entered into concurrent with the equity investment 
the impairment charge of million was recorded in other expense and a related million tax benefit was recorded in provision for income taxes and as a deferred tax asset 
net income and total stockholders equity decreased by million 
this restatement did not have an effect on the company s cash flows 
gross sales for increased to  from  in sales in the human health and bioproducts segments increased compared to more than offsetting the decrease in the biopharma segments 
gross sales were favorably impacted due to the exchange rates reflecting the weakness in the us dollar primarily versus the euro and swedish krona 
the human health segment gross sales in of  were  or above human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
excluding the currency impact  the decrease results from the reduced pricing and market share of certain imaging products  lower shipments of a respiratory api due to reduced demand in the us  lower shipments of cardiovascular apis due primarily to the loss of a us customer and lower prices in europe 
partly offsetting these decreases were higher sales of central nervous system apis and a hypertension api due to increased demand  signing of a long term sales agreement for an api to treat alzheimer s disease and increased sales of crop protection and feed additive products due to high demand and successful implementation of higher capacity production lines 
the bioproducts segment gross sales in of  were  or above bioproducts sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
the increased sales before the impact of foreign currency are primarily due to higher cell therapy services due to increased demand and higher sales of normal human cells and media products due to increased demand  higher pricing and new product launches in europe 
these increases were partly offset by the impact of the sale of the in vitro diagnostic cell business during the first quarter of dollars in thousands  except share data the biopharma segment gross sales in of  were  or below the sales decrease primarily reflects the reduced volumes and suite utilization in our biopharmaceutical manufacturing business driven by the loss of a biopharmaceiutical customer whose product failed to receive fda approval  changes in terms of an existing contract and completion of other contracts that were only partially replaced 
foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
export sales from the company s domestic operations were  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in the  of sales in consisted of    and  of sales to north america  europe  asia and rest of world  respectively 
gross profit in was  compared to  in gross margin in decreased to from in  reflecting lower margins in all segments 
the biopharma segment gross margins were down significantly compared to the prior year due to lower suite utilization and lower pricing on an existing contract 
the human health segment margins decreased due to pricing pressures on api s and other fine custom chemicals including a volume based rebate adjustment and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partly offset by favorable product mix 
the bioproducts gross margins decreased primarily due to additional bad debt reserves in and certain favorable inventory adjustments which did not repeat in  partly offset by favorable production volumes  pricing  cost reduction activities and the favorable impact of foreign currency 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  or as a percentage of gross sales in increased from  or in sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange and an investment in the company s sales force 
higher administrative costs reflect the impact of currency translation due to the weaker us dollar  higher pension expenses  the costs incurred for the ongoing sec investigation into the restatement of results disclosed in the fourth quarter  the vesting of stock appreciation rights in the fourth quarter and regulatory compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in the increase primarily reflects investments in new product technologies for endotoxin detection and molecular biology and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
the results include a pre tax provision of  discounted to the present value of the five year pay out related to an agreement reached with mylan laboratories under which cambrex will contribute  to the settlement of consolidated litigation brought by a class of direct purchasers 
of this amount   has been paid to date with the balance due in equal installments over a five year period 
in exchange  cambrex received from mylan a release and full indemnity against future costs or liabilities in related litigation brought by the purchasers  as well as potential future claims related to this matter 
the results include a pre tax charge of  for asset impairment and other charges related to the closure of a small manufacturing facility and other severance charges 
the operating profit in was  compared to  in the results reflect lower gross margins in all segments  the  pre tax charge for the mylan settlement discussed above and higher operating expenses 
net interest expense of  in increased from reflecting higher average interest rates due primarily to the higher fixed interest rate on certain senior notes issued in  partly offset by the lower average debt due primarily to cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the rutherford chemicals business 
the average interest rate was for the year versus in the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective rate of as compared with in the same period of the combination of a loss due to the sale of rutherford chemicals  the mylan settlement  and a geographic shift of forecasted income resulted in  of domestic deferred tax assets being deemed unlikely to be realized  and as such  a valuation allowance for this amount was recorded against dollars in thousands  except share data these assets in the continuing operations tax provision 
the deferred tax assets deemed unlikely to be realized for financial reporting purposes include foreign tax credit carry forwards  carrying a five year life from inception  the tax benefit related to domestic net operating losses from continuing operations and research and experimentation tax credits that can be carried forward years  and a credit related to a federal alternative minimum tax that can be carried forward indefinitely 
the long carry forward period for domestic net operating losses and the alternative minimum credit and expected improvements in domestic continuing operations may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized  however  there is no assurance that such improvements can be achieved 
the income from continuing operations in was  or per diluted share versus  or per diluted share in the income from continuing operations includes a charge of approximately  for the deferred tax valuation allowance and a  pretax charge for the mylan settlement both discussed above 
the results include  consisting of an asset impairment and other charges related to the closure of a small manufacturing facility and other severance charges and a  pre tax charge for two investment impairments recorded in other expense 
in the third quarter  the company announced that an agreement to sell the rutherford chemicals business had been signed and on november  the transaction was completed 
as a result  this business is being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
the terms of sale resulted in a write down of assets to fair value of approximately  which is based on the selling price  including fees associated with the transaction  subject to working capital and other adjustments 
the company is currently in negotiations with the buyer regarding the working capital adjustment which is not expected to be finalized until first quarter in  loss on discontinued operations  net of tax was  compared to  in the results include the write down of assets discussed above 
the loss in includes pre tax charges of  for vitamin b litigation and  for asset impairment and other charges  pretax benefits of  due to a favorable insurance settlement and  for a favorable arbitration settlement 
in addition to the special items discussed above  the loss from discontinued operations increased due to unfavorable product mix and higher energy and raw material prices 
the net loss income in was  or per diluted share versus  or per diluted share in the same period a year ago 
the company s independent auditors informed the company that there were material weaknesses in the company s internal controls relating to the adequacy of documentation and level of personnel within the company s corporate tax department during the fourth quarter of the company has and is taking several actions to remediate these weaknesses 
please refer to item a for a more detailed description of this matter

 net income would have been  versus the  reported in gross sales in increased to  from  in sales in biopharma and bioproducts increased and  respectively compared to while the human health sales were relatively flat 
gross sales were favorably impacted due to the exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar primarily versus the euro and swedish krona 
the human health segment gross sales of  were or below human health sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
sales decreased due primarily to lower sales of cardiovascular apis due to customer inventory reductions and competitive pressures  lower sales of an antihistamine product due to fall off in customer demand and the effect of a dollars in thousands  except share data smaller shipment of an anti infective product for use in clinical trials 
also  feed additive sales were lower due to customer inventory management  and the impact of a customer bringing in house the manufacture of a performance enhancing polymer product  as well as customer inventory build ups of another performance enhancing polymer product 
partly offsetting these decreases were increased sales of a new amphetamine product used to treat attention deficit disorder  higher sales of gastrointestinal apis to meet increased demand  continued growth of a pharmaceutical intermediate used in therapeutic treatment of end state kidney disease  higher market share in imaging products worldwide  and higher sales of central nervous system api s due to increased worldwide demand 
the bioproducts segment gross sales of  were  or above bioproducts sales were favorably impacted due to exchange rates reflecting a weaker us dollar 
the increased sales were primarily due to higher sales of endotoxin protection products reflecting the impact of a more focused sales force and introduction of fda compliant software in mid  higher media and serum sales primarily liquid form due to market share gains in europe and strong shipments of normal human cells reflecting improved product supply and quality 
these increases were partly offset by the impact of the sale of the in vitro diagnostic cell business during the first quarter of the biopharma segment gross sales of  were  or above the increase in sales is due primarily to the acquisitions of the two contract biopharmaceutical process development and manufacturing businesses that make up this segment that were completed during the second half of foreign currency had no impact on biopharma sales 
export sales from the company s domestic operations were  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in the  of sales in consisted of    and  of sales to north america  europe  asia and rest of world  respectively 
gross profit in was  compared to  in gross margin in increased to from in the bioproducts segment margins increased due to favorable product mix and higher volumes 
this increase was partially offset by lower margins in the biopharma segment due to under absorption of fixed costs 
overall  human health segment margins were down slightly due to lower volumes partially offset by favorable product mix  which was aided by the company s hedging strategy and overall higher production at most european plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in versus for on an as adjusted basis considering the adoption of sfas no

 higher administrative costs were due primarily to the impact of the second half biopharmaceutical manufacturing acquisitions  a reduction of environmental accruals in the second quarter  and higher insurance premiums and employee benefit expenses in research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in  reflecting staff reductions and lower overall spending 
the results include a pre tax charge of  for asset impairment and other charges related to the closure of a small manufacturing facility and other severance expenses 
the results include a pre tax charge of  related to the closure of another small manufacturing facility 
the operating profit in was  compared to  in the results reflect the increased sales in the bioproduct and biopharma segments and the reduced amortization expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no

the loss in includes pre tax charge of  for restructuring and asset write downs and  pre tax charge for vitamin b litigation 
excluding the above items  loss on discontinued operations  net of tax  increased in primarily due to lower sales volume reflecting lower demand and timing of production campaigns for crop protection products  lower demand for certain performance enhancing chemicals  and continued weakness in the telecommunications and industrial coatings industries 
the company s net income in was  or per diluted share compared to  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december   down from  in the decrease in cash flow is due primarily to lower net income  net cash payments of  for settlement and legal costs associated with vitamin b litigation   cash payment associated with the mylan settlement  and insurance proceeds received in related to rutherford chemicals

in  part of the funds were used for suite expansion at our baltimore and hopkinton sites  endotoxin detection and cell therapy manufacturing capabilities at our walkersville site  r d lab upgrades at our milano site and new small scale production equipment for generic pharmaceuticals at our charles city site 
in november  the company entered into a  syndicated revolving credit agreement led by jpmorganchase as the administrative agent 
the agreement consisted of a day renewable senior revolving credit facility for  the day facility  and a year senior revolving credit facility of  the year agreement 
in  the company elected not to renew the day facility and this facility expired in november concurrently  the year agreement was amended with the addition of an accordion feature which  if utilized  will allow for the increase of the total commitments of up to  the year agreement allows the company to choose among various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by specific interest rates 
under the year agreement the interest rate options available to the company are the following us prime rate  libor plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to  or money market rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to dollars in thousands  except share data the applicable margin discussed above is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated modified ebitda 
the company also pays a facility fee between 
to 
on the entire credit facility 
the bank loan is collateralized by dividend and distribution rights associated with a pledge of a portion of stock that the company owns in a foreign holding company 
this foreign holding company owns certain of the company s non us operating subsidiaries 
as of december   there was  outstanding and  undrawn under the year agreement 
of the undrawn amount   is available to be borrowed as of december  due to limits established in the credit agreement 
the agreement is subject to financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  interest coverage ratio  leverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness 
the company complied with all covenants during in june  the company borrowed  in a private offering consisting of year guaranteed senior notes due in june with interest payments due semi annually at an annual rate of 
during october  the company borrowed an additional  in a private offering consisting of year guaranteed senior notes due in october with interest payments due semi annually at an annual rate of 
these notes rank equal with the company s other senior indebtedness and are collateralized by the same assets as the bank loan described above 
the funds were used primarily to pay down existing bank debt and to provide cambrex with longer term fixed rate debt 
the and average interest rates were and  respectively 
at december  our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows total long term debt  including capital leases       operating leases       purchase obligations     mylan settlement       contractual cash obligations       see notes and in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and other commitments 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our strong long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of net worth  an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratios 
the company met all bank covenants during and does not anticipate any covenant compliance issues in the coming year 
management also believes that the company will maintain its strong long term credit ratings 
any events that change the status of our ability to meet debt covenants or maintain our credit ratings could adversely impact our ability to fund operations 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors see risk factors section of this document for further explanation of factors that may negatively impact our cash flows 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
dollars in thousands  except share data financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy to lower its exposure to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro  swedish krona and british pound sterling currencies 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  was  the company estimates the forward contracts to be approximately of the non local currency exposure during the period 
unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
given a scenario that the operating companies non local currency collections match their forecasts  and all exchange rates move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on unhedged risk of  this residual risk allows for an over forecasting margin of error and prevents over hedging of actual operating risk 
as of december   the non local forecasted currency exposures were  offsetting this exposure is forecasted us dollar inter company payments from the combined european sites of  of the remaining  forecasted exposure   was partially hedged with major banks and through offsetting inter company hedge contracts  thereby reducing the non hedged risk to  interest rate management each of the interest rate options in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining rate market 
however  it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
for example  based on the company s current net debt outstanding  an unexpected annual interest rate increase of basis points could increase interest expense and thus decrease the company s after tax profitability by approximately to limit the risk of interest rates rising above a tolerable level  the company would pay a premium now in order to obtain a fixed interest rate at a predetermined cost in the future 
that swap stabilizes interest costs by converting floating or variable rates to fixed rates through a contract with a financial institution 
the company monitors the debt position and market trends to protect it from any unforeseen shifts in interest rates 
the company has employed a plan to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rates to fixed interest rates 
as of december   the company had eleven interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average fixed rate of  and with varying maturity dates through the year the company s strategy has been to cover a portion of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
at december   the coverage was approximately of our variable interest rate debt 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company is a party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the company had accruals  included in other non current liabilities of  and  at december  and december   respectively  for costs associated with the dollars in thousands  except share data study and remediation of superfund sites and the company s current and former operating sites for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
the increase in the accrual is due to currency fluctuation of  partially offset by in payments 
included in the liabilities mentioned above are environmental liabilities discussed in the sale of rutherford chemicals section below 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents management s best estimate of what it believes are the probable environmental cleanup related costs of a non capital nature 
after reviewing information currently available  management believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from the estimates could have a material adverse effect on financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
litigation mylan laboratories in late  the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl currently known as cambrex profarmaco milano srl  profarmaco were named as defendants along with mylan laboratories  inc mylan and gyma laboratories of america  inc  profarmaco s distributor in the united states in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc in the united states district court for the district of columbia the district court 
the allegations arise from exclusive license agreements between profarmaco and mylan covering the drug master files for lorazepam and clorazepate  two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis 
the ftc alleged violations of the federal trade commission act  including unlawful restraint of trade and conspiracy to monopolize markets for the apis 
a lawsuit making similar allegations against the same parties seeking injunctive relief and treble damages  was filed by the attorneys general of states in the district court on behalf of those states and persons in those states who were purchasers of the generic pharmaceuticals 
the same parties including the company and profarmaco have also been named in purported class action complaints brought by private plaintiffs in various state courts on behalf of purchasers of the apis in generic form  making allegations similar to those raised in the ftc s complaint and seeking various forms of relief including treble damages 
on february   a federal court in washington  dc entered an order and stipulated permanent injunction as part of a settlement of the ftc and attorneys general s suits 
under these settlement documents mylan agreed to pay over  on its own behalf and on behalf of most of the other defendant companies including cambrex and profarmaco 
in the order and injunction  the settling defendants also agreed to monitor certain future conduct 
mylan had been fully covering the costs for the defense and indemnity of cambrex and profarmaco under certain obligations set forth in the license agreements 
cambrex agreed to cover separate legal defense costs incurred for cambrex and profarmaco on a going forward basis beginning august  the private litigation continues 
on april   cambrex reached an agreement with mylan under which cambrex would contribute  to the settlement of consolidated litigation brought by a class of direct purchasers 
in exchange  cambrex and profarmaco received from mylan a release and full indemnity against future costs or liabilities in related litigation brought by purchasers  as well as potential future claims related to this matter 
approximately  was paid in april in accordance with the agreement  with the remaining  to be paid over the next five years 
cambrex recorded an  charge discounted to the present value due to the five year pay out in the first quarter of as a result of this settlement
