overview the company is one of the smallest publicly traded semiconductor makers 
following its formation  the company initially developed plug compatible second source products that were form  fit  and function compatible with products offered by other manufacturers 
beginning in  the company began identifying unique  proprietary products driven by its existing customer base 
while this transition to proprietary products required the company to obtain advanced design automation tools and to increase the number of people involved in product development  it enabled the company to focus its sales channels and limit the costs of those channels  and to compete in markets with pricing and delivery demands that are not as highly competitive as the markets for second source products 
the company primarily derives its revenues from the sale of semiconductor chips that perform high speed dsp in video image filtering and digital communications applications 
the company s transition to a proprietary product focus has had a significant impact on its financial results 
in  the company recorded significant write downs of inventory and long lived assets  as it recognized the obsolescence of its more mature  second source products 
the company anticipated increased revenues from the hdtv market starting in  but the delays in the broadcast industry s transition to high definition from analog signals resulted in less revenues from these products than the company anticipated 
in the meantime  revenues from the company s older second source products dropped dramatically as they were obsoleted 
therefore  while the company s revenues have decreased over the past few years  revenues from newer products have actually increased to partially take the place of revenues from mature  second source products 
in addition  the events of september  and the war on terrorism resulted in the company receiving approximately million in sales to a defense contractor for the cruise missile program during fiscal the company anticipated receiving additional revenues from the military programs during fiscal or  however  these revenues were relatively insignificant 
while the revenues from these programs may be significant in the future  the company cannot be sure if and when that will occur 
the company anticipates revenues from its newer proprietary products to increase if the hdtv market begins to ramp up 
in august  the fcc issued an order to television manufacturers that requires digital tuners to be incorporated into percent of the television sets with screens of or more inches starting in  into percent of the sets with screens of inches starting in  and into all sets with screens of inches or more by on october   the us court of appeals for the us circuit upheld the fcc mandate that  by  all but the very smallest television sets sold in the us must be equipped for receiving digital  along with traditional analog  television signals 
the court said the fcc s mandate was needed because the industry was not moving quickly enough to make new tuners available 
notwithstanding the impact of the delayed transition in the broadcasting industry and the overall downturn in the economy  the company has strengthened its balance sheet in the last few years 
as a result of the reorganization  aggressive expenditure controls  limitations on capital expenditures  reductions of inventory levels  and increased revenues from military programs  the company has increased its cash balance by  percent from fiscal to fiscal  while reducing its total liabilities by percent during the same period 
on december   the company elected to change its fiscal year to a fiscal year ending september previously  the company s fiscal years were comprised of weeks of seven days  each beginning on monday and ending on sunday  with fiscal ending september  and fiscal ending september  previously  the company s fiscal quarters were comprised of exactly weeks and  therefore  its fiscal years consisted of only days 
as a result of this change  the company s fiscal years will be comprised of days or  in leap years such as  days with each fiscal quarter ending at the end of a calendar quarter 
the company s fiscal year ended september  rather than september  the additional four days were included in the company s first quarter for fiscal  which ended december  results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was due to a continued down cycle of the semiconductor industry  the continued sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in the widespread adoption of hdtv broadcasting 
in addition  the company continues to experience a drop off in sales of its older products that is not countered enough by revenues from newer products 
while the company s net revenues decreased by percent  the company s cost of revenues  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased by percentage points 
this reduction in the cost of revenues is the result of the cost cutting of the past several years and a reduction in the amount of work in process inventory scrapped during fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company scrapped  of work in process inventory compared to  in fiscal in addition  the company increased its inventory reserve by approximately  in fiscal  while it decreased the reserve by in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  the company s gross profit increased by percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal while the company continues to believe new product development is key to future growth  revenue constraints forced the company to decrease research and development expenditures percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal however  as a percentage of net revenues  this decrease in expenditures still leaves the company over its target of percent 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenditures decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal in addition  the company believes its current team is made up of very qualified individuals that are capable of accelerating new product introductions in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenditures decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this reduction is a result of the cost cutting of the past several years  including but not limited to a reduction in staffing  a reduction of office space and rent  and reductions in directors and officers insurance levels 
while the company incurred a reduction of net revenues in fiscal  greater reductions of expenditures resulted in a percent decrease in the loss from operations  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to slightly decreased cash balances during the year  the company s interest income from deposits decreased percent in fiscal from  in fiscal to  as a result of the foregoing  the company s net loss for fiscal decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was due to the down cycle of the semiconductor industry  the sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in the adoption of hdtv broadcasting 
these factors limited the company s commercial product revenues to only a slight increase in fiscal compared to however  a sharp drop in sales of chips to military programs adversely impacted the company s overall revenues in fiscal during fiscal  approximately percent of revenues were derived from sales to defense contractors  while fiscal defense related sales were insignificant 
while the company s net revenues decreased percent  the company s cost of revenues also decreased by percent 
the company was able to reduce the cost of revenues at a rate proportional to the drop in revenues  in spite of having certain overhead expenses that are relatively fixed  due to cost cutting for the past several years 
in addition  during fiscal  the company obsoleted  and scrapped  of inventory  both of which are reflected in the cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal gross profit as a percent of revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal research and development expenditures increased less than one percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company believes that new product development is a key ingredient for future growth and elected to maintain research and development levels in spite of the drop in revenues 
as a result  research and development expenditures  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company was able to contain selling  general  and administrative expenditures as a result of on going cost control efforts 
as a result of the significant decrease in revenues and the sustained funding of research and development levels  the company had a net loss from operations of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss from operations of  in fiscal because the company had essentially no borrowing during fiscal  it had no interest expense  compared to  in fiscal due to the above factors  the company experienced a net loss of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company s operations produced  of net cash  despite its  net loss 
this was mainly from the net collection of accounts receivable of  reductions in inventories of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in accounts payable at year end 
even though the company maintains its prompt payments to vendors  the accounts payable balance increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the invoices of some vendors being received during the last week of the fiscal year and not yet being due as of the end of the fiscal year 
the company maintains its prompt payments terms with its vendors 
the company also received  of cash from the exercise of common stock options 
the company used this and the cash from operations to fund capital purchases of  and other asset purchases of  which resulted in the company s cash position decreasing by one percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal during fiscal  the company s operations produced  of net cash  despite its  net loss 
this was mainly the result of the net collection of accounts receivable of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses of  at the same time  the company maintained its prompt payment terms with vendors  so accounts payable decreased  the company used cash from operations to purchase capital assets aggregating  and to fund the repurchase of  of its common stock on the open market 
the company s cash position increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal during fiscal  the company produced net cash of  from operations  despite its  net loss 
while the company spent  for prepaid expenses   for accounts payable  and  for accrued expenses  it netted  from accounts receivable collections 
in addition  the company was able to produce  from its inventories as many of its fiscal revenues were shipped from existing stock 
the company used some of the cash from operations to fund capital expenditures of  and to repay capital lease obligations of  the company s cash position increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal the company s current working capital requirements are greatly reduced due to the cost cutting of the past few years 
the company believes that these cost cutting actions and its continued focus on higher margin products should result in after tax cash earnings being sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately  in cash reserves and its cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate  the company believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
working capital the company s investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
however  during the past few years  the company has been able to reduce its levels of inventories as it shifts from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products 
the company believes it will be able to streamline its inventories as it continues to shift to sole source proprietary products 
it also intends to continue its shortened accounts receivable collection cycle by re focusing on direct sales to customers rather than through distribution channels 
the company relies on third party suppliers for its raw materials  particularly its processed wafers  for which it currently relies primarily on one supplier  and as a result  maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
the company has periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as the company continues to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  it expects to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining its product offerings 
periodically  the company reviews inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
the company groups and evaluates its products based on their underlying die or wafer type the company s raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
management uses judgment in comparing the sales quantities for up to the prior fiscal months to the quantity on hand at the end of the fiscal year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the sales quantities  the company provides a reserve for the potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  the company compared the average sales price to the average unit cost of inventories at the end of the fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  the company provides a reserve 
during fiscal and  the company s locom and excess reserves totaled  and  respectively 
with the continuing slow economic conditions  the company felt it necessary to review its raw materials and work in process as well 
during fiscal  the company wrote off approximately  of work in process inventory and scrapped  which were directly expensed to the cost of revenues 
during fiscal  the company wrote off approximately million of work in process inventory and scrapped an additional  which were directly expensed to the cost of revenues 
the company believes its current reserve of  for inventory provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories at the end of fiscal although current levels of inventory impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility 
the company continues to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify its risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for the company s limited product development resources 
the company seeks to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance it will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  the company may consider identifying additional portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of the quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this results in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
financing while the company will continue to evaluate future debt and equity financing opportunities  it believes the cost reductions implemented in the past few years have resulted in the cash flow generated from operations providing an adequate base of liquidity to fund future operating and capital needs 
based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately  in cash reserves and its anticipated cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate  the company believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations 
payment timing may be subject to change

off balance sheet arrangements other than its operating leases  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and the results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and we are required to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
the summary of accounting policies included with the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company reevaluates its judgments  estimates  and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  and valuation of long lived assets 
the company bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and its beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are the critical accounting policies the company believes are affected by significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide the distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
revenues from such sales are recognized upon shipment  with a provision for estimated returns and allowances recorded at that time  if applicable 
while distributors are allowed to return items for stock rotation  they are required to place an order of equal or greater value at the same time 
therefore  no allowance for returns is recorded 
because the company does not change its pricing of products more than once a year  there has not been any pricing issues in the past several years  therefore  there is no allowance for price protection recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic conditions 
historically  the company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables 
inventories the company writes down its inventories for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves  and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when inventory for a product type exceeds months of demand for that product type 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
conversely  if demand comes back for product types that have been fully reserved  future margins may be higher 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets  are assessed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  or whenever management has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets 
such assets are carried at the lower of book value or fair value as estimated by management based on appraisals  current market value  and comparable sales value  as appropriate 
assets to be held and used affected by such impairment loss are depreciated or amortized at their new carrying amounts over the remaining estimated life  assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are not subject to further depreciation or amortization 
in determining whether an impairment exists  the company uses undiscounted future cash flows without interest charges compared to the carrying value of the assets 
impact of new financial accounting standards there were no new financial accounting pronouncements with a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all of its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
of course  demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors 
the company also does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that are not considered cash under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
