our actual results and performance may differ materially from the results and performance anticipated by any forward looking statements due to these risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed below in this item under the heading risk factors 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
overview we are a california corporation and were incorporated in august our principal product is the versant developer suite  or vds  a sixth generation object database management system 
our other products include versant enjin  a database management product suite that accelerates transactions for application servers  versant real time framework  or vrtf  a comprehensive framework for delivering real time solutions and versant jdo  a data access tool that enables enterprise applications to efficiently access data from a versant object database 
we commenced commercial shipment of vds in and commercially released versant enjin in we license vds  versant enjin and peripheral products  and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
following our acquisition of mokume software in november of  we commenced our real time solutions business and in january announced our vrtf real time solutions product 
we introduced versant jdo in the fourth quarter of in addition to these products  we also offer other internally developed peripheral software products and resell related software developed by third parties 
we also provide maintenance and support services related to our products as well as consulting and training services 
these services are an important aspect of our business  and in the fiscal year ended october   a majority of our revenues were derived from these services 
to date  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the following data management products and services sales of licenses for vds and  to a lesser extent  versant enjin  vrtf and versant jdo  maintenance and support services related to vds  versant enjin  and vrtf  consulting services versant consulting practice and dedicated ibm websphere consulting practice and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with vds and versant enjin  sales of peripheral products for vds and versant enjin  the resale of licenses  maintenance  training and consulting for third party products that complement vds and versant enjin  and reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred for revenue in the income statement 
in fiscal we continued to focus our efforts on i sales and product development activities designed to obtain revenue growth from  and enhance our data management products  vds and versant enjin  ii further work to pursue and develop our real time solutions business initiative and related products  such as vrtf  and iii obtaining growth in our consulting service programs 
we expect that our principal sources of revenue for the foreseeable future will be licenses of vds  versant enjin  related products and vrtf  as well as maintenance  support  training and consulting services 
to a lesser degree we also anticipate deriving revenue from new products we may develop in our real time business and the resale of third party products 
while it will continue to be important for versant to derive revenue from customers it has historically served in the telecommunications  financial services  technology and defense industries  we believe that our efforts in the real time market and  to a lesser degree  in the e business market  will be important elements of our future performance 
success in the market for real time products will depend on both the successful growth and emergence of this market and its continued need for highly scalable  high performance and reliable object based technologies such as ours 
if our proposed merger with poet holdings is approved by our shareholders and poet s stockholders and is consummated  we currently expect that our data management software business will market products to new and additional market segments now addressed by poet that we do not currently pursue and that our business would focus even moreso on international  primarily european  sales 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends and industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations  and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that our estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding future uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  the determination of our reserve for doubtful accounts and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue consists mainly of revenue earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements and agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we defer revenue from license arrangements that require significant modification of the software and or non recurring engineering agreements requiring future obligations not yet performed and record it as revenue using contract accounting 
revenue from software license arrangements  including prepayment revenue  is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the contingency  customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  as applicable 
we license our data management products to end users  value added resellers and distributors through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop an application program that uses vds or versant enjin 
before that customer may deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our database management system 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
pricing of vds and versant enjin varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application will run and the number of users that will be able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
versant does not currently license our vrtf product directly to end users 
to date  it has been marketed only as a private labeled product sold through physical execution systems vendors to whom versant will provide integration  training and other consulting services 
resellers  including value added resellers and distributors  purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis  on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
resellers are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of vds  versant enjin and vrtf that are either bundled or embedded in the resellers applications and sold directly to end users 
resellers are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is based either on the number of copies of application software distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the reseller to its end user customers 
revenue from royalties is recognized when reported by the reseller  assuming collection is probable 
revenue from our resale of third party products is recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions and we assume the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenue from our resale of third party products or services is recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
probability of collection is assessed using the following customer information credit service reports  bank and trade references  public filings  and or current financial statements 
prior payment experience is reviewed on all existing customers 
payment terms in excess of our standard payment terms of days net  are granted on an exception basis  typically in situations where customers elect to purchase development and deployment licenses simultaneously for an entire project and are attempting to align their payments with deployment schedules 
extended payment terms are generally granted only to customers with a proven ability to pay at the time the order is received  and with prior approval of our senior management 
we defer revenue from maintenance and support arrangements and recognize it ratably over the term of the arrangement  which is typically twelve months 
training and consulting revenue is recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs ipr d  if any  are charged to operations at the acquisition date 
mokume software  which we acquired in november of  did not have significant tangible assets at the date of acquisition and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price has been allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d for future acquisitions  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results and requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail than we initially assumed  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  prior to november   versant amortized goodwill over five years using the straight line method 
identifiable intangibles acquired technology are currently amortized over five years using the straight line method 
as described below  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  versant tests goodwill for impairment periodically and records any necessary impairment in accordance with sfas impairment of long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as provided in sfas goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process 
first  we must determine if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to our carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of our assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
reserve for doubtful accounts we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other factors i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable ie license  consulting  maintenance  etc  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of each customer  vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and vii general economic conditions 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and interpretations thereof collectively apb rather than the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
we record and measure deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally up to four years 
results of operations in  we filed a report on form k reporting the decision by our board of directors to change our fiscal year end from december to october this change was made to better align our sales and financial reporting cycle with our customers procurement cycles
