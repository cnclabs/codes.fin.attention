words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  and intends  and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements concern matters which include  but are not limited to  the revenue model and market for the ssp product line  the features  benefits and advantages of the ssp platform  international operations and sales  gross margins  spending levels  the availability of licenses to third party proprietary rights  business and sales strategies  matters relating to proprietary rights  competition  exchange rate fluctuations and our liquidity and capital needs 
these and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward looking statements 
these matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in addition to the factors discussed above  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the demand for the ssp platform  the performance and functionality of ssp technology  our ability to deliver products on time  and market acceptance of new products or upgrades of existing products  the timing of  or delay in  large customer orders  continued availability of technology and intellectual property license rights  product life cycles  quality control of products sold  competitive conditions in the industry  economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  and the risks listed from time to time in the reports that we file with the us securities and exchange commission 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include without limitation those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward looking statements 
we continue to face significant risks associated with the successful execution of our business strategy 
these significant risks include  but are not limited to continued technology and product development  introduction and market acceptance of new products  changes in the marketplace  liquidity  competition from existing and new competitors that may enter the marketplace  impairment of prepaid royalties and retention of key personnel 
in addition  we also face significant risks associated with the development and future deployment of our ssp products and the successful execution of the related business strategy 
during  we began development of a range of ssp products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and are designed to allow wireless carriers to execute over the air repair services and build valuable incremental services 
with the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  the ssp product is our sole product line 
the ssp product began shipping in the last quarter of  and we have achieved only minimal sales to date 
we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
additionally  the sales cycle for the ssp products is expected to take longer than the six to nine months sales cycle of the jeode product 
we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since the second quarter of to achieve profitability  we will have to increase our revenue significantly 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon the success of our ssp product line 
if we are unable to generate revenues from ssp in the form of development license fees  maintenance and support fees  commercial use royalties and nonrecurring engineering activities  our current revenue levels will be insufficient to sustain our business 
we have undertaken measures to reduce operating expenses and redesign our commercial efforts to adapt to new developments 
based upon our current forecasts and estimates  our current cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from on going operations and other liquid sources of cash including the cash from the sale of the jeode product line available to us  we believe that insignia will have sufficient funds to meet its operating and capital requirements through the end of fiscal year to the extent that we require additional financing  there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such funding when it is needed on acceptable terms  or at all 
the failure to raise such additional funds on a timely basis and on sufficiently favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our liquidity also may be adversely affected in the future by factors such as higher interest rates  inability to borrow without collateral  limited availability of capital financing and continued operating losses 
overview we commenced operations in  and currently develop  market and support software technologies that enable mobile operators and phone manufacturers to update the firmware of mobile devices using standard over the air data networks 
before  our principal product line was the jeode platform  based on our embedded virtual machine evm technology 
the jeode platform was our implementation of sun microsystems  inc s sun java technology tailored for smart devices 
the product became available for sale in march and had been our principal product line since the third quarter of the jeode product line was sold in april during  we began development of a range of products secure system provisioning or ssp products for the mobile phone and wireless operator industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless operators and phone manufacturers to reduce customer care and software recall costs as well as increase subscriber revenue by deploying new mobile services based on dynamically provisional capabilities 
with the sale of our jvm product line in april  our sole product line consists of our ssp product 
we shipped our first ssp product in december our operations outside of the united states are primarily in the united kingdom  where part of our research and development operations and our european sales activities are located 
we sell our ssp platform directly to customers or through our hosted partners such as metrowerks and accord customer care solutions 
our revenues from customers outside the united states are derived primarily from europe and asia and are generally affected by the same factors as our revenues from customers in the united states 
the operating expenses of our operations outside the united states are mostly incurred in europe and relate to our research and development and european sales activities 
such expenses consist primarily of ongoing fixed costs and consequently do not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenues 
our revenues and expenses outside the united states can fluctuate from period to period based on movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our revenues 
we operate with the us dollar as our functional currency  with a majority of revenues and operating expenses denominated in us dollars 
pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar can cause uk expenses  which are translated into dollars for financial statement reporting purposes  to vary from period to period 
the current economic environment the economic climate in which we operate has been difficult over the last three years  and information technology it spending has decreased dramatically 
this has had an effect on our ability to generate new license fees  as it budgets have been reduced or frozen and expenditures like those required to purchase some of our products have been quite limited 
we cannot provide any assurance that these pressures on it spending will ease  or that the general economic climate will improve 
continued competitive pressure and a weak economy could have a continuing pronounced effect on our operating results 
we have undertaken a variety of cost reduction measures designed to bring our operating expenses in line with our perceptions of the business climate including workforce reductions 
significant financial events in during  we sold the jeode product line for million  established an exclusive master distribution agreement for the jeode technology in exchange for million in minimum guaranteed royalties and completed a securities subscription agreement which generated net proceeds of million  and various warrant conversions generated net proceeds of critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of prepaid royalties  and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue on the earlier of due date or cash collected 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we will defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order primarily for maintenance renewals as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we will allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we will defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligation is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us for these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we will generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we will assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
prepaid royalties our agreements with licensors sometimes require us to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are capitalized and amortized as cost of sales based on the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales 
we continually evaluate recoverability of prepaid royalties and  if necessary  will charge to cost of sales any amount that we deem unlikely to be recoverable in the future 
the prepaid royalties carried on the balance sheet  under the terms of the distribution agreement between sun and insignia  require us to use these prepaid licenses before june  we have performed an assessment of whether there was an indication that prepaid royalties of million are impaired as of december  with the completion of the sale of the jvm product line to esmertec  esmertec entered into a master distributor license agreement with insignia  whereby esmertec will license product from insignia which will consume all the prepaids paid to sun 
prepaid royalties are classified as current assets based on estimated net product sales within the next year 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and will adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivables and future operating results 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
sale of java virtual machine assets on february   we entered into a million loan agreement with esmertec 
the loan was made in two installments of  each on february  and february  the rate of interest on each loan is at prime plus two percent 
accrued interest was due on the last day of each month 
the principal and any outstanding accrued interest was due on or before february  at december   the principal amount outstanding on this loan was million 
the principal was paid on january  on march   we entered into several other agreements the agreements with esmertec including a definitive agreement to sell certain assets relating to our java virtual machine jvm product line in exchange for million payable in installments 
payments under the agreement would be  on april    on july    on october    on january  and  on april  the net assets amounting to approximately  primarily included the fixed assets  certain liabilities customer agreements and employees related to the jvm product line 
costs incurred relating to this transaction were approximately  we have recorded a gain on the sale of the assets of approximately  in other income on the statement of operations 
the transaction closed on april  under the terms of the agreements  esmertec became the exclusive master distributor of the jvm technology in exchange for million in minimum guaranteed royalties through june   at which time  the jvm technology rights will transfer to esmertec 
minimum payments under the license are as follows due date payment april   may   july   july   august   october   october   november   january   january   february   april   may   july   august   october   total  as of december   the minimum payments due under this agreement have been paid in a timely manner 
in addition  we can earn up to an additional million over the three year period ended april based on a percentage of esmertec s sales of the jvm product 
additionally  the parties have entered into a cooperative agreement to promote insignia s ssp software product to esmertec s mobile platform customers 
the agreements provide for esmertec to manage the existing insignia jvm customer relationships and license the insignia and esmertec technologies to sell to the then combined customer base and business partners 
under the agreements  esmertec will assume the entire jvm product line through a final asset purchase in june as part of the sale of our jvm product line  we transferred employees to esmertec  of which were development engineers 
in addition  as part of the sale  esmertec entered into an agreement with our uk building landlord to assume the lease on one of the two buildings leased by insignia 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data for the three years ended december  expressed as a percentage of total revenues comparisons of years ended december    and revenues change to change to in thousands license revenues   service revenues   total revenues   the jeode product line was our primary business for  and revenue from the jeode product line was derived from four main sources the sale of a development license  the sale of annual maintenance and support contract services  prepaid royalties and commercial use royalties based on shipments of products that include jeode technology  and non recurring engineering activities 
revenues from the sale of development licenses  packaged products and royalties received from oems are classified as license revenue  while revenues from non recurring engineering activities  training  and annual maintenance contracts are classified as service revenue 
in  and  jeode platform revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
the jeode platform became available for sale in the jeode platform had been our principal product until it was sold in march  resulting in significant decreased revenues in and a decrease from the jeode platform revenue decreased in compared to due to increased competition as well as the general weakening of the economy 
in  and  license revenue from the sale of jeode accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
service revenue from the jeode platform accounted for  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
with the sale of the jvm product line to esmertec  we expect minimal revenue from the jvm license and service revenue 
in  the ssp product shipped in december and accounted for of total revenues 
license revenues decreased in compared to due to the sale of the jeode product line 
license revenues decreased in compared to due to the decline in the internet appliance market and the general weakening of the economy 
service revenues decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the jeode product line 
service revenues decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased jeode engineering and jeode support contracts 
in  and  total revenues from the company s softwindows product line accounted for  and  respectively  of total insignia revenues primarily due to reduced demand for softwindows and management s decision to discontinue the product line in no future revenues are expected from softwindows 
sales to distributors and oem s representing more than of total revenue in each period accounted for the following percentages of total revenue distributors phoenix technologies ltd 
all distributors oem s hewlett packard company all oems less than sales to customers outside the united states  derived mainly from customers in europe and asia  represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we currently market ssp to customers in the united states  europe and japan 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on total revenues in  or economic conditions in europe and japan  as well as fluctuations in the value of the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar and british pound sterling  could impair our revenue and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other special risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
cost of revenues and gross margin change to change to in thousands cost of license revenues   gross margin license revenues cost of service revenues gross margin service revenues total cost of revenues gross margin total revenues cost of license revenue is mainly comprised of royalties to third parties 
cost of service revenue includes costs associated with non recurring engineering activities and end user support under maintenance contracts 
we believe that the significant factors affecting the jeode platform gross margin include pricing of the technology license  pricing of the unit usage and royalties to third parties such as sun microsystems  inc sun 
in early  we signed a five year agreement with sun under which sun established us as an authorized virtual machine provider 
under this agreement we are required to pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode platform enabled smart device shipped by our customers  plus a royalty on all development licenses put in place between our customers and us 
in the third quarter of  we amended our license agreement with sun 
the amendment expanded the scope of the licensed technology  changed the royalty rate  limited the royalty obligations to only per units licensed  established required prepaid royalties and extended the expiration date of the contract from march to june license revenue gross margins in were compared to in the decrease was due to lower margins on revenue 
license revenue gross margins in were compared to in the increase was due to revenue including a large transaction with lower gross margin and including greater license revenue with reduced cost of sales 
gross margin for service revenue is impacted by the level of and pricing terms of non recurring engineering activities  which can vary from customer to customer  from contract to contract and based on the level of maintenance contracts sold 
service revenue gross margins in were compared to in the increase was primarily a result of the transfer of customers with the sale of the jeode product line 
gross margin for service revenue in was compared to in the decrease was due to fewer maintenance contracts and relatively fixed costs of service and personnel resources 
operating expenses change to change to in thousands sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues research and development percentage of total revenues general and administrative percentage of total revenues restructuring percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs  salesperson commissions  advertising and promotional expenses and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by in compared to primarily due to decreased personnel costs  decreased recruiting costs and decreased employee travel 
costs for sales and marketing personnel decreased by million due to a decrease in headcount in the decreased headcount resulted in a decrease in sales and marketing travel of  and a  decrease in facility and telephone costs as well as a  decrease in recruiting costs 
allocated overhead costs also decreased by  due to the resulting headcount decrease 
in addition  marketing programs and public relations costs decreased by  as a result of other cost cutting measures 
these costs decreases were offset by a  increase in costs for the french sales office and a  increase in costs to an outside sales firm targeting the asian markets 
both the increase in the french office and costs for the outside sales firm are a result of increased sales efforts for the ssp product 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by in from this decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel costs  decreased recruiting costs and decreased employee travel 
personnel costs decreased due to a decrease in headcount throughout most of the year 
decreased headcount resulted in a decrease in related travel expenditures and a decrease in recruiting fees over the prior year 
legal fees relating to patent and trademarks decreased approximately over the prior year 
we anticipate a moderate increase in sales and marketing expenses in the next year as we continue to control expenses in our marketing and sales organization 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  overhead costs relating to occupancy  software support and maintenance and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses in decreased from a decrease of million was due to a reduction in personnel related costs resulting from the transferring of employees with the sale of the jeode product line and a  decrease from not renewing our java support and maintenance contract 
recruiting costs and professional consulting costs decreased by  and  respectively 
in addition  overhead costs for management information systems and facilities decreased by  these decreases were offset by  less costs being allocated from the engineering department to costs of sales due to decreased engineering consulting services and technical support services performed in research and development expenses in decreased from approximately  of the decrease was due to reductions in personnel related expenses 
there was a slight increase of  relating to an increased reliance on outside consultants 
in addition there was an increase of  for support and maintenance expenditures relating to a software vendor 
research and development expenses are expected to increase moderately in the next year 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established  after which any additional costs are capitalized 
in  and  no development expenditures were capitalized  as there were no amounts that qualified for capitalization 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for finance  information systems  human resources and general management 
general and administrative expenses decreased by in from the decrease was a result of a  decrease in compensation expenses due to headcount reductions and a  decrease in facility costs 
dilapidation costs decreased in by  due to costs incurred to restore united kingdom facilities to their original condition in travel costs decreased by  due to decreased headcount and cost cutting measures  and insurance costs decreased by  these decreases were offset by  which was a result of fewer overhead costs being allocated out to other departments in general and administrative expenses decreased by in from primarily as a result of decreased personnel costs  facility costs and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase moderately in the next year 
restructuring in the third quarter of  we completed a worldwide reduction of headcount of approximately of our staff 
restructuring expenses consist of severance payments made during the third and fourth quarters of in october  we reduced headcount by employees 
restructuring expenses which represented and of total revenues in and  respectively  consisted of costs related to terminated employees  including severance payments as well as national insurance costs where legally required 
on february   we announced a restructuring of the organization to focus on the ssp technology 
the restructuring charges for the quarters ended march  june  september and december  were    and  respectively  for employee termination benefits

the balance of  was due to realized foreign exchange gains 
net other income decreased from income of  in to expense of  in the decrease was due mainly to an expense of  relating to the black scholes valuation of a warrant for the purchase of million shares issued to fusion capital see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income of  was due to a combination of foreign exchange gains and losses 
net other income is expected to decrease in and will primarily comprise of exchange gains and losses 
approximately of our total revenues and over of our operating expenses are denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
most of our remaining revenues and expenses are british pound sterling denominated and  consequently  we are exposed to fluctuations in british pound sterling exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material effect on our results of operations in the future 
we did not enter into any currency option hedge contracts in  or we have  at times  an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities

the benefit from income taxes for primarily represented the release of a provision for prior year taxes that was no longer required following an agreement in principle with the united kingdom tax authorities  which was offset by japanese income tax withholding 
a more complete analysis of the differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective income tax rate is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets  primarily comprised of net operating losses  on the basis that significant uncertainty exists with respect to their realization 
effective and retroactive to  research and development expenditures incurred in the united kingdom qualified for a tax credit 
the tax credit does not offset tax liability but rather is a refund

during the year ended december   our net accounts receivable decreased  from  at december  to  at december  due to reduced revenue 
capital additions totaled   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures or strategic investment 
we expect that the decrease in accounts receivable  decreased revenues in the quarter ended december  and other factors will substantially decrease our future cash flows for the next several quarters 
as of december   we had the following contractual cash obligations including operating lease obligations that were restructured pursuant to the sale of the jeode product line in thousands operating leases debt total year ending december  thereafter excludes interest as of december   one customer accounted for of the gross accounts receivable balance 
in june  insignia and sun microsystems  inc sun entered into an addendum the addendum to the distribution agreement relating to distribution of products to an insignia customer 
in september  the two companies entered into amendment no 
the amendment to the technology license and distribution agreement the distribution agreement 
the amendment and the addendum each required us to make non refundable royalty prepayments to sun 
a total of million prepaid royalties were paid to sun under distribution agreements through the second quarter of there are no additional required royalty prepayments due to sun under these distribution agreements 
the prepaid royalties carried on the balance sheet  under the terms of the agreement between sun and insignia  require us to use these prepaid licenses before june  with the sale of the jvm product line to esmertec  esmertec has entered into a master distributor license agreement with insignia  whereby esmertec will license product from insignia which will consume all the prepaids to sun 
on march   our us subsidiary  insignia solutions  inc insignia us entered into an accounts receivable financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
the financing agreement allowed insignia us to borrow an amount up to of eligible receivables not to exceed  with interest at the bank s prime rate plus two percentage points 
the agreement was canceled on february   and the ucc filing liens on the assets of insignia us were terminated 
no funds were ever borrowed under this credit facility 
we have granted extended payment terms from time to time depending on various factors  including the length of the extended payment period and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we report these future payments as accounts receivable and either recognized revenue or deferred revenue 
deferred revenue increased by  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million received from the master distribution agreement relating to the sun royalties and  from the guaranteed revenue share 
offsetting these increases were deductions for reported usage 
insignia  as permitted under delaware law and in accordance with our bylaws  indemnifies our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while the officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we do have a director and officer insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage  we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
in our sales agreements  we typically agree to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liability resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
the terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
to date we have not paid any amounts to settle claims or defend lawsuits 
insignia  on a limited basis  has granted price protection 
the terms of these agreements are generally perpetual 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these potential future payments either because they are not probable or we have yet to incur the expense 
insignia warrants its software products against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety days 
there is no warranty accrual recorded because potential future payments either are not probable or we have yet to incur the expense 
on october   we entered into a securities subscription agreement agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  pursuant to which fusion capital agreed to purchase  on each trading day following the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the american depository shares adss to be purchased by fusion capital   of our adss up to an aggregate of million over a period of months 
the purchase price of the adss will be equal to a price based upon the future market price of the shares without any fixed discount to the market price 
in order to be in compliance with nasdaq rules  we could not sell our ordinary shares to fusion capital at a price below  which represents the greater of the book value per share of our ordinary shares as of september  or the closing sale price per share of our adss on october  if we elect to sell our shares to fusion capital at a price per share below  we first would be required to obtain shareholder approval in order to be in compliance with applicable nasdaq rules 
under the laws of england and wales  we are not permitted to sell our adss at a purchase price that is less than the nominal value of our ordinary shares 
currently  the nominal value per ordinary share is

however  due to beneficial ownership restrictions   shares were issued and the balance was held as common stock subscription until january for the twelve months ended december   we issued and sold to fusion  adss resulting in net proceeds of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we issued to fusion capital one redeemable warrant for adss representing  ordinary shares  and one non redeemable warrant for adss representing  ordinary shares 
the redeemable warrant was redeemable by insignia at any time on or before june  for an aggregate redemption price of  insignia did not redeem the warrant  and the redemption period has lapsed 
the exercise price per ordinary share of each warrant is the us dollar equivalent of pence 
each warrant expires on september  and is partially exercisable 
as of december   the estimated value of the warrants  using the black scholes model  was  unless an event of default occurs under the agreement  the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants must be held by fusion capital until the earlier of i months from the date of the agreement or ii the date the agreement is terminated 
fusion exercised both the redeemable and non redeemable warrants in the quarter ended september  we issued  adss for a total of  net of issuance costs 
the agreement and the forms of the registration rights agreement  the redeemable warrant and the non redeemable warrant between insignia and fusion capital are filed as exhibits to the k dated october  based upon our current forecasts and estimates  our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from on going operations and other liquid sources of cash including the securities subscription and cash generated from the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  we believe that insignia will have sufficient funds to meet its operating and capital requirements through the end of the fiscal year 
if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing including selling additional equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned sales  marketing and product development efforts  which could jeopardize our business 
private placements and warrants in a private placement that closed on february   certain investors purchased from us a total of  units at a price of per unit 
each unit comprises one ads and one half of one warrant to purchase one ads 
as described below  we may cancel the warrants upon sixty days prior written notice if the closing sale price of our adss exceeds for consecutive trading days following the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the sec for the adss issued and the adss underlying the warrants 
as compensation for services in connection with the private placement  we i issued five year warrants to purchase  of our adss at an exercise price of per share  and ii paid a cash compensation equal to of the first million and on the remainder of the gross proceeds received by us in the private placement to the placement agent 
the investors that participated in this private placement received warrants to purchase one ads for every two adss they purchased 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at an exercise price per ads equal to the lower of and the average quoted closing sale price of our adss for the ten trading days ending on the day preceding the day we are informed of the investor s intent to exercise  less a discount 
these warrants expire on february  all of these warrants were exercised in january on october   we entered into a securities subscription agreement with fusion capital  which is described above and in risk factors we may need additional financing to sustain our operations 
on february  we entered into agreements whereby we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of to a total of investors  including wind river systems  inc  and a member of our board of directors 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the investors  at an exercise price of the lower of the average quoted closing sale price of our ads s for the ten trading days ending on the day preceding the date of the warrant holder s intent to exercise less a discount  and 
the warrants are exercisable and expire on february  all of these warrants were exercised in january we received million less offering expenses totaling million 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the placement agent exercisable at a price of 
these warrants are exercisable and expire on february  the securities were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided under regulation d promulgated under the securities act 
in april  three investors exercised their warrants for  adss 
we received  net of  for legal fees for the warrant exercises 
in march  three investors exercised their warrants for  adss 
we received  net of  for legal fees for the warrant exercises 
in august  warrants issued in the private placement were modified to reduce their exercise price to per share 
the modification was accounted for in accordance with sfas and resulted in a charge of approximately  to earnings and an increase in the value of the mandatorily redeemable warrants 
in september and november  warrants to purchase  and  ordinary shares were exercised for net proceeds of approximately  and  respectively 
in connection with the exercise of the warrants   was reclassified from mandatorily redeemable warrants to additional paid in capital 
fusion exercised warrants to purchase  ordinary shares in september resulting in net proceeds of approximately  at december   warrants to purchase  ordinary shares are outstanding and exercisable  of which  were exercised in january in september   ordinary shares in ads form were purchased under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement resulting in proceeds of  less offering expenses of  in november  fusion capital purchased  ordinary shares in ads form 
we received million less offering expenses totaling  in accordance with the subscription agreement  fusion capital may not beneficially own more than of the total ordinary shares 
as a result  fusion capital requested that we only issue  shares and issue the balance at a later date 
this resulted in  recorded as stock subscription in the equity section of the balance sheet as of december  the balance of shares were issued in january in november  we issued a warrant to purchase up to  adss to a strategic partner 
the warrant becomes exercisable upon achievement of certain milestones and terminates on the third anniversary of the final milestone 
the exercise price is per share with respect to the first milestone  and the average of and the then current market price with respect to the other milestones 
at december   none of the warrants had vested 
the warrant will be valued as it vests and future charges will be recorded based on the amount of the warrant that vests using the black scholes pricing model 
on january   we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of to a total of investors 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the investors at an exercise price of 
the warrants are exercisable immediately and expire january  we received million less offering expenses totaling  in this transaction 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the placement agent exercisable at a price of per share 
these warrants are exercisable immediately and expire january  dilution adjustments in december  we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of per share through a private placement 
we received million less offering expenses totaling million 
along with adss  we also issued to the investors warrants that entitle them to purchase a total of  adss at an exercise price of per ads 
the warrants outstanding at december  totaled  under the december private placement  the investors received warrants to purchase three adss for every adss they purchased 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at of the original per ads purchase price  or 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss which may be issued if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants  which ends on december  the private placement that closed on november  was a sale which triggered the anti dilution provisions in the warrants  and  as a consequence  the exercise price of the warrants has been decreased from to per ads  and the number of adss purchasable has increased to  the private placement on february  also triggered the anti dilution provisions of the issuance of december  however  the effect of such dilution was less than of the exercise price and consequently such adjustment is deferred until such time as the accumulation of this adjustment and future adjustments exceed at least of the exercise price 
the issuance of warrants to fusion on october  triggered the anti dilution provisions of the issuance of december  the deferred february  adjustment will be added to this recent adjustment  such that the exercise price of the warrants shall be decreased and the number of adss which may be issued shall increase 
in a private placement that closed on november   certain investors purchased from us a total of  units at a price of per unit 
each unit comprises one ads and one half of one warrant to purchase one ads 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at an exercise price per ads equal to the lower of and the average quoted closing sale price of our adss for the ten trading days ending on the day preceding the day we are informed of the investor s intent to exercise  less a discount 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss purchasable if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants  which ends on november  the issuance of warrants to fusion on october  triggered the anti dilution provisions of this november issuance 
these warrants expired on november  and  warrants lapsed 
on february   we entered into agreements whereby we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price per share of per unit to a total of investors  including a member of our board of directors 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the investors at an exercise price of the lower of the average quoted closing sale price of our ads s for the ten trading days ending on the day proceeding the date of the warrant holder s intent to exercise less a discount  and 
the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss which may be issued  if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants 
the issuance of warrants to fusion was a sale which triggered the anti dilution provisions in the warrants 
all these warrants were exercised in january as part of their warrant agreements  the investors may be entitled to cash payments upon the occurrence of certain major transactions  as defined in the warrant agreements  including change of control provisions 
cash payments are determined in a methodology described in the agreement 
such methodology is impacted by market price 
a major transaction is defined as a merger  reorganization or sale of all or substantially all assets of insignia in which the stockholders of insignia immediately prior to the transaction possess less than of the voting power of the surviving entity or its parent immediately after the transaction 
in  a private placement transaction resulted in an allocation of million to mandatorily redeemable warrants  of which  was allocated to warrants issued  and  was allocated to the additional warrants issuable under certain circumstances 
during the quarter ended june    which represented the relative fair value of the warrants issuable in connection with our private placement  was reclassified from mandatorily redeemable warrants to additional paid in capital 
the reclassification was a result of the expiration of our obligation to issue these warrants 
in september  warrants to purchase  ordinary shares were exercised for net proceeds of approximately  in connection with the exercise of the warrants   was reclassified from mandatorily redeemable warrants to additional paid in capital 
amounts classified as warrants will remain outside of shareholders equity for the life of the warrant or until they are exercised  whichever occurs first 
this classification reflects certain potential cash payments that may occur  should we complete a major transaction  such as a takeover  during the life of the warrants 
limitations in the transaction agreements preclude these investors in question from achieving certain levels of beneficial ownership 
the securities purchase agreement  the warrants and the additional warrants contain the restriction that we may not issue and a selling investor may not purchase  and the warrants and additional warrants may not be exercised for any adss if doing so would cause such investor to beneficially own more than of the total ordinary shares in issue as determined in accordance with section d of the securities exchange act of under the additional warrants  if such investors are prohibited from exercising the additional warrant as a result of the restriction  the selling investor may  at its option and in addition to its other rights under the securities purchase agreement and the warrant  retain the warrant or demand payment  in cash  from us in an amount calculated by the black scholes formula multiplied by the number of adss for which the additional warrant was exercisable  without regard to any limits on exercise 
the restrictions on the levels of beneficial ownership in these documents do not  however  restrict those investors from exercising the warrants or additional warrants up to those limitations  selling adss to decrease their level of beneficial ownership  and exercising the warrants to receive additional adss 
this could result in additional dilution to the holders of our adss and a potential decrease in the price of the adss 
any significant downward pressure on the price of our adss as a result of the exercise of the warrants or additional warrants and the sale of material amounts of our adss could encourage short sales of our adss 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our adss 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we adopted fin effective february  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in certain circumstances 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
although some of the provisions of this statement are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements  the remainder is consistent with fasb s intention to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own shares 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we may need additional financing to sustain our operations 
we had working capital of million at december   and our cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash totaled million at december  we had an operating cash flow deficit of million for the twelve months ended december  and an operating cash flow deficit of million for the year ended december  the sale of our jvm product line to esmertec is expected to provide cash of million in based upon our current forecasts and estimates  our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from on going operations and other liquid sources of cash including the securities subscription and cash generated from the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  we believe that insignia will have sufficient funds to meet its operating and capital requirements through the end of the fiscal year 
if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing including selling additional equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned sales  marketing and product development efforts  which could jeopardize our business 
we only have the right to receive  per trading day  up to an aggregate of million over a period of months under the agreement with fusion capital unless our stock price equals or exceeds  in which case the daily amount may be increased  at the option of insignia  as the price of our shares increases 
fusion capital will not have the right nor be obligated to subscribe for any of our shares on any trading days that the market price of our shares is less than per share 
since we initially registered  shares for sale by fusion capital in addition to  shares issued on exercise of warrants held by insignia  the selling price of our shares to fusion capital will have to average at least per share for us to receive the maximum proceeds of million without registering additional shares 
as of december   new ordinary shares of  were purchased under the fusion capital securities subscription agreement for a total of million  net of issuance costs 
in addition  fusion capital exercised  warrants for  net of issuance costs 
in order to be in compliance with nasdaq rules  we could not sell our ordinary shares to fusion capital at a price below  which represents the greater of the book value per share of our ordinary shares as of september  or the closing sale price per share of our adss on october  if we elect to sell our shares to fusion capital at a price per share below  we first would be required to obtain shareholder approval in order to be in compliance with the nasdaq rules 
under the laws of england and wales  we are not permitted to sell our adss at a purchase price that is less than the nominal value of our ordinary shares 
currently  the nominal value per ordinary share is 
the extent we rely on fusion capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including our financial performance and ability to generate revenues  the prevailing market price of our shares and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
if obtaining sufficient financing from fusion capital were to prove prohibitively expensive  we may need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs 
even if we are able to access the full million under the securities subscription agreement with fusion capital  we may still need additional capital to implement our business  operating and development plans 
based upon our current forecasts and estimates  our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from on going operations and other liquid sources of cash including the securities subscription and cash generated from the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  we believe that insignia will have sufficient funds to meet its operating and capital requirements through the end of the fiscal year 
if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing including selling additional equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned sales  marketing and product development efforts  which could jeopardize our business 
if our stock price does not exceed per share  we could be delisted from nasdaq 
during the twelve months ended december   the closing price of our shares ranged from a high of to a low of 
in  we transferred the listing of our shares from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
under the rules of the nasdaq stock market  our stock price must remain above per share for continued quotation of our shares on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we are required to have total shareholders equity of at least million 
as of december   our shareholders equity was million 
to the extent our shareholders equity declines  or the closing bid price of our shares falls below for the requisite period  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds 
the sale of our shares to fusion capital may cause dilution  and the sale of the shares by fusion capital could cause the price of our shares to decline 
the subscription price for the shares to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the securities subscription agreement with fusion capital will fluctuate based on the price of our shares 
all shares sold to fusion capital under the securities subscription agreement will be freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares purchased from us at any time 
we expect that the shares to be sold to fusion capital will be sold over a period of up to months from the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with the transaction 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of such shares at any given time could cause the trading price of our shares to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
we may never achieve profitability if our ssp product line does not reach desired sales goals 
our future performance depends upon sales of products within our ssp product line 
revenues related to the jeode product line  which was sold to esmertec in april  accounted for of our total revenue for the twelve months ended december  as a result  the ssp product line is our only product line and we expect to rely upon sales of the ssp product for our revenue in the future 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
we have reduced our current expense levels  which will require total revenues of more than million per quarter to achieve an operating profit 
ssp may not achieve or sustain market acceptance or provide the desired revenue levels 
the long and complex process of licensing our ssp product makes our revenue unpredictable 
our revenue is dependent upon our ability to license the ssp product to third parties 
licensing our ssp product is expected to be a long and complex process  which could take longer than the typical six to nine months for our jeode product 
before committing to license our products  potential customers must generally consider a wide range of issues including product benefits  infrastructure requirements  ability to work with existing systems  functionality and reliability 
the process of entering into a development license with a company typically involves lengthy negotiations 
because of the sales cycle  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  a particular prospect might sign a license agreement 
development license fees may be delayed or reduced because of this process 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
if products that integrate our jeode technology do not sell well  we will not receive additional royalty payments on our licenses 
our success depends upon the use of our technology by our licensees in their smart devices 
our licensees undertake a lengthy process of developing systems that use our technology 
until a licensee has sales of its systems incorporating our technology  they will not create commercial use royalties to us 
we expect that the period of time between entering into a development license and actually recognizing commercial use royalties to be lengthy and difficult to predict 
if our license agreement with sun microsystems  inc is terminated or expires without renewal  we would not be able to market our jeode product line through the master distribution license agreement with esmertec 
in the first quarter of  we signed a five year technology license and distribution agreement distribution agreement agreement with sun microsystems  inc under which sun established insignia as a sun authorized virtual machine provider 
the distribution agreement also grants us immediate access to the java compatibility test suite and the java technology source code 
the distribution agreement includes technology sharing and compatibility verification 
under the distribution agreement  we are required to pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode enabled smart device shipped by our customers  plus a royalty on all development licenses between our customers and us 
in the third quarter of  we amended our distribution agreement with sun 
the amendment expanded the scope of the licensed technology  changed the royalty rate  limited the royalty obligations to only per units licensed  established a prepaid royalty schedule and extended the expiration date of the contract from march to june if the distribution agreement with sun terminates or expires without renewal  we would not be able to market our jeode product line 
any disruption in our relationship with sun would likely impair our sales of jeode 
in addition  any termination of the distribution agreement with sun would likely adversely impact our ability to receive amounts to be paid under our agreement with esmertec in connection with the sale of the jvm product line 
we also license software development tool products from other companies to distribute with some of our products 
these third parties may not be able to provide competitive products with adequate features and high quality on a timely basis or to provide sales and marketing cooperation 
further  our products compete with products produced by some of our licensors 
when these licenses terminate or expire  continued license rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms 
we might not be able to obtain similar products to substitute into our tool suites 
we have a history of losses and we must generate significantly greater revenue if we are to achieve profitability 
we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since the second quarter of to achieve profitability  we will have to increase our revenue significantly 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon the success of our ssp product line 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
if we are unable to create revenues from jeode in the form of development license fees  maintenance and support fees  commercial use royalties and non recurring engineering services  our current revenues will be insufficient to sustain our business 
for the fiscal year and we spent and  respectively  of our total revenues on sales and marketing 
we expect to continue to incur disproportionately high sales and marketing expenses in the future 
to market ssp effectively  we must develop market client and server channel markets 
we will continue to incur the expenses for a sales and marketing infrastructure before we recognize significant revenue from sales of the product 
because customers in the mobile device market tend to remain with the same vendor over time  we believe that we must devote significant resources to each potential sale 
if potential customers do not design our products into their systems  the resources we have devoted to the sales prospect would be lost 
if we fail to achieve and sustain significant increases in our quarterly sales  we may not be able to continue to increase our investment in these areas 
with increased expenses  we must significantly increase our revenues if we are to become profitable 
if our new products or product enhancements fail to achieve customer acceptance  or if we fail to manage product transitions  our business reputation will likely suffer and revenues may decline 
the market for mobile devices is fragmented and characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our existing products will become less competitive or obsolete if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that anticipate the features and functionality that customers demand 
the success of our new product introductions will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate industry trends and changes in technology standards  complete and introduce new product designs and features in a timely manner  continue to enhance our existing product lines  respond promptly to customers requirements and preferences 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 
we have had difficulty managing the transition from older products in the past 
for example  between and  we transitioned from our softwindows product line to our ntrigue product line and began preparations for our jeode product line 
during this same period our yearly revenues dropped from a high of million in to a low of million in the decrease in revenues was partly because we did not timely introduce new products which could compensate for the decreasing demand for our softwindows product line 
development delays are commonplace in the software industry 
we have experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products in the past and are likely to experience delays in the future 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis or at all  competitive products  product enhancements and new products that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
in addition  we also face significant risks associated with the development and future deployment of our ssp products and the successful execution of the related business strategy 
with the sale of the jeode product line to esmertec  the ssp product is our sole product line 
during  we began development of a range of ssp products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless carriers to build valuable over the air repair and dynamic capability services 
we only began shipping the ssp product in december and have achieved only minimal sales to date 
we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
additionally  the sales cycle for the ssp products is expected to take longer than the typical six to nine months cycle of the jeode product 
our targeted market is highly competitive 
our ssp product line is targeted for the mobile operator and mobile device market 
the market for these products is fragmented and highly competitive 
this market is also rapidly changing and there are many companies creating products that compete or will compete with ours 
as the industry develops  we expect competition to increase in the future 
this competition may come from existing competitors or other companies that we do not yet know about 
our main competitors include bitfone  doongo and openwave 
if these competitors develop products that are cheaper or provide better performance or functionality than our ssp product line  our market share will drop 
many of our current competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do  and we might not be able to compete successfully against these companies 
competition could force us to reduce the prices of our products  which would result in reduced profit margins and could harm our ability to provide adequate service to our customers 
our pricing model for our software products is based on a derivative usage model with integration and support and maintenance fees  and may be subject to significant pricing pressures  including buy out arrangements 
also  the market may demand alternative pricing models in the future 
a variety of other potential actions by our competitors  including increased promotion and accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products  could also harm our competitive position 
fluctuations in our quarterly results could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
these factors include our ability to close licenses of our ssp products to third parties on a timely basis  the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the mix of and changes in customers to whom our products are sold  the mix of product and service revenue received during the quarter  the mix of development license fees and commercial use royalties received  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us or by our competitors  changes in product pricing  buyouts of commercial use licenses  product life cycles  the level of our sales of third party products  variances in costs in fixed price contracts  purchasing patterns of customers  competitive conditions in the industry  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  business cycles and economic conditions that affect the markets for our products  and extraordinary events  such as litigation  and related charges 
all of these factors are difficult to forecast 
our future operating results may fluctuate due to these and other factors  including our ability to continue to develop innovative and competitive products 
an increasing amount of our sales orders involve products and services that yield revenue over multiple quarters or upon completion of performance 
if license agreements entered into during a quarter do not meet our revenue recognition criteria  even if we meet or exceed our forecast of aggregate licensing and other contracting activity  it is possible that our revenues would not meet expectations 
due to all of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be viewed as an indication of our future performance 
in the past  we have experienced actual performance that did not meet financial market expectations 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results will again be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
international sales of our products  which we expect to comprise a significant portion of total revenues  expose us to the business and economic risks of international operations 
sales from outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal year and  respectively  and are expected to increase over time 
we expect to market ssp in europe 
economic conditions in europe generally and fluctuations in the value of the euro against the us dollar and british pound sterling could impair our revenues and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
product defects can be expensive to fix and may cause us to lose customers 
our software products  like all software products  may have undetected errors or compatibility problems 
this is particularly true when a product is first introduced or a new version is released 
despite our testing  our products might be shipped with errors 
if this were to happen  our products could be rejected by customers  or there might be costly delays in correcting the problems 
our products are increasingly used in systems that interact directly with the general public  such as in transportation and medical systems 
in systems such as these  the failure of our product could cause substantial property damage or personal injury  which would expose us to product liability claims 
our products are used for applications in business systems where the failure of our product could be linked to substantial economic loss 
our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and other claims 
it is likely  however  that these provisions are not effective in all circumstances and in all jurisdictions 
we may not have adequate insurance against product liability risks and renewal of our insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
further  our errors and omissions insurance may not be adequate to cover claims 
a product liability claim or claim for economic loss brought against us could lead to unexpected large expenses and lost sales 
also  if we ever had to recall our product due to errors or other problems  it would cost us a great deal of time  effort and expense 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
the measures we have taken to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations might not be sufficient 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any major interruptions in our operations because of a catastrophic event 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or sell our products 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and operations personnel 
we do not have agreements with any of our key personnel that require them to work for us for a specific term  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense in the san francisco bay area  where our us operations are headquartered 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors could introduce similar or superior products  and we could lose market share 
we depend on our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary 
our competitors could independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which software piracy of our products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
the status of us patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the united states patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
patents have been granted on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may issue that relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into our products 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and third parties may infringe our proprietary rights  either of which may result in lawsuits  distraction of management and the impairment of our business 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products based on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims 
third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future 
infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could prevent us from selling our products

we have not suspended registration statements for more than days in any month period in the past 
however  because registration statement number was not declared effective by the securities and exchange commission by may   we made available to certain investors an additional total of  adss 
three of four investors have purchased their adss and one investor has yet to purchase the shares available to it 
the purchase price shareholders have paid or will pay per additional ads is the nominal value  or per ads  which is the lowest amount these shares can be purchased under english law 
if we issue additional adss under these obligations  the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted

stock price volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by us and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against high technology companies

the rights of holders of our shares are governed by english law  including the companies act  and by our memorandum and articles of association 
the rights of holders of our adss are also affected by english law
