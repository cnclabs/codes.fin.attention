income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net income 
at the end of  gatx completed a reorganization which resulted in changes in management structure and reporting 
as a result  gatx now provides its services and products through four operating segments rail  air  technology and specialty 
previously  gatx reported its operating segments as gatx rail and financial services  which included the results of its business units  air  technology  specialty finance including american steamship company asc  and venture finance 
all reported amounts have been restated to conform to the revised segment presentation 
along with the change to reporting segments  gatx revised its methodology for allocating corporate sg a expenses to the segments 
corporate sg a expenses relate to administration and support functions performed at the corporate office 
such expenses include information technology  human resources  legal  financial support and executive costs 
under the revised allocation methodology  directly attributable expenses are generally allocated to the segments  and shared costs are retained in other 
amounts allocated to the segments are approximated based on management s best estimate and judgment of direct support services 
rail s previously reported segment net income for and has been restated to incorporate the revised methodology for sg a allocations 
debt balances and interest expense were allocated based upon a fixed leverage ratio for each individual operating segment across all reporting periods  expressed as a ratio of debt to equity 
rail s leverage ratio was set at  air s leverage ratio was set at  technology s leverage ratio was set at excluding nonrecourse debt  and specialty s leverage ratio was set at any gatx debt and related interest expense that remained after this allocation methodology was assigned to other in each period 
management believes this leverage and interest expense allocation methodology gives an accurate indication of each operating segment s risk adjusted financial return 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
following is management s discussion and analysis of gatx s comparative results of its segments  in addition to results of other and discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gatx rail challenging market conditions in the north american rail industry continued to affect rail in an oversupply of certain car types in the railcar market  short backlogs at new car manufacturers  and a weak economic environment has resulted in lease rates that are still below peak lease rates of the late s 
aggressive competition from other lessors pressured lease rates as well 
despite an improving economy in north america  the earnings recovery from rail s existing fleet is likely to be gradual due to the average lease term of rail s portfolio and that approximately of rail s revenue comes from the chemical sector  which has also lagged the general economy 
with an average lease term of five years  a significant portion of the north american fleet comes up for renewal each year 
during  approximately  cars previously leased in a stronger market at more attractive rates were renewed with the same customer or placed with a new customer assigned at market rates which were lower on average than the previous rate 
although the downward trend in absolute lease rates has abated somewhat  rail anticipates that approximately  cars during will also be renewed or assigned at rates generally lower than the previous contract rate  slowing the pace of rail s earnings recovery 
in  utilization of the north american fleet improved from to 
the increase in utilization from the prior year end was the result of aggressive efforts to improve the renewal success rate  to market specific car types and to scrap older  uneconomic cars from the fleet 
active cars in north america increased by approximately  cars after two consecutive years of decline 
the acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter in of a fleet of  covered hoppers on long term lease drove the increase in active cars 
investment in new cars for north america increased in over the prior year 
rail entered into agreements in late with trinity industries  inc and union tank car company to acquire new cars at pre negotiated prices 
under this program  rail took delivery of approximately  new cars in rail continued to purchase new cars and actively pursue secondary market transactions in order to capitalize on the slowly improving market 
as the market improves  increased railcar manufacturing backlogs may affect new car prices 
the recent sharp increase in steel prices may also affect new car prices 
the trend of increasing costs for maintaining the north american fleet continued in despite fewer cars in the total fleet  maintenance costs rose  largely due to an increase in the number of car assignments 
in addition  maintenance costs were adversely affected in as a result of an american association of railroads aar requirement to replace bolsters on certain cars see discussion below 
the trend in maintenance costs is expected to continue in due to additional compliance work  anticipated high assignment levels  and completing the remainder of the bolster replacement work 
in  rail s european operations generally experienced a more favorable market environment compared to its north america operations 
rail s wholly owned european subsidiaries dec and kvg primarily serve the tank car market  and aae  a european joint venture  primarily serves the general freight car market 
fleet utilization at both kvg and aae is in the high s 
aae has benefited from the high growth rates of shipping activity at european seaports 
dec s performance has been negatively affected by a weak polish economy 
the long term outlook for the european market is positive 
the european union is encouraging the use of railways in place of the congested road system 
kvg and dec are in the early stages of integrating their tank car operations and dec is moving from its high cost trip lease business model to a low cost operating lease business model as it continues to improve its cost structure 
this transition may negatively affect short term earnings  but is expected to result in long term operational efficiencies 
rail acquired the remaining interest in kvg in december as a result  rail s year over year income comparability is affected by the inclusion of of kvg s results in compared to in kvg s revenues converted to us dollars were approximately million in kvg s operating results were affected by a continued weak european economy  offset by strong new car additions  as its primary markets of chemical  petroleum  mineral and liquid petroleum gas remained stable 
in addition  kvg was instrumental in placing dec tank cars in service outside of poland  a key european strategy for rail 
gross income components of rail s gross income are summarized below in millions lease income asset remarketing income fees other revenues share of affiliates earnings total gross income rail s gross income of million was million higher than excluding the impact of kvg in both periods  gross income was down million from the decrease was primarily driven by lower north american lease income resulting from lower average lease rates and fewer railcars on lease for most of the year 
although average renewal rates continue to be lower than rail s prior contractual rate  the percentage decline in renewal rates improved during share of affiliates earnings of million were slightly lower than the prior year 
excluding kvg s pretax earnings of million in  share of affiliates earnings in increased million 
the increase was the result of favorable maintenance expense at domestic affiliates combined with a larger fleet and favorable foreign exchange rates at a foreign affiliate 
ownership costs components of rail s ownership costs are summarized below in millions depreciation interest  net operating lease expense total ownership costs ownership costs were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of kvg 
other costs and expenses components of rail s other costs and expenses are summarized below in millions maintenance expense other operating expenses selling  general and administrative reversal provision for possible losses reduction in workforce charges fair value adjustments for derivatives 
total other costs and expenses maintenance expense of million in increased million from excluding kvg  maintenance expense increased million in the variance is due primarily to the increase in car assignments discussed above 
both and results include comparable levels of maintenance costs for certain railroad mandated repairs 
in  the aar issued a series of early warning letters that required all owners of railcars in the us  canada and mexico to inspect or replace certain bolsters manufactured from the mid s to by a now bankrupt supplier 
rail owned approximately  railcars equipped with bolsters that were required to be inspected or replaced 
due dates for inspection or replacement of the bolsters ranged from september  to december  depending on car type and service 
as of december   bolsters on approximately  cars have been replaced 
maintenance expense included million attributable to the inspection and replacement of bolsters 
management expects the remaining costs of bolster replacements to approximate million in in the second quarter of  the federal railroad administration issued a railworthiness directive bar car directive which required rail to inspect and repair  if necessary  a certain class of its cars that were built or modified with reinforcing bars prior to approximately  of rail s owned railcars were affected by the bar car directive 
the unfavorable impact on rail s operating results for was approximately million after tax  including lost revenue  inspection  cleaning and replacement car costs  which were partially offset by gains on the accelerated scrapping of affected cars 
as of year end  substantially all of the subject tank cars were removed from rail s fleet 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million increased million in excluding kvg  sg a expenses decreased million due to cost savings initiatives 
in  rail recorded a reversal of provision for possible losses of million resulting from improvement in portfolio quality  recoveries of bad debts  and more favorable aging of rail s receivables 
taxes rail s income tax expense was million in  a decrease of million from the amount of million 
rail s taxes included a million deferred tax benefit at dec attributable to a reduction in polish tax rates 
cumulative effect of accounting change in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  rail completed a review of all recorded goodwill in fair values were established using discounted cash flows 
based on this review  rail recorded a one time  non cash impairment charge of million related to dec in the charge is non operational in nature and was recognized as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  in the consolidated statements of income 
the impairment charge was due primarily to lessened expectations of projected cash flows based on market conditions at the time of the review and a lower long term growth rate projected for dec 
net income rail s net income of million in increased million from the prior year 
income before the cumulative effect of accounting change decreased million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower north american lease income driven by lower average lease rates 
gatx air challenging conditions in the aviation industry continued to negatively affect air in although the industry appears to be recovering from its severe downturn  aircraft lessors continued to experience lower lease rates  credit defaults and asset impairments during specifically  aircraft over years in age are proving to be more difficult to lease and present the greatest uncertainty in value 
rents on older aircraft continued to decline in  while rents on newer aircraft stabilized 
until the air market more fully recovers  low lease rates  defaults and potential impairments will continue to pressure earnings 
for example  gatx owns a interest in pembroke  an aircraft lessor and manager based in ireland 
pembroke currently has six fully utilized boeing aircraft in its portfolio 
boeing s program is in jeopardy of being cancelled due to weak demand for the aircraft 
this in turn could adversely affect the future marketability of these aircraft and may result in impairment 
air s owned portfolio had an average age of eight years five years on a weighted average  net book value basis at the end of with a relatively new fleet  air achieved almost full utilization in at december   less than of air s portfolio was available for lease  over were on lease with customers  and the remaining were subject to signed letters of intent to lease with customers 
air achieved this utilization level by successfully placing owned aircraft during  including six new and existing aircraft 
air has entered into letters of intent or leases for of owned aircraft whose leases are scheduled to expire in in addition  as of march   air has entered into letters of intent to lease three new aircraft scheduled for delivery in additionally  air is committed for two new aircraft deliveries in  which are still available for lease 
air generates income primarily from operating leases  many which have floating rents that are periodically adjusted based on current interest rates 
air usually match funds floating rate leases with floating rate debt to offset the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
air s other significant source of revenue is fee income and results from remarketing and administering aircraft in its joint ventures as well as managing aircraft for third parties 
air s level of fee income can be unpredictable  varying with the performance of the managed fleet and air s success in remarketing and selling aircraft 
despite the current market conditions  air expects to grow both its owned and managed portfolios 
besides its existing aircraft commitments  air plans to selectively invest in attractive aircraft opportunities if and when they arise 
additionally  air will continue to pursue new partnership and portfolio management opportunities 
gross income components of air s gross income are summarized below in millions lease income interest income 
asset remarketing income 
gain on sale of securities 
fees other revenues share of affiliates earnings total gross income air s gross income of million was million higher than the increase was primarily driven by higher lease income due to the full year revenue recognition on new aircraft which were delivered at various times during  and an additional six new aircraft deliveries which were received and put on lease in although gross income increased from the prior year  lower lease rates due to weak market conditions resulted in lower average yields 
other income also contributed million to the increase  primarily attributable to the recognition of previously collected maintenance reserves 
these maintenance reserves were entirely offset by related impairment charges taken on the underlying aircraft 
share of affiliates earnings of million was million higher than the prior year 
the increase from the prior year is primarily due to impairment losses that were recognized in on a fleet of fokker and fokker aircraft owned by air s owned pembroke affiliate 
ownership costs components of air s ownership costs are summarized below in millions depreciation interest  net operating lease expense total ownership costs ownership costs of million in were million higher than in the increase was primarily due to the million increase in depreciation resulting from higher operating lease balances due to full year depreciation on new aircraft deliveries in and six new deliveries received and put on lease in interest expense also contributed million to the increase as a result of higher debt balances due to the new aircraft deliveries in and  slightly offset by lower interest rates 
excluding an accrual reversal in  operating lease expense in was lower by million due to fewer leased in aircraft compared to the prior year 
operating lease expense of million in was net of a credit of million for the reversal of a loss accrual recorded in prior years 
gatx was a lessee of an aircraft under an operating lease running through gatx had subleased the aircraft to an unrelated third party with an initial lease term expiring in prior to  as a result of financial difficulties of the sublessee as well as concerns about subleasing the aircraft for the period to  the company recorded a loss for the costs expected to be incurred on the operating lease in excess of the anticipated revenues 
in  the company restructured the terms of the lease  ultimately acquiring ownership of the aircraft  and leasing it to a new customer 
as a result  the million accrual was reversed as a credit to operating lease expense 
other costs and expenses components of air s other costs and expenses are summarized below in millions maintenance expense and other operating expenses selling  general and administrative provision for possible losses 
asset impairment charges total other costs and expenses total other costs and expenses increased by million in primarily due to the increase in sg a costs  the provision for losses and asset impairment charges

improvement in share of affiliates earnings was offset by an increase in the provision for possible losses due to the air canada bankruptcy and increases in sg a expenses 
gatx technology services continued low demand for new it equipment in resulted in lower than expected new lease originations for technology 
the gradual pace of the economic recovery during caused businesses to continue to rationalize their capital spending 
as a result  it leasing customers elected to retain their existing it equipment  rather than acquire new it equipment 
technology expects that the economic recovery will continue in and it customers will re evaluate their decision to retain older equipment  which in turn will result in increased new lease originations and portfolio acquisitions 
technology responded to the economic and industry conditions by developing strategies and making organizational changes to maximize profitability 
capitalizing on its customers preference to retain existing it equipment  technology successfully renewed and rewrote existing lease contracts 
in addition  many technology customers retained their existing it equipment at the expiration of the initial lease term on a month to month basis 
these transactions generated additional lease income  which offset the reduced gains from asset dispositions since less it equipment was returned 
on the expense side  technology reorganized its infrastructure to be more efficient and responsive to the needs of its customers 
the reorganization resulted in lower sg a costs in compared to prior years 
sustainable growth in technology s earnings will be difficult to achieve without growth in its asset base 
technology earns lease income throughout the contractual term of a lease as well as additional lease income and or gains from asset disposition after the contractual term  typically three years 
recent profitability has been enhanced by income earned after the contractual lease term from investments made between and however  since  technology s asset base has been declining  as the level of new investments in and has not offset the run off of its portfolio 
because of lower investment levels  the earnings impact from new investments is not expected to be as significant as in the past 
to enhance future earnings  technology plans to generate additional fee income by leveraging its asset knowledge and infrastructure to provide advisory services to its customers

lease income of million decreased million due to declining average operating lease and finance lease balances and the impact of lower average yields due principally to the run off of the higher yielding transactions from a portfolio acquisition 
asset remarketing income of million in decreased million due to fewer returns of leased equipment  as technology s customers had more lease renewals and month to month lease activity 
the portfolio acquisition of leased equipment had an average lease term age of months resulting in unusually high asset remarketing income in in  technology recorded gains on extinguishment of nonrecourse debt of million  million of which was associated with one lease investment

gatx specialty finance the assets of specialty s portfolio declined during as a result of the decision in late to curtail investment in the specialty finance portfolio and to sell or otherwise run off the venture finance portfolio 
during  the canadian and uk venture finance loan portfolios and a interest in the associated warrants were sold 
the us venture finance loan portfolio  which had been retained along with associated warrants  continued to run off 
investment volume was primarily related to prior funding commitments 
because of the reduced portfolio size  the specialty and venture finance businesses were operationally consolidated under a single management team to realize cost savings 
management expects specialty s assets to continue declining over the next several years  as new investment is not expected to offset the continued run off of the portfolios 
the loans related to the venture finance portfolio are expected to run off by the end of  the majority of which are scheduled to be repaid by the end of additionally  the run off of the specialty finance portfolio may accelerate as it is periodically reviewed to determine if assets should be sold based on market conditions 
prospectively  new investments are expected to be generally limited to marine equipment and secondary market transactions 
as the portfolios continue to decline  future earnings will be unpredictable because of the uncertain timing of gains on the sale of assets from the specialty finance portfolio and gains from the sale of securities associated with the venture finance warrant portfolio 
management expects to achieve additional sg a reductions as efficiencies are realized on the declining portfolio

asset impairment charges of million in increased million and were unusually high due to charges related to customers bankruptcies of million  a portion which was offset by gains on extinguishment of debt 
additionally  losses of million were recorded in as the result of several mid term lease rewrite transactions  which include a portion of the customer s equipment being returned early 
under the terms of the transactions  rent flows on the returned equipment are typically incorporated into the rewritten lease and underlying equipment retained by the customer 
an impairment charge on the portion of the equipment returned by the customer may be recognized  if applicable

asset impairment charges decreased million due to the absence of impairment charges related to telecommunications equipment 
in  asset impairments at specialty reached a historically high level due primarily to valuation issues on telecommunication leases and bonds originated by gatx in the late s 
the recessionary economy  the sharp decline in the stock market  and a dramatic reduction in funding available to newer stage telecommunication companies caused many business failures in the telecom industry and losses in specialty s portfolio

gatx financial corporation gfc  formerly known as gatx capital corporation gcc  was a party to litigation arising from the issuance by the federal aviation administration of airworthiness directive in  the effect of which significantly reduced the amount of freight that ten aircraft were authorized to carry 
gatx airlog  a california partnership in which a subsidiary of gcc was a partner  through a series of contractors  modified these aircraft from passenger to freighter configuration between and gcc reached settlements covering five of the aircraft  and the remaining five were the subject of this litigation 
on february   a jury found that gatx airlog breached certain warranties under the applicable aircraft modification agreements  and fraudulently failed to disclose information to the operators of the aircraft 
in  gcc reached settlement with each of the plaintiffs in this litigation 
gatx had recorded a pre tax charge of million in to accrue for its obligation under the various settlement agreements 
upon settlement of these matters  million of the previously recorded provision was reversed in during  gatx recorded a pre tax charge of million related to reductions in workforce 
the charge in was predominantly related to a reduction in corporate overhead costs associated with management s intent to exit the venture business and curtail investment in the specialty finance sector 
in  this action was part of gatx s previously announced initiative to reduce sg a expenses in response to economic conditions at that time 
the reduction in workforce charge for both years included involuntary employee separation and benefit costs well as occupancy and other costs

in addition to the billion of assets recorded on the balance sheet  gatx utilizes approximately billion of other assets  such as railcars and aircraft  which were financed with operating leases and therefore are not recorded on the balance sheet

the following table presents continuing assets on and off balance sheet by segment in millions on off on off balance balance total balance balance total december sheet sheet assets sheet sheet assets rail       air     technology specialty   other restricted cash restricted cash of million decreased by million from the decrease is primarily due to rail s disposal of a leveraged lease commitment on passenger rail equipment  which included restricted cash of million 
receivables receivables of million  including finance leases and loans  decreased million compared to the prior year 
technology and specialty receivables reflect lower finance lease balances as a result of portfolio run off exceeding new volume 
specialty also sold the uk and canadian venture related loan portfolios in december allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses inherent in the investment portfolio for which reserving is appropriate 
in addition to establishing loss estimates for known troubled investments  this estimate involves consideration of historical loss experience  present economic conditions  collateral values  and the state of the markets in which gatx operates 
gatx records a provision for possible losses in each operating segment as well as in other  targeting and overall allowance for possible losses in accordance with established gatx policy 
this overall allowance for possible losses is measured and reported as a percentage of total reservable assets 
reservable assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap include loans  direct finance leases  leveraged leased and receivables 
the following summarizes changes in gatx s consolidated allowance for possible losses in millions december balance at the beginning of the year provision for possible losses charges to allowance recoveries and other balance at end of the year the following table presents the allowance for possible losses by segment in millions december rail air technology specialty other there were no material changes in estimation methods and assumptions for the allowance that took place during the allowance for possible losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy by considering changes in economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the reservable portfolio as of december  the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  which could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
the allowance for possible losses of million decreased million from and represented of reservable assets  a decline from in the prior year 
the decrease in the allowance for possible losses as a percentage of reservable assets in was driven by the general improvement in the average quality of gatx s portfolio as well as the large decrease in venture finance assets  which were reserved at a relatively higher rate than the rest of the portfolio 
net charge offs  which is calculated as charge offs less recoveries  totaled million for the year  a decrease of million from the charge offs were primarily air  specialty and technology investments 
charge offs were primarily in specialty s venture portfolio and technology s investments 
specialty s activity included a million reduction in the allowance due to the sale of the uk and canadian venture related loan portfolios completed in december non performing investments finance leases and loans that are days or more past due  or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection of payments related thereto  are generally classified as non performing 
non performing assets also include operating lease assets which are subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as they are not considered reservable assets 
the allowance for possible losses  discussed above  relates only to rent and other receivables  finance leases and loans 
non performing investments do not include operating lease assets that are off lease or held for sale  investments within joint ventures or off balance sheet assets 
lease or interest income accrued but not collected is reversed when a lease or loan is classified as non performing 
payments received on non performing leases and loans for which the ultimate collectibility of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions 
otherwise  such collections are credited to income when received 
the following summarizes non performing assets by segment in millions december rail air technology specialty non performing investments at december  were million  million lower than the prior year amount of million 
the decrease in non performing leases and loans was driven by improvement in the technology portfolio 
operating lease assets  facilities and other net operating lease assets and facilities increased million from primarily due to railcar investments 
rail took delivery of approximately  new cars in under its committed purchase program and also acquired  cars in december  which are on a long term lease with a customer 
progress payments gatx classifies amounts deposited toward the construction of wholly owned aircraft and other equipment  including capitalized interest  as progress payments 
progress payments made for aircraft owned by joint ventures in which gatx participates are classified as investments in affiliated companies 
progress payments decreased million from million in to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of million of progress payments to operating lease assets for aircraft delivered during also in  rail disposed of a leveraged lease commitment on passenger rail equipment that included million of progress payments 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies increased million in gatx invested million and million in joint ventures in and  respectively

the following table shows gatx s investment in affiliated companies by segment in millions december rail air technology specialty recoverable income taxes recoverable income taxes of million at december  represent estimated refunds from prior years as a result of carrying back the net tax operating loss 
recoverable income taxes received during were approximately million 
goodwill  net goodwill  net  was million  an increase of million as compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to a million purchase accounting adjustment related to rail s purchase of the remaining of kvg and a foreign currency exchange effect of million 
the company s changes in carrying value of goodwill are further discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other investments other investments of million were comparable to the prior year and include million of investments classified as available for sale 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s available for sale securities 
other assets other assets of million were million lower than the prior year due to a decrease in capitalized costs from rail s disposal of the leveraged lease commitment discussed above and a decrease in the fair value of derivatives 
liabilities total liabilities decreased to billion in from billion in in addition to the billion of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  gatx has approximately billion of off balance sheet debt related to assets that are financed with operating leases 
the billion of off balance sheet debt represents the present value of gatx s committed future operating lease payments at a discount rate 
accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses were million  a decrease of million from the prior year end largely due to the january funding of a portion of the kvg purchase price 
kvg was acquired in december debt total debt decreased million from the year end primarily due to decreases in recourse and nonrecourse long term debt of million and million  respectively 
nonrecourse debt decreased as investments at technology continued to decline year over year 
rail s disposition of a leveraged lease commitment on passenger rail equipment included million of liabilities  consisting primarily of nonrecourse debt  which were assumed by the buyer 
gatx  including its principal subsidiary gfc  issued million in long term debt in significant borrowings in included secured financing supported by the european credit agencies eca and the export import bank of the united states ex im for aircraft deliveries  railcar secured financings  senior unsecured term notes  technology nonrecourse financing and convertible debt

shareholders equity shareholders equity increased million from reflecting net income of million  issuance of common stock of million and changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  partially offset by dividends paid of million 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss was driven by foreign currency translation gains due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  euro and zloty and reduced minimum pension liability  slightly offset by unrealized losses on derivative instruments 
cash flow discussion gatx generates a significant amount of cash from its operating activities and proceeds from its investment portfolio  which is used to service debt  pay dividends  and fund portfolio investments and capital additions 
a continued weak environment could decrease demand for gatx s services  which in turn could impact the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds 
net cash provided by continuing operations net cash provided by continuing operations of million decreased million compared to the impact of reduced investment volume and portfolio run off in was largely offset by the receipt of recoverable income taxes and lower pension plan contributions 
comparison between periods is also affected by other changes in working capital 
portfolio investments and capital additions portfolio investments and capital additions of million decreased million from the following table presents portfolio investments and capital additions by segment in millions december rail air technology specialty other rail invested million in  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to railcar investments related to the committed railcar purchase program  railcar investments at kvg and the fourth quarter acquisition of a fleet of covered hoppers 
portfolio investments and capital additions at air of million were million lower than the prior year  primarily due to million fewer aircraft progress payments and deliveries 
air investments included million of progress payments and million of final delivery payments for six aircraft in technology investments of million approximate the prior year 
investments at specialty were significantly lower in as a result of the run off of the venture business and curtailment in specialty investments 
future portfolio investments and capital additions excluding contractual commitments will depend on market conditions and opportunities to acquire desirable assets 
portfolio proceeds portfolio proceeds of million decreased million from the decrease was primarily due to lower proceeds from disposals of leased equipment and a decrease in finance lease payments received  partially offset by increases in loan principal received and cash distributions from joint venture investments 
proceeds from other asset sales proceeds from other asset sales of million in primarily relate to railcar scrappings 
net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was million in compared to million in net proceeds from issuance of long term debt were million in significant financings in included the million commercial paper cp conduit securitization facility  million of senior unsecured term notes  million of eca aircraft financing  million of aircraft financing from the ex im  million of technology nonrecourse financing  and the issuance of convertible debt of million 
liquidity and capital resources general gatx has historically funded investments and met its obligations through cash flow from operations  portfolio proceeds including proceeds from asset sales  uncommitted money market lines  committed revolving credit facilities  the issuance of unsecured debt  and a variety of secured borrowings 
gatx utilizes both the domestic and international bank and capital markets 
in december  gatx announced its decision to exit its venture finance business and curtail investment in specialty finance 
the former business units  specialty finance and venture finance  are now managed as one business segment  specialty 
in addition  gatx experienced a relatively weak investment environment for its technology segment over the last few years 
as a result  assets of  million including million of off balance sheet assets as of december  in these segments decreased by million from the end of this run off has caused cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds to run at a level of over billion during both and looking forward  specialty s venture loan portfolio will substantially run off by the end of and the rate of decline in the remaining assets in the specialty segment could slow 
combined with the effect of the reduced investment in technology over the last few years  gatx expects that both cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds will decline in despite this  gatx believes its current liquidity remains strong due to its cash position  available and committed credit lines  lower scheduled debt maturities relative to recent years  and more cost effective access to the capital markets relative to recent years 
credit facilities gfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of gatx  has revolving credit facilities totaling million 
gfc s credit facilities include three agreements for million  million  and million expiring in   and  respectively 
at december   availability under all credit facilities was million  with million of letters of credit outstanding under the most recent facility 
the million and million facilities  which closed in july and june  respectively  are intended to be utilized to meet short term funding requirements 
the million facility  which expires in june  was originally established as a back up line 
the company intends to replace this facility with one of similar terms for the purpose of funding short term requirements 
restrictive covenants all revolving credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain a defined net worth and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facilities contain certain negative pledge provisions  including an asset coverage test 
terms of the million credit facility also include a limitation on liens condition for borrowings on this facility 
as defined in the credit facilities  the net worth of gfc at december  was billion  which was in excess of the most restrictive minimum net worth requirement of billion 
additionally  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as defined by the credit facilities was x for the period ended december   in excess of the most restrictive covenant of x 
the indentures for gfc s public debt also contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on loans  advances or investments in related parties including gatx and dividends it may distribute to gatx 
certain of the indentures also contain limitation on liens provisions that limit the amount of secured indebtedness that gfc may incur  subject to several exceptions  including those permitting an unlimited amount of purchase money indebtedness and non recourse indebtedness 
in addition to the other specified exceptions  gfc would be able to incur liens securing a maximum of million of additional indebtedness as of december  based on the most restrictive limitation on liens provision 
the covenants in the credit facilities and indentures effectively limit the ability of gfc to transfer funds to gatx in the form of loans  advances or dividends 
at december   the maximum amount that gfc could transfer to gatx without violating its financial covenants was million  implying that million of subsidiary net assets were restricted 
restricted assets are defined as the subsidiary s equity  less intercompany receivables from the parent company  less the amount that could be transferred to the parent company 
in addition to the credit facilities and indentures  gfc and its subsidiaries are subject to financial covenants related to certain bank financings 
gatx does not anticipate any covenant violation in gfc s credit facilities  bank financings  or indentures  nor does gatx anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict its operations or its ability to procure additional financing 
as december   gfc was in compliance with the covenants and conditions of all of its credit facilities 
long term financing secured financings are comprised of the sale leaseback of railcars  loans secured by railcars and aircraft  technology nonrecourse financing  and a cp conduit securitization facility 
the railcar sale leasebacks qualify as operating leases and the assets or liabilities associated with this equipment are not recorded on the balance sheet 
in march  million was funded through the cp conduit securitization facility 
in december  the cp conduit securitization facility was restructured as a million facility 
in november  gfc registered billion of unsecured debt securities and pass through certificates under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
pass through certificates are securities that evidence an ownership interest in a pass through trust 
the property held by each pass through trust may include promissory notes secured by railcars or aircraft that are owned or leased by gfc 
as of december   million of senior unsecured notes had been issued against the shelf registration 
during  gatx issued million of long term convertible debt 
including the financing activity of gfc  gatx issued a total of million and repaid  million of long term debt 
other significant financings in included million of aircraft financing guaranteed by the european export credit agencies  million of technology nonrecourse financing and million of aircraft financing guaranteed by the us export import bank 
credit ratings the availability of the above funding options may be adversely impacted by certain factors including the global capital market environment and outlook as well as gfc s financial performance and outlook 
access to capital markets at competitive interest rates is partly dependent on gfc s credit rating as determined primarily by rating agencies such as s p and moody s 
on april   s p downgraded gfc s long term unsecured debt from bbb to bbb and removed its ratings from credit watch 
gfc s current outlook from s p is stable 
on march   moody s affirmed the credit rating on gfc s long term unsecured debt at baa but revised the rating outlook to negative from stable 
gfc s existing credit rating situation has increased the cost of borrowing and constrained gfc s access to the commercial paper market 
one of the factors that the rating agencies monitor in reviewing gfc s credit rating is its use of secured debt 
in particular  s p monitors the ratio of gfc s secured assets as a percentage of total assets 
over the last two years  this ratio has increased substantially as gfc has financed new aircraft deliveries with secured debt supported by the eca and the ex im 
gatx currently believes that its secured asset ratio can be maintained at levels acceptable to the rating agencies 
however  if gfc became unable to access unsecured financing in the future  it may have to rely on secured financing and could suffer a credit rating downgrade if the resulting increase in its secured asset ratio became unacceptable to one or both rating agencies 
liquidity position gfc expects that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations for through a combination of its current cash position  projected cash flow from operations  portfolio proceeds  eca financing  and its revolving credit facilities 
gfc previously arranged financing supported by the eca to fund gfc s airbus a aircraft deliveries 
approximately million of eca financing is expected to be funded in  secured by three deliveries 
contractual commitments at december   gatx s contractual commitments  including debt maturities  lease payments  and unconditional purchase obligations were in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt  capital lease obligations operating leases recourse   operating leases nonrecourse unconditional purchase obligations other the carrying value of long term debt is adjusted for fair value hedges 
as of december   long term debt of  million excludes a fair value adjustment of million 
the adjustment for qualifying fair value hedges is excluded from the above table as such amount does not represent a contractual commitment with a fixed amount or maturity date 
other represents gatx s obligation under the terms of the dec acquisition agreement to cause dec to make qualified investments of million by december  to the extent there are not satisfactory investment opportunities during  dec may invest in long term securities for purposes of future investment 
unconditional purchase obligations at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations of million consisted primarily of commitments to purchase railcars and scheduled aircraft acquisitions 
gatx had commitments of related to the committed railcar purchase program  entered into in gatx also had commitments of million for orders and options for interests in five new aircraft to be delivered in and additional unconditional purchase obligations include million of other rail related commitments 
at december   gatx s unconditional purchase obligations by segment were in millions payments due by period total thereafter rail air technology specialty 


guarantees in connection with certain investments or transactions  gatx has entered into various commercial commitments  such as guarantees and standby letters of credit  which could potentially require performance in the event of demands by third parties 
similar to gatx s balance sheet investments  these guarantees expose gatx to credit and market risk  accordingly gatx evaluates commitment and other contingent obligations using the same techniques used to evaluate funded transactions 
lease and loan payment guarantees generally involve guaranteeing repayment of the financing utilized to acquire assets being leased by an affiliate to customers  and are in lieu of making direct equity investments in the affiliate 
gatx is not aware of any event of default which would require it to satisfy these guarantees  and expects the affiliates to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy their lease and loan obligations 
asset residual value guarantees represent gatx s commitment to third parties that an asset or group of assets will be worth a specified amount at the end of a lease term 
approximately of the asset residual value guarantees are related to rail equipment 
based on known and expected market conditions  management does not believe that the asset residual value guarantees will result in any negative financial impact to gatx 
gatx believes these asset residual value guarantees will likely generate future income in the form of fees and residual sharing proceeds 
gatx and its subsidiaries are also parties to letters of credit and bonds 
no material claims have been made against these obligations 
at december   gatx does not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments because performance is not anticipated to be required 
gatx s commercial commitments at december  were in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total thereafter affiliate debt guarantees recourse to gatx asset residual value guarantees lease and loan payment guarantees other loan guarantees 

guarantees standby letters of credit and bonds pension contributions in  gatx contributed million to its funded and unfunded pension plans 
in  the company expects to make payments of approximately million with respect to its pension plans 
additional contributions will be dependent on a number of factors including plans asset investment returns and actuarial experience 
subject to the impact of these factors  the company may make additional material plan contributions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant factors and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as critical accounting policies operating lease assets and facilities operating lease assets and facilities are stated principally at cost 
assets acquired under capital leases are included in operating lease assets and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities 
provisions for depreciation include the amortization of the cost of capital leases 
operating lease assets and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method to an estimated residual value 
railcars  locomotives  aircraft  marine vessels  buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
technology equipment is generally depreciated to an estimated residual value over the term of the lease contract 
the company periodically reviews the appropriateness of depreciable lives and residual values based on physical and economic factors  as well as existing market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets  such as operating lease assets and facilities  is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimated future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease term  operating costs  life of the asset and disposition proceeds 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the residual values used in the accounting for finance leases 
when conditions indicate the residual value has declined  the company recognizes the accounting impact in that period 
allowance for possible losses the purpose of the allowance is to provide an estimate of credit losses with respect to reservable assets inherent in the investment portfolio 
reservable assets include gross receivables  loans and finance leases 
gatx s estimate of the amount of loss incurred in each period requires consideration of historical loss experience  judgments about the impact of present economic conditions  collateral values  and the state of the markets in which gatx participates  in addition to specific losses for known troubled accounts 
gatx charges off amounts that management considers unrecoverable from obligors or the disposition of collateral 
gatx assesses the recoverability of investments by considering several factors  including customer payment history and financial position 
the allowance for possible losses is periodically reviewed for adequacy considering changes in economic conditions  collateral values  credit quality indicators and customer specific circumstances 
gatx believes that the allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  because the allowance is based on judgments and estimates  it is possible that those judgments and estimates could change in the future  causing a corresponding change in the recorded allowance 
investments in affiliated companies investments in affiliated companies represent investments in domestic and foreign companies and joint ventures that are in businesses similar to those of gatx  such as commercial aircraft leasing  rail equipment leasing  technology equipment leasing and other business activities  including ventures that provide asset residual value guarantees in both domestic and foreign markets 
investments in to percent owned companies and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are shown as investments in affiliated companies 
certain investments in joint ventures that exceed ownership are not consolidated and are also accounted for using the equity method when gatx does not have effective or voting control of these legal entities and is not the primary beneficiary of the venture s activities 
the investments in affiliated companies are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for gatx s share of the affiliate s undistributed earnings 
distributions  which reflect both dividends and the return of principal  reduce the carrying amount of the investment 
pension and post retirement benefits assumptions gatx s pension and post retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
gatx evaluates these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and post retirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the guideline for establishing this rate is a high quality long term bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions 
income taxes gatx evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing the likelihood of whether deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforward benefits  will be realized in the future 
the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required involves judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives  if applicable 
taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the company has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely
