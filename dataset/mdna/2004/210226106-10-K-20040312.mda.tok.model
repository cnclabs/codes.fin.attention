the company lands are well located in the growing central florida interstate corridor providing an excellent opportunity for reasonably stable land sales in the near term future and following years 
with its substantial land holdings in daytona beach  the company has parcels available for the entire spectrum of real estate uses 
along with land sales  the company selectively develops parcels primarily for commercial uses

also in the fourth quarter  a acre sale for the second phase of the daytona beach auto mall was completed  along with lpga boulevard retail sites sold for a wendy s restaurant and a cvs pharmacy 
these transactions  all along the interstate and lpga boulevard corridor  compliment other new developments now under construction in the area including a new middle school  grand preserve residential community and a professional office park adjacent to the surgical and imaging facility 
sales closings and development activities tend to spur additional interest by prospective buyers and developers 
interest in company owned property remains strong with a backlog of contracts in place for closing in as closings occur  management intends to reinvest proceeds into income properties 
as the inventory of these income properties grows management will look to diversify through other real estate investments as opportunities arise
