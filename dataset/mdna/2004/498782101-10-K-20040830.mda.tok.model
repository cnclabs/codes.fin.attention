item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
basis of presentation when considering year over year growth statistics  it is important to keep in mind that fiscal contained weeks  compared to weeks in fiscal and overview knape vogt kv is a leading manufacturer of functional hardware  storage related components and ergonomic products with a long history dating back to we complement our manufacturing capabilities with our design and distribution expertise 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management further defined the business divisions into market channels and began making business decisions and reviewing financial information by market channel rather than by the previous home commercial products and office products divisions 
due to the complexity in obtaining this information for prior years  restatement of prior year results by market is impracticable and net sales for prior years are shown below segregated by divisions only 
the office products division was segregated into two market channels oem and dealer 
the oem market channel sells precision drawer slides  hardware and ergonomic products to original equipment office furniture manufacturers 
the dealer market channel sells ergonomic products to independent office furniture dealers 
these dealers purchase product from office furniture manufacturers and resell the furniture along with design and installation services to the end customer 
these markets sell the kv brand of hardware including drawer slides 
drawer slides include precision  euro style and utility slides 
precision drawer slides use ball bearings  while euro style and utility drawer slides use rollers 
in addition  these two markets also sell the idea work brand of ergonomic products 
the home commercial products division was segregated into two market channels consumer and distribution other 
the consumer market channel sells a majority of the company s product lines to retailers 
the distribution other market channel sells many of the company s product lines to kitchen and bath oem manufacturers and full line woodworking distributors 
these markets sell the kv brand of products that include a complete line of decorative and wall attached shelving systems  builders hardware and drawer slides 
in addition  these markets also sell the real solutions for real life brand of kitchen and bath storage products 
while net sales and earnings improved during fiscal  the company was challenged by a significant increase in steel costs during the last half of the fiscal year 
the company was able to successfully procure sufficient quantities of steel to prevent any interruption in production  however  the cost of raw steel increased over during this time period 
kv was able to partially offset these raw material increases through a combination of price increases and surcharges to many of its customers 
a more detailed discussion of this issue follows in the gross margin section of this report 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
based on our ongoing review  we will make adjustments  as we consider appropriate under the current facts and circumstances 
we believe that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts and any other form of sales incentive  including cooperative advertising and rebates 
in certain circumstances  the company does provide buyback programs and markdown allowances to its customers 
these amounts are fixed at the start of the contract period with the customer and accounted for in accordance with statement of position no 
 reporting on advertising costs and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
the cost of these programs are either expensed at the time of the initial shipment of the goods or are expensed on a prorated basis over the sales of the contract  if the company has a written commitment from the customer 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we record allowances for losses that we may incur from the inability of certain of our customers to pay for products or services that they have purchased 
in determining these allowances  we take into consideration the financial condition of our customers  previous payment history and the age of the outstanding balances 
we monitor customers balances on a monthly basis and assess the adequacy of the allowances recorded 
certain of the company s customers do have outstanding receivable balances that could have a material impact on the financial results in the event that those customers were unable to satisfy their obligations 
management  at this time  is not aware of any customers in this situation 
historically  the company has been able to effectively monitor the creditworthiness of its customers on a monthly basis and has not experienced a material loss 
inventory reserves we provide reserves for inventory that we consider obsolete or slow moving  utilizing assumptions about future demand for our products 
we monitor our inventory by type  age and usage on a monthly basis to determine the reserves recorded 
the majority of our products can be sold across various market channels 
therefore  we have been successful on a historic basis in minimizing our risk of slow moving or obsolete inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
this review is performed using estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
the most significant factor affecting our pension costs is the fair value of the plan assets and the selection of key assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
in fiscal  we increased our discount rate from from 
we maintained the expected return on plan assets at 
while we believe the assumptions selected are reasonable  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 
for example  a basis point change in the long term rate of return would change our expense by approximately  and a basis point change in the discount rate would change our expense by approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for our employee retirement plans 
loss contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business 
the company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical claims experience for incurred but not reported matters 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
the company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from multiple carriers 
these policies provide coverage that is utilized to minimize the impact  if any  of the legal proceedings 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to them in this management discussion and analysis 
in addition  we have not recently experienced changes in circumstances that would have significantly impacted our inventory reserves or our evaluation of the carrying value of the long lived assets 
further  in accordance with sfas no 
 paragraph  we have not had to test for recoverability of our long lived assets

consolidated net sales for fiscal increased when compared to fiscal  which followed a decline of when comparing fiscal to fiscal it should be noted that fiscal included weeks of sales versus weeks in both fiscal and excluding the extra week of sales  sales for fiscal would have increased approximately over fiscal our office products division sales increased when compared to fiscal  following a decline of in fiscal when compared to fiscal the office furniture industry shipments  as a whole  grew slightly during the eleven month period from july to may as seen in the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma results 
for this time period they reported an increase in shipments of and an increase in orders of 
this followed a decline in shipments of in fiscal the company has been successful in growing sales to the office product original equipment manufacturers oem s with the addition of new products  in particular the addition of a number of customer specific versions of kv s precision ball bearing slides and the new heavy duty precision slide with the patented interlock system 
the company also introduced new ergonomic products  including a new line of height adjustable tables  to both markets during the fiscal year 
our home and commercial products division sales for fiscal increased by when compared to fiscal  following a slight decline in fiscal when compared to fiscal new products  including the shelf made instant shelves  the new line of display ledges  the new line of garage organization products and the x pocket door heavy duty precision drawer slides  assisted in expanding sales to existing customers and obtaining new customers in both markets 
further  kv has seen growth in the distribution market where it made significant investments in the prior fiscal year 
in addition to ongoing cooperative advertising and rebate programs  certain introductory promotional incentives were offered during fiscal in the consumer market to a few customers to encourage them to either add new product lines to their offering or to add kv as a vendor 
these incentives reduced net sales and gross margins by approximately million in fiscal the company expenses these items at the initial shipment of product to the customer or pro rata based on sales volumes over the contract period  if the company has firm written purchase commitments from the customers 
unless new customers or significant new product lines are added during the upcoming fiscal year  management believes that these introductory promotional incentives will be significantly less in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we launched a consignment inventory program for certain customers 
under this program  the customers are not invoiced for product until the company receives notice that the customer has utilized the inventory at their location 
at july  and june   the total inventory in this program totaled and million at cost  respectively 
new product sales those products introduced within the last months were approximately million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal new product introductions  along with value added services  such as vendor managed inventory  remain key components of our strategy 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company began to realize increased steel costs for production of many of its products 
the increased steel costs resulted in the company paying approximately million more for raw steel during the last six months of the fiscal year than it would have if the steel prices had remained stable 
the uncertainty in the steel market makes it difficult for management to predict whether steel prices will continue to rise 
management has been able to quantify that a increase in raw steel prices will result in approximately a decrease in the company s gross margin  assuming the company is unable to pass these increased raw material costs on to its customers 
to date  the company has been successful in passing through approximately of the added costs to its customers 
kv has seen the steel market stabilize for the summer of  but early indicators  such as the price of scrap metal  are signaling potential increases in the fall 
the company has faced a competitive threat from asian producers of both utility and precision drawers slides 
kv has established solid vendor relationships with three key producers of these slides in asia and has been utilizing product sourced from these manufacturers to successfully address pricing pressures 
in addition  the company has taken preliminary steps to establish its own manufacturing entity in mainland china 
kv will be filing the necessary registrations for the entity and anticipates being in production in the early part of calendar the total initial investment is anticipated to be no more than million 
management believes that utilizing these low cost production resources will help it remain competitive in the us marketplace and will allow it to improve the profitability of its office products oem market 
domestically  the company remains committed to utilizing lean manufacturing initiatives to minimize its manufacturing costs 
to date  all of the slides produced in asia have represented incremental sales to kv and have not reduced volume being produced in the us in addition  kv is focusing its domestic production capabilities on manufacturing the new products  which typically represent higher margin items 
the decline in gross margins when comparing fiscal to fiscal reflects the fact that kv has a significant investment in its manufacturing process  specifically machinery and tooling 
with the decrease in sales volumes during fiscal  it was more difficult to effectively leverage the fixed portion of these costs 
in addition  kv was negatively impacted by increases in raw steel costs  ranging from to depending on the grade of steel  as a result of the statutory steel tariffs 
these tariffs were removed in fiscal  but as noted steel prices still increased during the last six months of fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  kv was successful in leveraging its selling and administrative costs as sales volumes grew  while still making certain that spending was sufficient to ensure its ongoing ability to develop and introduce new products to the market and have the appropriate advertising materials available to introduce those products 
the prior year results reflected additional marketing to reintroduce its line of kitchen and bath accessories under the real solutions for real life logo  investments in selling efforts to the distribution channel and the cost to convert from independent third party representatives to a direct sales force 
fiscal also included a pre tax gain of million due to the successful resolution of certain legal matters 
impairment and severance costs during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  pre tax of severance costs  primarily related to the resignation of two of our executive officers in august in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
for certain precision drawer slide tooling 
while we continue to produce the drawer slides  the future cash flows associated with the sales of this particular product line were less than the cost of the tooling recorded 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted a plan to reduce our salaried workforce in the grand rapids  michigan facility 
we recorded  pre tax in severance costs for this workforce reduction 
interest expense and other net expenses interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal years and overall  interest expense has remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years 
slight variations reflect the impact of higher or lower balances outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
net other expense was  in fiscal  compared to net other income of  and  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal fiscal included exchange rate losses in our canadian entity and royalty income  received on certain patent settlements  that was significantly less than it had been in the two previous fiscal years 
in addition  fiscal included interest of approximately  received related to refunds from the internal revenue service 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the company benefited from the adjustment of certain deferred tax valuation reserves that were deemed to no longer be necessary and from the completion of a canadian audit of taxes for fiscal years and excluding these items  the effective rate would have been approximately for the fiscal year 
during fiscal  kv amended its income tax returns previously filed for fiscal years and a change in the federal tax law allowed it to utilize a portion of its capital loss from fiscal years and that had been previously disallowed 
as a result of this change  kv recognized an income tax benefit of  in fiscal excluding the impact of the amended returns  the effective tax rate would have been in fiscal overall  rates have increased due to the ratio of foreign versus domestic income and expanded state exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal improved sales volumes  along with better leveraging of selling and administrative expenses  were the primary contributors to the net income improvement in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to 
million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has invested approximately million in inventory during fiscal to support the launch of certain new products 
following the initial launch period for these products  management will be able to reduce this level of cash invested in inventory and accordingly  expects the inventory balances to be lower in fiscal in addition  the increased sales volume resulted in a million increase in accounts receivable 
the lower cash flow from operating activities in fiscal reflects lower earnings  a significant contribution to our defined benefit pension plans  and higher inventory levels needed to support the launch of the new products and the consignment inventory program 
in addition  the payment of the legal settlements during fiscal also reduced the cash generated by operating activities 
cash flows used for investing activities cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the capital expenditures in fiscal represented investments in tooling for new products  including certain new custom precision slides 
there were no significant capital expenditure commitments at july  the fiscal capital expenditures represented investments in tooling for new products  including the hopper and certain precision drawer slides  along with investment in our web based customer service application and our new office showroom in chicago 
capital spending declined in fiscal and  due to the fact that we believe that our investments made in earlier years in the manufacturing process have been sufficient to meet the anticipated capacity needs for at least the next three to five years 
we believe that capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal  as investments will be focused on bringing new products and product enhancements to our customers 
the cost to complete the items classified as construction in progress at july  was estimated to be approximately  which will be derived from cash flows from operations or from the revolving credit facility 
cash flows provided by used for financing activities cash flows utilized for financing activities were million in fiscal  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal  and million of cash flow used in fiscal the use of funds in fiscal reflected the ongoing costs of the company s dividend program  which were only partially offset by 
million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the generation of funds in fiscal reflects borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the use of funds in fiscal reflects the repayment of million of debt under the revolving credit facility along with the repurchase of million of our common stock 
kv has a stock repurchase program  under which it purchased no shares in fiscal and  shares during fiscal with the price per share ranging from approximately to at july   kv is authorized to repurchase an additional  shares 
on august   the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility that matures on november  the new three year revolving credit facility is unsecured and replaces a million credit facility that would have expired in interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are either based on the london interbank offering rate libor  plus a negotiated spread over libor  or at the us prime rate 
the new agreement requires the company to pay a non use fee on amounts not outstanding under the credit facility based on a ratio of the company s adjusted total debt funded debt less cash and cash equivalents to ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  kv has an interest rate swap agreement  which expires on june   in order to fix the interest rate on million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the swap agreement fixed the rate at plus our credit spread on the revolving credit agreement 
at july   kv was in compliance with all of the covenants of the revolving credit agreement 
the outstanding debt at july  was million  compared to million at fiscal year end 
the debt to total capital ratio improved to at july   from at june  note that kv defines total capital as the sum of long term debt plus total stockholders equity 
management continues to manage the company s debt levels in an effort to maintain its debt to total capital in a range of to 
anticipated cash flows from operations and available balances on the revolving credit line are expected to be adequate to fund working capital  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal legal contingencies the canada customs and revenue agency ccra has performed an audit of the company s sales to its wholly owned subsidiary  knape vogt canada 
preliminary results from a joint review by the company and its customs broker indicate that the company may be liable for certain customs transactions  however  the amount of any such potential liability is unknown at this time 
the company is defending its position that knape vogt canada is the importer of record for all knape vogt goods shipped into canada and management believes that based on the information available at this time  any liability owed to the ccra will not have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
the company was sued in the kent county  michigan circuit court in by a former employee seeking additional benefits under an executive retirement plan 
the circuit court ruled in favor of the plaintiff  but in june  the circuit court was reversed on the company s appeal to the michigan court of appeals 
a delayed request for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court which the plaintiff filed was denied during the fourth quarter of fiscal in august  the plaintiff filed a lawsuit seeking these retirement benefits in the federal district court for the western district of michigan 
the company moved to dismiss the federal litigation based on the statute of limitations 
in september  the federal district court dismissed the litigation 
in october  the plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the sixth circuit court of appeals 
that appeal is pending 
management believes that any liability resulting from this case will not have a material adverse affect on the company s earnings 
we are also subject to other legal proceedings and claims  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  based on the information presently known and taking into account established accruals of approximately  at july   the ultimate liability for these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of our operations

the agreements to which we are a party that fall into this category include certain royalty agreements under which we pay a royalty based on the sales volume of certain products that we manufacture and sell 
inflation inflation  excluding the increase in steel discussed in the gross margin section of this report  has not had a significant effect on kv over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant effect in the foreseeable future 
kv continuously attempts to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity
