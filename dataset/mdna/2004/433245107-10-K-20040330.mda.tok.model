this discussion contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties are discussed at cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and under the heading forward looking statements and factors that may affect our future results in this annual report on form k

discontinued operations in march  we completed the sale of sun gro horticulture  which we refer to as sun gro  to a newly established canadian income fund 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale  which includes the tax refunds from the canadian customs revenue authority ccra recorded in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of  the majority of which were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of the sale of sun gro  we no longer harvest or produce peat moss or other growing soil mixes 
our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of sun gro as discontinued operations 
united states tax matters as a result of our business activities  we qualify for a special exception under the us federal tax code that allows us to use the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes 
under the cash method  sales are included in taxable income when payments are received and expenses are deducted as they are paid 
we derive significant tax benefits by being able to deduct the cost of inventory as the cost is incurred 
as a result of our ability to utilize the cash method of accounting  we have historically generated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes and have not been required to pay cash income taxes 
at december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
based on our current projections  we anticipate that we will incur tax liability and begin paying cash income taxes for federal purposes in we are currently paying cash income taxes for state income tax purposes in certain states due to the differing rules regarding the utilization of net operating losses 
although the use of the cash method of accounting for federal income taxes defers the payment of federal income taxes  the deferral of such taxes produces a current liability for accounting purposes 
at december   we had a current deferred liability for deferred income taxes of million 
the liability is deemed current for accounting purposes because the majority of the items to which this liability relates are comprised of current assets and current liabilities in our balance sheet such as inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the classification of this liability as a current item  however  does not mean that it is required to be paid within the next twelve months 
canadian tax matters in connection with the sale of sun gro  the ccra required that approximately million canadian of the gross proceeds from the transaction be withheld in an escrow account pending the determination of whether certain aspects of the sale were taxable for canadian purposes 
the proceeds withheld were not included in the initial measurement of the loss on the sale of sun gro 
on november   we filed a tax return  submitted a tax payment of million canadian from the escrow funds and submitted a claim for refund on the basis that the transaction is exempt from tax for canadian purposes 
the balance of the escrow funds of million canadian us million was then remitted to us and was recorded in the fourth quarter of as an adjustment to the loss on the sale of sun gro 
on september   the ccra completed its assessment of our tax return in which it determined that the transaction was exempt from tax for canadian purposes and issued a refund to us of all tax paid  plus accrued interest 
we received the refund check of million canadian us million on october  and recorded it in the third quarter of as an adjustment to the loss on the sale of sun gro 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal 
the seasonal nature of our operations results in a significant increase in our working capital between the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities in the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities in the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as we ship inventory and collect accounts receivable 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant variability in net sales  operating income and net income on a quarterly basis 
recent developments on march   two california nurseries  which we do not own or operate  tested positive for sudden oak death sod  also referred to as phytophthora 
ramorum p 
ramorum 
as a result of these findings  certain states declared a quarantine on all plant material coming from california and several others imposed a quarantine on sod host and associated host plants only 
on march   we took the precautionary measure of voluntarily suspending the shipment of all sod host and associated host plants grown in our california facilities pending the results of the joint california department of food agriculture cdfa and us department of agriculture usda testing of our facilities 
on march   we were notified by the cdfa that all of our california growing facilities had tested negative for p 
ramorum and  as a result  the cdfa and the usda subsequently issued compliance agreements to our fallbrook and irvine facilities  allowing us to ship host and associated host plants 
for additional information concerning sod  see risks related to our business 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from net sales of million in the increase was driven primarily by strong sales of patio ready type products due to improved market penetration in the midwest and northeast markets  increased sales of bedding plants in the south  and expanded sales of shrubs and perennials in the rocky mountain and midwest markets 
these increases were partially offset by the soft retail environment we experienced during the first quarter of and sluggish sales during the first six months of the year in the midwest and northeast resulting from cold  wet weather that persisted late into spring 
sales were also down for bedding plants in colorado and the southwest during the period  primarily due to overcapacity in the market 
gross profit 
gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from gross profit of million in due mainly to higher sales as discussed above 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit in remained unchanged at from better inventory management through our store service programs and certain changes in product mix improved our gross margins throughout the year 
however  during the second half of the year  increased scrap rates for bedding plants and the need for selective price discounting countered any increase in year over year gross margins 
selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase was due mainly to higher sales and higher distribution costs 
distribution costs increased by million  or  from as a result of higher fuel prices and escalating common carrier costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily due to our efforts to control costs  improve efficiencies  and a reduction in salary expense that resulted from the management changes that took place in late and early  as discussed below 
other operating loss income and severance costs 
other operating expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  primarily represents severances costs associated with the resignation of our former chief executive officer in february of of million and the elimination of certain other positions during the year of million 
other operating income of million for the fiscal year ended december  primarily represents the net gain from the sale of our property in hillsboro  oregon during the first quarter of operating income

as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to from 
other expenses 
other expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase was mainly due to the million loss on debt extinguishment during the third quarter 
this loss was partially offset by the impact of the mark to market adjustment on our interest rate swap and lower interest expense during financing costs for included income of million relating to the fair value adjustment of the interest rate swap agreement compared with a loss of million in interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  decreased by million from income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was  unchanged from income from continuing operations

income loss from discontinued operations

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million for the fiscal year ended december  represents the goodwill impairment charge  net of tax  resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
we valued both the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of january  the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the book value goodwill led to a pre tax charge of million 
a million tax benefit was recorded in connection with the charge 
our measurement of the fair value of the goodwill was based on the market capitalization of our common stock over a reasonable period of time  including a control premium 
accordingly  the primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the overall deterioration in our stock price and our substantial leverage 
there was no comparable charge in fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from net sales of million in the increase was due primarily to increased sales volume resulting from strong sales generated by our west coast operations  successful in store service programs in the northeast markets and strong sales of perennials 
sales generated by our west coast operations were strong because of product line changes  while increased sales in the northeast were driven by the expansion of successful in store service programs 
these programs enable us to offer a broader selection of green goods and streamline ordering and in store merchandising activities with our customers 
this was somewhat offset by sluggish sales in arizona  texas and the southeast  which resulted primarily from overcapacity of green goods in the market 
in addition  given kmart s uncertain financial situation  we reduced our sales to the large retailer for the fiscal year ended december  by approximately million from the previous year 
gross profit 
gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross margins decreased to from mainly due to the lower sales in our southeast markets  which typically carry higher margins  and increased scrap rates primarily related to the lower kmart sales and higher unit production costs in the nursery operations 
selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the higher sales  additional sales and merchandising personnel and higher distribution costs 
distribution costs increased by million  or  from due mainly to our transition to a unitized delivery mode for many of our nursery products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the change was due mainly to an increase in bad debt expense relating to the kmart pre chapter receivable  higher costs associated with our continued implementation of our oracle system and severance costs associated with the elimination of certain administrative positions somewhat offset by the reduction in salary costs related to the elimination of these positions 
other operating income 
other operating income of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase was primarily due to the net gain from the sale of our property in hillsboro  oregon and the gain on sale of fixed assets  partially offset by the write off of software we no longer use 
amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization for the fiscal year ended december  of decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was entirely due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
operating income 
operating income of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to from 
the decrease was due mainly to the lower gross margins and higher selling and distribution costs discussed above and was offset by ceasing the amortization of goodwill in under the provisions of sfas no 
other expenses 
other expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expenses and a fair value charge of million relating to our million interest rate swap agreement as compared to a charge of million for this adjustment results from the quarterly change in the swap s valuation  which is based on long term interest rate expectations 
other expenses include interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in resulted from using the net proceeds from the sale of the sun gro business and the sale of the oregon land to reduce debt 
income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in the effective income tax rate from to was due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the increase was mainly due to lower other expenses  the net gain from the sale of the oregon land recorded as other operating income and our ceasing the amortization of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 as discussed above 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for the fiscal year ended december  includes a loss of million  net of tax  from the sale of the sun gro business and a gain of million from the operations of sun gro through the date of sale 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for the fiscal year ended december  is comprised entirely of a loss from the operations of sun gro 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million for the fiscal year ended december  represents the goodwill impairment charge  net of tax  resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
we valued both the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of january  the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the book value goodwill led to a pre tax charge of million 
a million tax benefit was recorded in connection with the charge 
our measurement of the fair value of the goodwill was based on the market capitalization of our common stock over a reasonable period of time  including a control premium 
accordingly  the primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the overall deterioration in our stock price and our substantial leverage 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the seasonal nature of our operations results in a significant fluctuation in certain components of working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory during the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities during the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities for the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as we ship inventory and collect accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for mainly due to larger increases in working capital in compared to the increase in working capital was primarily related to a lower level of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and interest at december  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in accounts payable during was impacted by the cost management initiatives undertaken during the year and the reorganization that took place in late and early the lower level of accrued interest at december  resulted mainly from the refinancing  which required payment of all accrued interest relating to our old credit facility and previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the increase in working capital was also affected to a lesser degree by an increase in prepaid expenses during compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the decrease was mainly due to the impact of certain events during the first quarter of  which primarily included the proceeds received from the sale of sun gro and the sale of the minter bridge property in oregon of million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to capital expenditures of million in the capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended december  primarily included the purchase of nursery related machinery and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the improvement was primarily related to the impact of the refinancing during the third quarter of and the impact of certain items during the first quarter of as part of the refinancing during the third quarter of  proceeds from the issuance of new debt helped to offset the repayments of existing debt  the payment of deferred financing fees and the early redemption premium on the senior subordinated notes 
the first quarter of was impacted by the use of the proceeds from the sale of sun gro and the sale of the oregon property to pay down existing bank debt and to pay deferred financing costs 
we typically draw down our revolving credit facilities in the first and fourth quarters to fund our seasonal inventory buildup and seasonal operating expenses 
approximately of our sales occur in the first half of the year  generally allowing us to reduce borrowing under our revolving credit facilities in the second and third quarters 
on december   we had million of borrowings under our new working capital revolver  resulting in unused borrowing capacity of million after applying the borrowing base limitations to our available borrowings 
at december   we had total indebtedness outstanding of million 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing or any financial arrangements with related parties  other than operating leases 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years in millions new term loan revolving facility senior notes other obligations operating leases total we believe that cash generated by operations and from borrowings expected to be available under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following areas represent our most critical accounting policies related to actual results that may vary from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
sales returns and allowances 
amounts accrued for sales returns and allowance are maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the trade receivable due to sales discounts and allowances 
the provision rate is established by management using the following criteria past sales returns experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the rate is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions for sales discounts and allowances charged against income increase the allowance 
we record revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when the risk of ownership is transferred to the customer 
allowances are provided at the time revenue is recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level believed by management to adequately reflect the probable losses in the trade receivable due to customer defaults  insolvencies or bankruptcies 
the provision is established by management using the following criteria customer credit history  customer current credit rating and other relevant factors 
the provision is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions to bad debt expense charged against income increase the allowance 
all recoveries on trade receivables previously charged off are credited to the accounts receivable recovery account charged against income  while direct charge offs of trade receivables are deducted from the allowance 
accounting for goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this standard  goodwill has been classified as indefinite lived assets no longer subject to amortization 
indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment testing upon adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this involves a two step process 
first  we must determine if the carrying amount of equity exceeds the fair value based upon the quoted market price of our common stock 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
the initial impairment analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
we have recognized this impairment charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
accrued liabilities 
accrued liabilities include amounts accrued for expected claims costs relating to our insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liability 
we have large deductibles for these lines of insurance  which means we must pay the portion of each claim that falls below the deductible amount 
our expected claims costs are based on an actuarial analysis that considers our current payroll and automobile profile  recent claims history  insurance industry loss development factors and the deductible amounts 
we accrue our expected claims costs for each year on a ratable monthly basis with a corresponding charge against income 
management reviews the adequacy of the accruals at the end of each quarter 
the accruals for the expected costs relating to our insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liability are maintained at levels believed by our management to adequately reflect our probable claims obligations

new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and to determine when and which business enterprise primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb revised fin fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the revised provisions are applicable no later than the first reporting period ending after march  we do not believe that the adoption of fin and fin r will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation management believes the company s results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation over the past three years 
forward looking statements and factors that may affect our future results we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  forms k and q and in other contexts relating to our future prospects  our operations and our strategies 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic performance and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  forms k and q and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals and our operations are subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
the following factors that may affect our future results should not be considered a definitive list of all risks associated with our operations and should be read in conjunction with the risks and uncertainties contained in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our capital structure we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding  which could hurt our future prospects and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt outstanding of million 
this debt may have several important consequences for the holders of the notes 
as it could o make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  including making scheduled interest payments under the notes and other debt obligations  o limit our ability to obtain additional financing  o increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and commercial nursery industry conditions  including changes in interest rates  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the commercial nursery industry  and o place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
if we incur additional debt  the risks related to our substantial amount of debt could increase 
in the future  we may be able to incur substantially more debt  subject to certain covenants contained in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our notes 
our senior credit facility permits additional borrowings and all of those borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and are effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees to the extent of the value of the collateral 
if we incur new debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
the terms of our debt may limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing the notes issued by hines nurseries contain covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things o incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock  o pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  o create liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets  o make investments  loans or advances  o make capital expenditures  o issue  sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries  o enter into sale and leaseback transactions  o prepay or defease specified debt  o enter into transactions with affiliates  o enter into specified hedging arrangements  o merge  consolidate or sell our assets  or o engage in any business other than the commercial nursery business 
these covenants may affect our ability to operate our business  may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business 
a breach of a covenant in our debt instruments could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
repayment of the principal of the notes and our other debt may require additional financing 
we are not certain of the source or availability of any such financing at this time 
our anticipated operating cash flows will not be sufficient to repay the principal of the notes and our other debt 
accordingly  in order to pay the principal of the notes and our other debt  we will be required to refinance our debt  sell our equity securities  sell our assets or take other actions 
the foregoing actions may not enable us to pay the principal of the notes or such other debt or may not be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments then in effect 
risks related to our business our production of plants may be adversely affected by a number of agricultural factors beyond our control 
our production of plants may be adversely affected by a number of agricultural risks  including disease  pests  freezing conditions  snow  drought or other inclement weather  and improper use of pesticides or herbicides 
these factors could cause production difficulties which could damage or reduce our inventory  resulting in sales  profit and operating cash flow declines  which could be material 
increases in water prices or insufficient availability of water could adversely affect our plant production  resulting in reduced sales and profitability 
plant production depends upon the availability of water 
our nurseries receive their water from a variety of sources  including on site wells  creeks  reservoirs and holding ponds  municipal water districts and irrigation water supplied to local districts by facilities owned and operated by the united states acting through the department of interior bureau of reclamation 
the loss or reduction of access to water at any of our nurseries could have a material adverse effect on our business  results from operations and operating cash flows 
in addition  increases in our costs for water could adversely impact our profitability and operating cash flows 
our nursery in arizona receives its water from on site wells 
under arizona s groundwater management act  these wells have been issued grandfathered non irrigation water permits  which limit the amount of groundwater we can use 
the availability of water depends on the groundwater aquifer  which at this time  we believe is adequate to supply our needs for this nursery as it is currently operated 
our northern california and oregon nurseries rely primarily on surface water supplies and  therefore  may experience fluctuations in available water supplies and serious reductions in their supplies of surface water in the event of prolonged droughts 
if such reductions occur  those nurseries would have to rely on backup water supplies which are more costly than surface water supplies 
the use and price of water supplied by facilities owned and operated by the bureau of reclamation  including availability of subsidized water rates  is governed by federal reclamation laws and regulations 
such water is used at our northern california nursery and is the source of a substantial majority of the water for our oregon nursery 
while we believe we are in material compliance with applicable regulations and maintain a compliance program  there can be no assurance that changes in law will not reduce availability or increase the price of reclamation water to us 
any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and operating cash flows 
the reclamation regulations govern who may hold an interest in irrigation lands 
under the reclamation regulations  persons having a direct or indirect beneficial economic interest in us will be treated as indirect holders of irrigation land owned by us in proportion to their beneficial interest in us 
if any holder of our common stock whether directly or indirectly through a broker dealer or otherwise is ineligible under applicable reclamation regulations to hold an indirect interest in our irrigation land  we may not be eligible to receive reclamation water on this land 
generally  the eligibility requirement of the reclamation regulations would be satisfied by a person o who is a citizen of the united states or an entity established under federal or state law or a person who is a citizen of or an entity established under the laws of certain foreign countries including canada and mexico and members of the organization for economic cooperation and development  and o whose ownership  direct and indirect  of other land which is qualified to receive water from a reclamation project  when added to such person s attributed indirect ownership of irrigation land owned by us  does not exceed certain maximum acreage limitations generally  acres for individuals and acres for entities 
while our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions intended to prohibit ineligible holders of irrigation land from owning our common stock  such provisions may not be effective in protecting our right to continue to use reclamation water 
we face risks associated with sudden oak death 
quarantines of our products by federal and state regulatory authorities in response to sudden oak death could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
sod is caused by a fungus like pathogen recently identified by scientists in california and named p 
ramorum 
since its appearance in  p 
ramorum has killed thousands of coast live oak  black oak  tanoak and shreve oak in northern california 
p 
ramorum can also infect the leaves and branches of other plants referred to as sod host plants 
currently  fifty nine plant varieties grown by commercial nurseries have been identified as sod hosts 
in february  as part of the sod national nursery survey  the usda encouraged all states to conduct a survey of nurseries that ship sod host plants interstate 
accordingly  the cdfa and the usda conducted joint tests at nurseries located throughout california  which tests included our irvine  vacaville  winters  and fallbrook facilities 
on march   two nurseries  which we do not own or operate  tested positive for p 
ramorum 
as a result of these findings certain states declared a quarantine on all plant material coming from california and several others imposed a quarantine on sod host and associated host plants only 
we grow out of the fifty nine species known to be sod host and associated host plants as specified by the california department of agriculture 
on march   we took the precautionary measure of voluntarily suspending the shipment of all sod host plants grown in our california facilities pending the results of the joint cdfa and usda testing of our facilities 
on march   we were notified by the cdfa that all of our california growing facilities had tested negative for p 
ramorum 
as a result of these findings  the cdfa and the usda issued compliance agreements with our fallbrook and irvine facilities  allowing us to ship host and associated host plants  if we meet  and continue to meet  certain inspection requirements 
our northern california facilities  vacaville and winters  have been located in a p 
ramorum regulated county and have continued to operate under the terms of a previous compliance agreement with the cdfa and usda 
their compliance agreement requires that potential sod host plants be inspected and tested monthly during the growing season for the presence of p 
ramorum 
to date  our two northern facilities have tested as sod free places of production on march   the usda s animal and plant health inspection service announced that it will now regulate the interstate movement of sod host and associated host plants from all california nurseries 
this new measure prohibits an estimated  california nurseries from shipping plants susceptible to p 
ramorum until those nurseries can be inspected and are found to be free of the pathogen 
the usda will also launch a national survey to determine if p 
ramorum is causing disease symptoms on hosts and associated hosts in other parts of the country 
we believe that all states will honor the usda s decision to regulate this situation and will now allow us to resume interstate shipping of all plant material from california  with the exception of sod host plants  which will be subject to the terms of our compliance agreements 
all of our california nurseries have tested negative for p 
ramorum 
however  if in the future we do test positive for p 
ramorum  our products could be subject to quarantine by federal and state regulatory authorities 
if this were to occur  we could experience a significant loss of sales and may be required to write off inventory  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results from operations  and operating cash flows 
regulatory authorities could also enact restrictive regulations on soil media containing redwood sawdust  a known carrier of p 
ramorum  requiring us to modify our current growing procedures as well as develop alternatives to using it 
if these restrictions are enacted  we may be unable to successfully develop a cost effective alternative to using redwood sawdust  which could also adversely affect our business  results of operations and operating cash flows 
because our business is highly seasonal  our revenues  cash flows from operations and operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
our business is highly seasonal 
the seasonal nature of our operations results in a significant increase in our working capital during the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities during the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities for the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as we ship inventory and collect accounts receivable 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant variability in net sales  operating cash flows and net income on a quarterly basis 
one significant factor contributing to this variability is weather  particularly on weekends during the peak gardening season in the second quarter 
unfavorable weather conditions during the peak gardening season could have a material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows from operations and operating income 
other factors that may contribute to this variability include o shifts in demand for live plant products  o changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  o period to period changes in holidays  o the economic stability of our retail customers  and o our relationship with each of our retail customers 
because we depend on a core group of significant customers  our sales  cash flows from operations and results of operations may be negatively affected if our key customers reduce the amount of products they purchase from us 
our top ten customers together accounted for approximately of our net sales in our largest customer  the home depot  accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our retail customers  and they may not continue to purchase our products 
the loss of  or a significant adverse change in  our relationship with the home depot or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on us 
the loss of  or a reduction in orders from  any significant retail customers  losses arising from retail customers disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major retail customer could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  revenue from customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  may not continue  or if continued  may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period 
we face intense competition  and our inability to compete effectively for any reason could adversely affect our business 
our competition varies by region  each of which is highly competitive 
although many of our largest customers are national retailers  buying decisions are generally made locally by our customers 
we compete primarily on the basis of breadth of product mix  consistency of product quality  product availability  customer service and price 
we generally face competition from several local companies and usually from one or two regional companies in each of our current markets 
competition in our existing markets may also increase considerably in the future 
some of our competitors may have greater market share in a particular region or market  less debt  greater pricing flexibility or superior marketing or financial resources 
increased competition could result in lower profit margins  substantial pricing pressure  reduced market share and lower operating cash flows 
price competition  together with other forms of competition  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and operating cash flows 
our nursery facility in irvine  california is entirely on leased land and we do not expect the leases to be extended beyond their current terms 
our acre nursery facility and headquarters in irvine  california are entirely on leased land 
we recently entered into an amended lease agreement for this facility in which new acres were added and the lease expiration schedule was changed 
under the amended lease agreement  the lease on acres expires on june   the lease on acres expires on december   and the lease on the remaining acres expires on december  we do not expect these leases to be extended beyond their current terms 
for the acres that will expire in  we are developing plans to transition a majority of the production to our allendale  california facility and the remaining production to the parcel recently added to our facility in irvine 
for the acres that will expire at the end of  we will be required to establish new production facilities or transition production to existing facilities 
we may incur substantial costs in connection with the establishment of these new production facilities or the transition of production to existing facilities 
we may not be successful in executing our transition plan or establishing suitable replacement production facilities 
if we are unsuccessful in these efforts  our net sales  cash flows and operating income could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  when we vacate acres in  we currently estimate that we will incur approximately  of removal and remediation costs 
we may incur significant expenses beyond what we have forecasted if additional remedial action is required 
significant costs in excess of our estimates could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern  and impose liability  for our activities and operations 
if we do not comply with these laws and regulations  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern  and impose liability for  our activities and operations which may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for hazardous substances and other wastes 
some of our nursery operations are conducted near residential developments  which could increase our exposure to liability for the environmental effects of our operations 
our operations have resulted  or may result  in noncompliance with or liability for cleanup under these laws 
in addition  the presence of hazardous substances on our properties  or the failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or operate our properties or to borrow using them as collateral 
in some cases  our liability may not be limited to the value of the property or its improvements 
we cannot assure you that these matters  or any similar matters that may arise in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on us 
certain of our operations and activities  such as water runoff from our production facilities and the use of certain pesticides  are subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency and similar state and local agencies 
these agencies may regulate or prohibit the use of such products  procedures or operations  thereby affecting our operations and profitability 
in addition  we must comply with a broad range of environmental laws and regulations 
additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations may be enacted in the future and such changes could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to federal and state fair trade laws and weights and measures regulations that govern and impose liability for improperly marketing  labeling or advertising plant container size 
if we do not comply with these laws and regulations  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to federal and state weights and measures regulations that govern and impose liability for improperly labeling or advertising our plant container sizes 
it is common in our industry  at the wholesale and retail levels  to market  label  and advertise container grown nursery stock with varying types of measurements  such as imperial volume or diameter of container 
these measurements  although consistent with industry practice  may not represent the exact size of the actual product 
if the federal trade commission or any state regulator determines that our current marketing  labeling  or advertising is in violation of fair trade laws or weights and measures regulations in their jurisdiction  we may incur significant costs to become compliant  be forced to terminate further shipments of inventory into certain jurisdictions  be fined  or otherwise suffer a material adverse affect on our business 
changes in local zoning laws may adversely affect our business 
we are subject to local zoning laws regulating the use of our owned and leased property 
some of our facilities are located in areas experiencing rapid development and growth  which typically are characterized by changes in existing zoning 
changes in local zoning laws could require us to establish new production facilities or transition production to other facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position and results of operations 
compliance with  and changes to labor laws  particularly those concerning seasonal workers  could significantly increase our costs 
the production of our plants is labor intensive 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act as well as various federal  state and local regulations that govern matters such as minimum wage requirements  overtime and working conditions  including  but not limited  to federal and state health and worker safety rules and regulations 
a large number of our seasonal employees are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage level and  accordingly  changes in minimum wage laws could materially increase our costs 
non us nationals comprise a large portion of our seasonal employee workforce and changes to us immigration policies that restrict the ability of immigrant workers to obtain employment in the united states and which may contribute to shortages of available seasonal labor could increase our costs 
non compliance with applicable regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance  require a termination of certain activities  result in fines or loss of a portion of our labor force or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our transportation costs are significant and we depend on independent contractors for trucking services to ship large quantities of our products and increases in transportation costs  changes in available trucking capacity and other changes affecting such carriers  as well as interruptions in service or work stoppages  could adversely impact our results of operations 
we rely extensively on the services of agents and independent contractors to provide trucking services to us 
transportation costs accounted for approximately of our net sales in our ability to ship our products  particularly during our peak shipping seasons  could be adversely impacted by shortages in available trucking capacity  changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices  such as scheduling  pricing  payment terms and frequency of service  or increases in the cost of fuel  taxes and labor  and other factors not within our control 
we compete with other companies who ship perishable goods for available trucking capacity and  accordingly  reductions in capacity or shortages of the agents and independent contractors who provide trucking services to us could potentially adversely impact our sales 
significant increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  particularly if we are not able to pass on such price increases to our customers in the form of higher prices for our products 
material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation  whether caused by strike or otherwise  could adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial position and operating cash flows 
we are currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning software program  and unexpected delays  expenses or disruptions in the implementation of such software program could disrupt our business or impair our ability to monitor our operations  resulting in a negative impact on our operations  financial position and operating cash flows 
in four of our nurseries we have implemented a new enterprise resource planning software program which we utilize for production planning and inventory purposes 
over time  we intend to continue the implementation of this software program to our other nursery facilities 
our distribution and sales order system  however  remains on our prior computer information systems 
we may experience delays  disruptions and unanticipated expenses in implementing  integrating and operating our management information and reporting systems  which could disrupt our operations or otherwise impair our ability to monitor our operations and have a negative impact on our business  results of operations  financial position and operating cash flows 
our research and development efforts may not be successful 
our success is based  in part  upon our ability to discover and develop new products that customers will want 
as a result  we continue to invest in research and development in order to enable us to identify and develop new products to meet consumer demands 
despite investments in this area  our research and development may not result in the discovery or successful development of new products which will be accepted by our customers 
our current principal stockholders have significant influence over our business and could delay  deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination 
investment partnerships controlled by madison dearborn partners  inc beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock of hines horticulture and have sufficient voting power to control  or at the least significantly influence  the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
in addition  madison dearborn partners has two of its designees on hines horticulture s six member board of directors 
our business will suffer if certain senior executives discontinue employment with us or if we are unable to recruit and retain highly skilled staff 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management  including robert a 
ferguson president and chief executive officer and claudia m 
pieropan chief financial officer  secretary and treasurer 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any members of management 
no members of senior management are bound by non compete agreements  and if any such members were to depart and subsequently compete with us  such competition could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business also depends on our ability to continue to recruit  train and retain skilled employees  particularly skilled growers and sales personnel 
the loss of the services of any key personnel  or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills  could impair our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products  sell products to our customers or manage our business effectively 
price increases of certain raw materials could adversely affect our business 
we and our competitors are vulnerable to price increases for raw materials 
for  raw material costs accounted for approximately of net sales 
we do not have long term contracts with the majority of our raw material suppliers 
increases in the cost of raw materials essential to our operations  including seed  plastic  chemicals and fertilizer  would increase our costs of production 
significant increases in the price of petrochemicals or a scarcity of raw materials essential to plant propagation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to pass such price increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices for our products  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and prospects may be harmed 
our success depends in part on proprietary techniques and plant designs 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary property and processes through a combination of patents  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements  these may be insufficient 
litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of competitors 
intellectual property litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management and other resources 
if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors could be able to market products that compete with our proprietary products without obtaining a license from us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and hines horticulture s common stock price 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
we have various debt instruments outstanding at december  that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on variable rate debt  we entered into the interest rate swap agreement described below to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate obligations 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge million of debt 
the interest rate swap agreement effectively changes our exposure on the variable rate interest payments to fixed rate interest payments based on the month libor rate in effect at the beginning of each quarterly period 
the estimated fair value of our obligation under the interest rate swap agreement was million at december  the interest rate swap agreement remains outstanding and matures in february we also manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our debt was million and million  respectively 
given the current balance of our fixed rate and variable rate debt  we estimate a change in interest costs of less than million for every one percentage point change in applicable interest rates 
without considering the fixed interest rate provided by our swap agreement  which expires at the end of february of  we estimate a change in interest costs of approximately million for every one percentage point change in applicable interest rates
