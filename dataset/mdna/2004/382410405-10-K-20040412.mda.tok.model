table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was created by the combination of patrick petroleum company patrick and la cal energy partners  a partnership in which it had a controlling interest la cal  in august the combination was a reverse merger in which the company s current management gained control of the combined company  renamed it goodrich petroleum corporation and assumed patrick s new york stock exchange listing 
the company seeks to increase shareholder value by growing its oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in the company s opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production  on a cost effective basis  are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company such as goodrich 
management strives to increase the company s oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through a balanced program of capital expenditures involving acquisition  exploitation and exploration activities 
the company generally does not make capital commitments beyond one year 
goodrich develops an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by its board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
the company takes into consideration its projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing its capital expenditure budget 
the company places primary emphasis on its internally generated operating cash flow in managing its business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in the company s statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of its financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income 
the company s revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of its inventory of capital projects  the volume and timing of its production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond the company s control  however  goodrich employs commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on its earnings and operating cash flow 
as further described under results of operations below  the company achieved significant increases in oil and gas production volumes and operating cash flows in the year ended december  these trends largely reflect the results of goodrich s successful drilling program as the company increased its capital expenditures in to approximately of the level 
additionally  the company benefited from a strong commodity pricing environment in

subject to current economics and financial resources  the company expects to finance its capital expenditures out of operating cash flow and available bank credit  as further described below see senior credit facility 
the company s senior credit facility includes certain financial covenants with which the company was in compliance as of december  the company does not anticipate a lack of borrowing capacity under its senior credit facility in the foreseeable future due to an inability to meet any such financial covenants 

table of contents recent property acquisitions in the third quarter of  the company announced its acquisition of interests in two non producing properties in louisiana that required minimal initial expenditures 
pursuant to the first acquisition  the company obtained  via farmout  the right to drill and earn all rights  excluding exploration rights to the crane zone of the pettit formation  in approximately  acres in the bethany longstreet field in northwest louisiana 
the company will retain continuous drilling rights to the entire block so long as it drills at least one well every days 
for each productive well drilled under the agreement  the company will earn an assignment to acres 
the company has begun exploration and development drilling activities in the field and had completed three successful wells as of december  the company anticipates drilling additional wells on the block in and expects that its working interests in the wells will range between and 
under the second acquisition  the company obtained certain rights in the plumb bob field located in st 
martin parish in southern louisiana 
the rights include oil and gas leases covering approximately acres  d seismic permits with oil and gas lease options covering approximately  acres  seven existing shut in wellbores  where the company has identified recompletion projects  and the rights to acquire related production facilities and pipelines upon establishment of production 
the company s plans include a workover and well reactivation program  the shooting of a square mile d seismic survey and post d exploitation and development drilling activities 
the company has begun workover drilling activities in the field and had restored production capability in three wells as of december  the d seismic shoot began during the fourth quarter of and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of based on its expected working interest  the company has budgeted net capital expenditures in the plumb bob field of up to million in the full year sale of oil and gas properties to related party on march   the company monetized a portion of the value created in its burrwood west delta fields by selling a working interest in the existing production and shallow rights  and a working interest in the deep rights below  feet  in such fields for million to malloy energy company  llc mec led by patrick e 
malloy  iii and participated in by sheldon appel  who was a member of the company s board of directors at that time  as well as josiah austin  who subsequently became a member of the company s board of directors mr 
malloy is currently chairman of the company s board of directors and mr 
appel retired from the board of directors in february 
the sale price was determined by discounting the present value of the acquired interest in the fields proved  probable and possible reserves using prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company retained an approximate working interest in the existing production and shallow rights  and a working interest in the deep rights after the close of the transaction 
in conjunction with the sale  mec provided a million line of credit which reduced to million on january  the credit line is subordinate to the company s senior credit facility and can be used for acquisitions  drilling  development and general corporate purposes until december  mec retains the option to convert the amount outstanding under the credit line  and or provide cash on any unused credit  into of the company s working interests in any acquisition s the company makes in louisiana prior to january  mec has elected to participate for of the company s working interest in the two louisiana property acquisitions announced by the company in the third quarter of see recent property acquisitions 
since the company has made no borrowings under the mec credit line to date  mec funded its share of the acquisition costs and will fund its share of the subsequent capital costs related to these acquisitions on a direct basis  rather than by converting borrowings under the credit line 
the company recorded a non recurring gain of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result of the mec sale 
the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt under its senior credit facility 
senior credit facility on november   the company established a  senior credit facility with bnp paribas  with an initial borrowing base of  and a three year term 
in december  the borrowing base was 
table of contents redetermined to be  and bnp paribas and the company agreed to extend the term of the senior credit facility for an additional two years  subject to periodic redeterminations of the borrowing base 
the company s borrowings outstanding under the credit facility amounted to  as of december  and  as of april  interest on borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue at a rate calculated  at the option of the company  at either the bnp paribas base rate plus to  or libor plus  depending on borrowing base utilization 
interest on libor rate borrowings is due and payable on the last day of its respective interest period 
accrued interest on each base rate borrowing is due and payable on the last day of each quarter 
as extended  the senior credit facility will mature on december  the credit facility requires that the company pay a per annum commitment fee  payable in quarterly installments based on the company s borrowing base utilization 
prior to maturity  no principal payments are required so long as the maximum borrowing base amount exceeds the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility requires the company to monitor tangible net worth and maintain a current ratio and an interest coverage ratio above prescribed levels 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all such requirements 
substantially all the company s assets are pledged to secure the senior credit facility 
in february  the company entered into three separate interest rate swaps with bnp paribas covering a three year period  as further described below  and in february  entered into another interest rate swap with bnp paribas for an additional one year period see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk debt and debt related derivatives 
contractual obligations at december   the company had the following contractual obligations outstanding under its long term debt  production payment and operating lease agreements as of december   the company had no material purchase obligations for goods or services that were not incurred in the ordinary course of business total after long term debt production payment operating lease obligation critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in these financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires a significant amount of estimates 
these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  
table of contents technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
impairment of properties the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet to ensure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
the company cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
property retirement obligations the company is required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of its producing oil and gas properties 
this requirement necessitates the company to make estimates of its property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company periodically evaluates its tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in its financial statements 
in prior years  the company has reported a net deferred tax asset on its consolidated balance sheet  after deduction of the related valuation allowance  which has been determined on the basis of management s estimation of the likelihood of realization of the gross deferred tax asset 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability must be recorded in the periods in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed in service 
as of january   the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the company recording a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the amount of  the estimation of the liability involves the projection of future costs to plug and abandon individual wells 
these estimates are based on current costs inflated to the end of the well s economic life and discounted back to the well s origination date 
the liability will be accreted at the estimated discount rate to the expected cash required to settle the liability 
the estimate requires management s judgment with respect to the future plugging and abandonment costs  the life of the well  and the inflation and discount factors used 
changes in these estimates can significantly impact the amount of the liability

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fasb is considering whether an oil and gas company s investment in mineral leases should be classified as intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no

the company does not believe that sfas no 
and sfas no

the eitf has added the discussion of oil and gas mineral leases to its agenda  which may result in a change in the recording and disclosure of oil and gas mineral leases 
should the eitf determine that oil and gas mineral leases are intangible assets  the company would reclassify  and  as intangible undeveloped mineral interests at december  and  respectively 
in addition  a reclassification of  and  would be made as intangible developed mineral interests at december  and  respectively 
both intangible assets would be presented net of accumulated amortization 
historically  undeveloped mineral leases have been amortized over the life of the lease period  while developed mineral leases have been amortized using the units of production method over the expected life of proved reserves 
the amounts included herein are based on the company s understanding of the issue on the eitf s agenda 
if all mineral leases associated with oil and gas properties are deemed to be intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
by the eitf these assets would not be included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet the company does not believe that its net income or cash flows from operations would be materially affected because the amortization of these assets would not be different than the method currently used by the company disclosures required by sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity hedging activity the company enters into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of its production 
the company considers these to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in its crude oil and natural gas sales 
the company s strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to hedge between and of its production 
as of december    all of the commodity hedges utilized by the company were in the form of fixed price swaps  where the company receives a fixed price and pays a floating price based on nymex quoted prices 
as of december   the company s open forward position on its outstanding commodity hedging contracts  all of which were with bnp paribas  was as follows crude oil barrels of oil per day swap at for january through june  and barrels of oil per day swap at for january through june  and barrels of oil per day swap at for july through december natural gas  mmbtu per day swap at for january through december the hedging contracts summarized above fall within the company s targeted range of to of its estimated net oil and gas production volumes for the applicable periods of the fair value of the crude oil and natural gas hedging contracts in place at december  resulted in a liability of  hedge ineffectiveness results from differences in the nymex contract terms and the physical location  grade and quality of the company s oil and gas production 
based on oil and gas pricing in effect at december   a hypothetical increase in oil and gas prices would have increased the liability to  while a hypothetical decrease in oil and gas prices would have resulted in a  asset 
subsequent to december   the company entered into the following crude oil and natural gas hedging contracts with bnp paribas barrels of oil per day swap at for july through december  mmbtu per day swap at for april through october  mmbtu per day swap at for november through december  mmbtu per day swap at for january through march price fluctuations and the volatile nature of markets despite the measures taken by the company to attempt to control price risk  the company remains subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond the company s control 
domestic crude oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis

disclosure regarding forward looking statement this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimates and such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
