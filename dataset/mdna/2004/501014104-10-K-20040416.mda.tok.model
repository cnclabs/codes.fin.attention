on april   krispy kreme closed a public offering of its common stock 
krispy kreme is a leading branded specialty retailer of premium quality doughnuts 
we have established krispy kreme as a leading consumer brand with a loyal customer base through our longstanding commitment to quality and consistency 
the combination of our well established brand  our one of a kind doughnuts  a unique retail experience featuring our stores fully displayed production process  including our doughnut making theater  our vertical integration and our strong franchise system creates significant opportunities for continued growth 
our principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme doughnut stores where we make and sell over varieties of premium quality doughnuts  including our hot original glazed 
each of our traditional stores is a doughnut factory with the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
consequently  each factory store stores which contain a full doughnut making production line has considerable fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly impacted by doughnut production volume and sales 
our doughnut stores are versatile in that most can support multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales and off premises sales as described further under business model store operations 
competitive strengths we believe our success is based on the strengths described below 
the universal appeal of our product 
our market research indicates that krispy kreme s breadth of appeal extends across major demographic groups  including age and income 
in addition to their taste  quality and simplicity  our doughnuts are an affordable indulgence 
this has contributed to many of our customers purchasing doughnuts by the dozen for their offices  clubs and families 
demand for our doughnuts occurs throughout the day  with approximately half of our on premises sales occurring in the morning and half in the afternoon and evening 
a proven concept 
krispy kreme is a focused yet versatile concept 
each of our distinctive krispy kreme traditional factory stores is a doughnut making theater with the capacity  depending on equipment size  to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
our stores serve as our primary retail outlets 
they are also designed to create a multi sensory experience around our unique product and production process  which is important to our brand building efforts 
in addition to on premises sales  we have developed multiple channels of sales outside our stores  which we refer to as off premises sales 
these sales channels improve the visibility of our brand  increase the convenience of purchase and capture sales from a wide variety of settings and occasions 
additionally  the ability to generate sales outside of our stores  utilizing the stores existing production capacity  minimizes the risk of an underperforming on premises sales location 
strong growth potential 
we believe that krispy kreme has significant opportunities for continued growth 
our revenue growth has been driven by new store openings as well as by increases in systemwide comparable store sales of in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we believe the following represent significant growth opportunities for our company domestic store development 
at february   there were krispy kreme factory stores in operation  of which are located in the united states 
in fiscal  we opened factory stores including in the united states 
our recent store development efforts have focused on opening company and franchise factory stores in markets with over  households 
we will continue to expand in these markets because of their dense population characteristics which enable us to achieve economies of scale in local operations infrastructure and brand building efforts 
we will further enhance our expansion through the opening of factory stores in small markets  those with less than  households 
we have also begun testing three additional store formats  referred to collectively as satellites  which we believe will facilitate our expansion 
see satellite store concept below 
international store development 
we continue to develop the capabilities and infrastructure necessary to support markets outside the united states 
through a joint venture  we currently have twelve stores in canada and plan to open additional stores in the canadian market in the future 
we have also entered into joint ventures to develop the markets in australia and new zealand  the united kingdom and the republic of ireland  and mexico 
each of these joint ventures opened its first retail store in fiscal based upon our continued research and experience with our international stores  we are focusing additional international development efforts primarily on opportunities in japan  south korea and other potential markets in asia and western europe 
our ability to expand in these or other international markets  however  will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our product  our ability to supply or obtain the ingredients and equipment necessary to produce our products and local laws or policies of the particular countries 
ultimately  we believe that the opportunity for growth through expansion internationally is at least as great as the domestic opportunity 
satellite store concept 
we continue testing the satellite store concept  which consists of the doughnut and coffee shop  the fresh shop and the kiosk formats 
during fiscal  we introduced the doughnut and coffee shop format 
this store uses the new hot doughnut machine technology  which completes the final steps of the production process and requires less space than the full production equipment in our factory store 
this technology combines time  temperature and humidity elements to re heat unglazed doughnuts  provided by a traditional factory store  and prepare them for the glazing process 
once glazed  customers can have the same hot doughnut experience in a doughnut and coffee shop as in a factory store 
additionally  the doughnut and coffee shop offers our complete line of coffee and other beverages 
as of february   nine doughnut and coffee shops were open  six of which are owned by the company 
we plan to continue our tests of this concept which we believe will help facilitate our expansion into smaller markets and dense urban areas 
additionally  we are testing both the fresh shop and the kiosk formats 
in these formats  we will sell fresh doughnuts  beverages and krispy kreme collectibles 
the doughnuts will be supplied by a nearby factory store  multiple times per day 
both the fresh shop and the kiosk formats will require less space than our traditional factory store or the doughnut and coffee shop 
as the kiosk is a free standing facility  it will require significantly less space than the fresh shop  expanding the number of potential locations where these facilities may be established 
as of february   fresh shops were open 
we view the fresh shop and kiosk formats  which we believe will have attractive financial returns  as additional ways to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
we began our tests of the new fresh shop concept during fiscal and will begin our tests of the kiosk format in fiscal increasing on premises and off premises sales 
in new markets  we typically focus our initial efforts on on premises sales 
we consistently evaluate improvements or additions to our product line to increase same store sales levels and balance seasonality of sales 
once we have established the brand and concept in a market  we then use the factory store platform to secure off premises opportunities with grocery and convenience stores as well as mass merchants 
by offering premium quality products  category management and superior customer service  we intend to expand the number of off premises customers served as well as increase sales to existing accounts 
we also believe that the food service and institutional channel of sales offers krispy kreme an opportunity to extend our brand into colleges and universities  business and industry complexes and sports and entertainment venues 
expanded beverage offerings 
one of our focus areas has been creating a best in class beverage program to complement our doughnut offering 
with an acquisition in fiscal  we acquired significant coffee roasting expertise 
we have since formulated and are in the process of implementing a complete beverage program  including four drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors  and both coffee based and non coffee based frozen drinks 
these drinks are designed to complement our existing juices  sodas  milks and water 
we introduced the first component of this program  the drip coffee offering  to our stores in fiscal  replacing the previous product which was purchased from an unrelated third party 
we anticipate introducing the remaining components of the new beverage program  including frozen beverages in the next six months and espresso in most stores over the next twelve to eighteen months 
we believe this new beverage program represents an opportunity to increase beverage sales in a meaningful way 
montana mills bread co  inc in april  we completed the acquisition  through an exchange of stock  of montana mills bread co  inc montana mills  an owner and operator of upscale village bread stores in the northeastern united states 
as of february   montana mills stores were in operation 
montana mills stores produce and sell a variety of breads and baked goods prepared in an open view format 
we believe that this acquisition will provide an opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities  such as our brand building and operational capabilities including our distribution chain  off premises sales and coffee roasting expertise  to expand montana mills business opportunity 
we anticipate spending up to months refining and expanding the montana mills concept  retaining its core best in class breads  but expanding the offering to include bread based meals and appropriate accompaniments in an inviting setting 
the ingredients for market leadership 
the doughnut industry is highly fragmented and characterized by low volume outlets with undifferentiated product quality 
we believe that we have the ability to become the recognized leader in every market we enter through our unique combination of a strong brand  a highly differentiated product  a high volume production capacity  and a market penetration strategy using multiple sales channels 
a proven franchise system 
krispy kreme is committed to growth in part through franchising 
our franchisees consist of associates who operate under our original franchising program developed in the s and area developers who operate under our franchising program developed in the mid s 
see store ownership 
we intend to continue to strengthen our franchise system by attracting and retaining experienced and well capitalized area developers who have the management capacity to develop multiple stores 
our development strategy permits us to grow in a controlled manner and enables us to ensure that each area developer strictly adheres to our high standards of quality and service 
we prefer that area developers have ownership and successful operating experience in multi unit food operations within the territory they propose for development 
to ensure a consistent high quality product  we require each franchisee to purchase our proprietary mixes and doughnut making equipment 
we devote significant resources to providing our franchisees with assistance in site selection  store design  employee training and marketing 
many of our franchisees are also our shareholders  and we believe that common ownership of equity will serve to further strengthen our relationships and align our mutual interests 
additionally  we intend to continue to acquire equity positions in selected franchisee businesses and also intend to continue to periodically repurchase associate or area developer markets to take advantage of opportunities for synergies and market expansion 
direct store delivery capabilities 
krispy kreme has developed a highly effective direct store delivery system  or dsd  for executing off premises sales 
we deliver fresh doughnuts  both packaged and unpackaged  to a variety of retail customers  such as supermarkets  convenience stores and other food service and institutional accounts 
through our company and franchised store operations  our route drivers are capable of taking customer orders and delivering products directly to our customers retail locations  where they are typically merchandised from krispy kreme branded displays 
we have also developed national account relationships and implemented electronic invoicing and payment systems with many large dsd customers 
we believe these strengths  coupled with our premium products  will provide us with significant sales opportunities by allowing us to assume the role of category manager for doughnut products in both the in store bakery and food service distribution channels 
a controlled process ensuring consistent high quality 
krispy kreme has a vertically integrated  highly automated system designed to create quality  consistency and efficiency 
our doughnut making process starts well before the store level operations with our owned and operated manufacturing plants  which produce our proprietary mixes  our state of the art laboratories that test all key ingredients and each batch of mix produced  and our self manufactured  custom stainless steel doughnut making equipment 
additionally  at the store level  we provide a week manager training program covering the critical skills required to operate a krispy kreme store and a comprehensive training program for all positions in the store 
the manager training program includes classroom instruction  computer based modules and in store training 
the comprehensive training program for store personnel includes procedures for producing and finishing our doughnuts  as well as customer service 
a balanced financial model 
krispy kreme generates sales and income from three distinct sources in our principal business company stores  which we refer to as company store operations  franchise fees and royalties from our franchise stores  which we refer to as franchise operations  and a vertically integrated supply chain  which we refer to as krispy kreme manufacturing and distribution  or kkm d 
in addition to lowering the cost of goods sold for our stores  kkm d generates attractive margins on sales of our mixes  equipment and coffee 
our franchising program lowers our capital requirements and provides a highly attractive royalty stream 
our company store operations  franchise operations and kkm d comprise three reportable segments under generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed above  in april  we completed the acquisition of montana mills 
the operating results of montana mills represent a fourth reportable segment 
the financial data for these segments can be reviewed in note business segment information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal business model krispy kreme is a vertically integrated company structured primarily to support and profit from the high volume production and sale of high quality doughnut products 
high volume with high quality has always been the foundation of our business strategy 
our business is driven by two complementary business units our company and franchised stores  which we refer to collectively as store operations  and kkm d 
independently  each is designed to ensure quality and to benefit from economies of scale 
collectively  both function as an integrated  cost efficient system 
store operations 
the principal source of revenue for stores is the production and distribution of doughnuts 
as part of our unique business model  our factory stores are both retail outlets and highly automated  high volume producers of our doughnuts and can sell their products through our multiple channels 
on premises sales 
each of our stores offers at least of our more than varieties of doughnuts  including our signature hot original glazed and nine other prescribed varieties 
we also sell beverages  including our four drip coffees  espresso based coffees including flavors and both our coffee based and non coffee based frozen drinks which are designed to complement our other beverages  and collectible memorabilia such as tee shirts  sweatshirts and hats 
fundraising sales  described under marketing  are another component of on premises sales 
in order to establish our brand identity with the total store experience and because of the higher margins associated with on premises sales  we typically focus our initial sales efforts in new markets on this channel 
off premises sales 
we accomplish off premises sales through our direct store delivery system which is designed to generate incremental sales  increase market penetration and brand awareness  increase customer convenience  optimize utilization of our stores production capacity  and improve our stores return on investment 
our factory stores that engage in off premises sales focus primarily on major grocery store chains  including kroger  food lion and albertsons  to local and national convenience stores and mass merchants 
kkm d 
the mission of kkm d is to create competitive advantages for our stores while operating as a profitable business enterprise 
we have developed important operating competencies and capabilities  which we use to support our stores  including strong product knowledge and technical skills  control of all critical production and distribution processes  and collective buying power 
the primary raw materials used in our products are flour  sugar  shortening and coffee beans 
we obtain most of these materials under long term purchase agreements and in the commodity spot markets 
although we own the recipe to our glaze flavoring a key ingredient in many of our doughnuts we are currently dependent on a sole source for our supply 
however  we are in the process of establishing an alternative source 
we implement the mission of kkm d through four strategic business units mix manufacturing 
we produce all of our proprietary doughnut mixes at our manufacturing facilities in winston salem  nc and effingham  il 
we control production of this critical input in order to ensure that our products meet quality expectations and to maximize our profit potential 
manufacturing and selling our own mixes allows us to capture the profit that normally would accrue to an outside supplier and is more cost effective than purchasing from third party vendors 
our mixes are produced according to our high quality standards  which include requiring each carefully selected ingredient supplier to meet or exceed industry standards  receiving truckloads of our main ingredients daily  testing each incoming key ingredient  and testing each batch of mix 
equipment manufacturing 
we manufacture proprietary doughnut making equipment  which our franchisees are required to purchase 
our carefully engineered equipment  when combined with our proprietary mixes  produces doughnuts with uniform consistency and high quality 
manufacturing our equipment results in several advantages  including flexibility 
we manufacture several models  with varying capacities  which are capable of producing multiple products and fitting unusual store configurations 
cost effectiveness 
we believe our costs are lower than if we purchased our equipment from third parties 
efficiency 
we continually refine our equipment design to ensure maximum automation in order to manage labor costs and or improve consistency 
distribution centers 
we operate three distribution centers winston salem  nc  effingham  il and greater los angeles  ca  which are capable of supplying our stores with all of their key supplies  including all food ingredients  coffee  juices  signage  display cases  uniforms and various other items 
stores must use our doughnut mixes exclusively 
in addition  most of our store operators have agreed contractually through our supply chain alliance program to purchase all of their requirements for the critical areas of their business from kkm d through fiscal we believe that our ability to distribute supplies to our operators produces several advantages  including economies of scale 
we are able to purchase at volume discount prices  which we believe are lower than those that would be available to our operators individually 
in addition  we are selective in choosing our suppliers and require that they meet certain standards with regard to quality and reliability 
also  inventory is controlled on a systemwide basis rather than at the store level 
convenience 
our distribution centers offer our store operators the convenience of one stop shopping 
we are able to supply all of the key items needed to operate their stores  which enables them to focus their energies on running their stores  rather than managing supplier relationships 
beverage program 
we provide many of the beverages offered in our stores  most of which are purchased from third parties 
one of our focus areas has been  however  creating a best in class beverage program 
through an acquisition in fiscal  we acquired significant coffee roasting expertise 
we have since formulated and are in the process of implementing a complete beverage program  including four drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors  and both coffee based and non coffee based frozen drinks 
we introduced the first component of the program  the drip coffee offering  to our stores in fiscal  replacing the previous product which was purchased from an unrelated third party 
we believe our new beverage program presents an opportunity to ensure a high quality product offering  increase beverage sales through an expanded product offering  and enhance overall profitability 
krispy kreme brand elements krispy kreme is a blend of several important brand elements which has created a special bond with many of our customers 
the key elements are one of a kind taste 
the taste experience of our doughnuts is the foundation of our concept and the common thread that binds generations of our loyal customers 
our doughnuts are made from a secret recipe that has been in our company since we use only premium ingredients  which are blended by our custom equipment  to create this unique and very special product 
doughnut making theaters 
each of our traditional factory stores showcases our doughnut making process 
our goal is to provide our customers with a unique entertainment experience and  in addition  visibly reinforce our commitment to quality and freshness 
hot doughnuts now 
the hot doughnuts now sign  when illuminated  is a signal that our hot original glazed are being made 
the hot doughnuts now sign is a strong impulse purchase generator and an integral contributor to our brand s mystique 
our hot original glazed are made for several hours every morning and evening  and at other times during the day 
destination locations 
our full service factory stores incorporate doughnut making theaters  which are designed to produce a multi sensory customer experience and establish a strong brand identity 
our research indicates that many of our stores have the geographic drawing power comparable to a regional shopping mall 
affordable indulgences 
our doughnuts are reasonably priced to ensure that they are affordable for the widest audience possible 
community relationships 
we are a national company  yet we are committed to strong local community relationships 
our store operators support their local communities through fundraising programs and the sponsorship of charitable events 
many of our loyal customers have warm memories of selling krispy kreme doughnuts to raise money for their schools  clubs and community organizations 
industry overview the doughnut industry is highly fragmented 
we expect doughnut sales to continue to grow due to a variety of factors  including the growth in two income households and a corresponding shift towards foods consumed away from home 
we view the fragmented competition in the doughnut industry as an opportunity for our continued growth 
we also believe that the premium quality of our products and the strength of our brand have enhanced  and will continue to enhance  the growth and expansion of the overall doughnut market 
store development and operations site selection 
our objective is to create highly visible destination locations 
our comprehensive site selection process focuses on high volume traffic  high household density  proximity to both daytime employment and residential centers  and proximity to other retail traffic generators 
we work closely with our franchisees to assist them in selecting sites 
a site selection team visits each site and the surrounding area before approving a store location 
we believe that this process ensures that each new store will comply with our standards 
store operations 
our new factory stores are equipped with automated doughnut making equipment capable of producing from  dozen to  dozen doughnuts daily 
this capacity can support sales in excess of  per week 
we outline uniform specifications and designs for each krispy kreme store and require compliance with our standards regarding the operation of the store  including  but not limited to varieties of products  product specifications  sales channels  packaging  sanitation and cleaning  signage  furniture and fixtures  image and use of logos and trademarks  training  and marketing and advertising 
we also require the use of a computer and cash register system with specified capabilities to ensure the collection of sales information necessary for effective store management 
all of our franchisees provide us with weekly sales reports and periodic financial statements 
we assist our franchisees with issues such as operating procedures  advertising and marketing programs  administrative  bookkeeping and accounting procedures  public relations  and generation of sales and operating data 
we also provide an opening team  which consists of up to nine people  to provide on site training and assistance both for the week prior to and during the first week of operation for each initial store opened by a new franchisee 
the number of opening team members providing this assistance is reduced with each subsequent store opening for an existing franchisee 
our stores which engage in off premises sales typically operate on a hour schedule 
other stores generally operate from am to am  seven days a week  excluding some major holidays 
traditionally  our sales have been slower during the christmas holiday season and the summer months 
quality standards and customer service 
we encourage all of our employees to be courteous  helpful  knowledgeable and attentive 
we emphasize the importance of performance by linking a portion of both a company store manager s and an assistant store manager s incentive compensation to profitability and customer service 
we also encourage high levels of customer service and the maintenance of our high quality standards by frequently monitoring our stores through a variety of methods  including periodic quality audits and mystery shoppers 
in addition  our customer experience department handles customer comments and conducts routine satisfaction surveys of our off premises customers 
management and staffing 
our chief operating officer  along with other corporate officers responsible for store operations  are responsible for corporate interaction with our store operations division directors and store management 
through our divisional directors  each of whom is responsible for a specific geographic region  we communicate frequently with all store managers and their staff using store audits  weekly communications by telephone or e mail and both scheduled and surprise store visits 
we offer a comprehensive week training program  conducted both at our headquarters and at certified training stores  which provides store managers the critical skills required to operate a krispy kreme store 
the program includes classroom instruction  computer based training modules and in store training 
our staffing varies depending on a store s size  volume of business and number of sales channels 
stores with sales through all sales channels have approximately employees handling on premises sales  processing  production  bookkeeping and sanitation and between two to delivery personnel 
area developers frequently hire employees from leasing agencies and employ staff based on store volume and size 
hourly employees  along with delivery personnel  are trained by local store management through hands on experience and training manuals 
we believe that our success is a natural result of the growth and development of our people 
we are developing a career model for both management and non exempt employees which will focus on personal development and career growth 
the program will link an individual s economic  career and personal goals with our corporate and store level goals 
store ownership we divide our stores into three categories of ownership company stores  associate stores and area developer stores 
we refer to associates and area developers as franchisees  collectively 
store counts include retail factory stores and commissaries and exclude our satellite concept stores 
company stores 
as of february   krispy kreme owned stores  including which are operated by consolidated joint ventures 
many of these stores were developed between and and are located predominantly in the southeastern united states 
these stores were designed as wholesale bakeries and generate a majority of their revenues through off premises sales 
through acquisitions of associate and area developer franchisees market rights and related stores in recent years  as well as through new store construction  the number of company stores located outside the southeast has increased 
of the company stores owned by area developers in which we have a controlling interest  are owned by freedom rings  in which we own a interest  and are owned by glazed investments  in which we have an approximate interest 
the terms of our arrangements with area developers as described below are applicable to our agreements with these joint ventures as well 
associates 
we had associates who operated stores as of february  associate stores have attributes which are similar to those of company stores located in the southeast 
this group generally concentrates on growing sales within the current base of stores rather than developing new stores or new territories 
with two exceptions  associates are not obligated to develop additional stores within their territories 
we cannot grant licenses to other franchisees or sell products bearing the krispy kreme brand name within an associate s territory during the term of the license agreement 
associates are typically parties to year licensing agreements  which generally permit them to operate stores using the krispy kreme system within a specific territory 
associates pay royalties of of on premises sales and of all other sales  with the exception of private label sales for which they pay no royalties 
most associates also contribute of all sales to the company administered public relations and advertising fund 
our associates who were shareholders prior to our initial public offering in april have franchise agreements which were extended automatically for a period of years following that offering and thereafter are renewed automatically for five year periods  unless previously terminated by either party 
we do not plan to license any new krispy kreme franchisees under the terms of the associate license agreement 
area developers 
under our area developer franchise program  which we introduced in the mid s to strategically expand nationally into new territories  we license territories  usually defined by metropolitan statistical areas  to area developers who are capable of developing a prescribed number of stores within a specified time period 
area developer stores typically are designed and developed in locations favorable to achieving high volume on premises sales  although they are also equipped to generate off premises sales 
as of february   we had area developers operating stores 
these area developers have contractual commitments to open over stores in their territories during their initial development schedule 
of these area developers  we had a controlling interest in two and a minority equity interest in fifteen 
those in which we have a controlling interest operated stores as of february  and those in which we have a minority interest operated stores as of february  we believe equity investments in our area developer territories more closely align our interests with our area developers and also create greater financial opportunity for the company 
many of our area developers are multi unit food operators with a high level of knowledge about the local territory or territories they will develop and a proven financial capability to fully develop their territories 
our strategy  in part  is to grow through area developers 
our area developer program includes a royalty and fee structure that is more attractive to krispy kreme than that of our associate program  as well as territory development requirements 
each of our area developers is required to enter into two types of agreements a development agreement which establishes the number of stores to be developed in an area and a franchise agreement for each store opened 
area developers typically pay development and franchise fees ranging from  to  for each store they develop 
our current standard franchise agreement provides for a year term 
the agreement is renewable subject to our discretion and can be terminated for a number of reasons  including the failure of the franchisee to make timely payments within applicable grace periods  subject to state law 
area developers generally pay a royalty fee of to on all sales and are required to contribute of all sales to a company administered public relations and advertising fund 
in addition to a franchise agreement  all area developers have signed development agreements which require them to develop a specified number of stores on or before specific dates 
generally  these agreements have a five year term 
if area developers fail to develop their stores on schedule  we have the right to terminate the agreement and develop company stores or develop stores through new area developers or joint ventures in the territory 
generally  we do not provide financing to our franchisees other than in our capacity as an equity investor as described above 
when we are an equity investor  we contribute equity or guarantee debt or lease commitments of the joint venture generally proportionate to our ownership interest 
see note joint ventures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our joint venture investments 
in addition  for area developers in which we own a majority interest  we have provided loans to fund their operations and store development as we believe we can obtain sources of funding more economically than these joint ventures 
marketing krispy kreme s approach to marketing is a natural extension of our brand equity  brand attributes  relationship with our customers and our values 
we believe we have a responsibility to our customers to engage in marketing activities that are consistent with  and further reinforce  their confidence and strong feelings about krispy kreme 
accordingly  we have established certain guiding brand principles  which include we will not attempt to define the krispy kreme experience for our customer  we prefer to have our customers tell their krispy kreme stories and share their experiences with others  we will focus on enhancing customer experiences through product focused  value added activities  and we will develop local  community based relationships in all krispy kreme markets 
to build our brand and drive our comparable store sales in a manner aligned with our brand principles  we have focused our marketing activities in the following areas store experience 
our stores are where customers first experience a hot original glazed 
customers know that when our hot doughnuts now sign in the store window is illuminated  they can see our doughnuts being made and enjoy a hot original glazed within seconds after it passes through the glaze waterfall 
we believe this begins a lifetime relationship with our customers and forms the foundation of the krispy kreme experience 
relationship marketing 
most of our brand building activities are grassroots based and focus on developing relationships with various constituencies  including consumers  local non profit organizations  communities and businesses 
specific initiatives include product donations to local radio and television stations  government agencies and other community organizations good neighbor product deliveries to create trial uses sponsorship of local events and nonprofit organizations our krispy kreme ambassador program  which enlists our fans as ambassadors in new markets to generate awareness and excitement around a new store opening friends of krispy kreme enewsletter sent to those customers that have registered to receive monthly updates about new products  promotions and store openings 
fundraising sales 
fundraising sales are high volume sales to local charitable organizations at discounted prices 
charities in turn resell our products at prices which approximate retail 
we believe that providing a fundraising program to local community organizations and local non profit organizations helps demonstrate our commitment to the local community  enhances brand awareness  increases consumer loyalty and attracts more customers into our stores 
product placement 
since fiscal  as we began growing nationally  there has been a significant increase in our product placements and references to our products in selected films and in television programs  including nbc s today show  the tonight show with jay leno  sex in the city  nypd blue  the practice and the simpsons  among others 
we have been mentioned in more than movies and television shows during the year ended february  and more than movies and television shows during the prior three years 
we have also been featured or mentioned in over  print publications during fiscal and  print publications during fiscal  including the wall street journal  the new york times  the washington post  the los angeles times  newsweek  glamour  instyle and people 
we believe the increasing number of placements and references are a reflection of the growing interest in our product and brand 
advertising 
relationship marketing and product placement have been central to building our brand awareness 
although our marketing strategy has not historically employed traditional advertising  we will occasionally utilize live radio and direct mail to generate awareness and trial usage of our products 
management information systems krispy kreme has a management information system that allows for the rapid communication of extensive information among our corporate office  support operations  company stores  associates and area developers 
our franchisees and other affiliates connect to this system through our intranet and have access to e mail and the ability to provide financial reporting 
our management information systems strategy centers around our corporate portal  mykrispykreme 
com  which leverages intranet  extranet and internet environments 
we have adopted a balanced scorecard approach for measuring key performance drivers in each of our business units 
scorecard data are generated internally through our management information system 
an enterprise resource planning system supports all major financial and operating functions within the corporation  including financial reporting  inventory control and human resources 
a comprehensive data warehouse system supports the financial and operating needs of our company store operations and kkm d 
all company stores have been retrofitted with a windows nt based point of sale  or pos  system 
this pos system provides each store with the ability to more closely manage on premises and off premises sales while providing a kiosk into our intranet 
we poll the sales information from each store s pos system  which gives us the ability to analyze data regularly 
daily two way electronic communication with our stores permits sales transactions to be uploaded and price changes to be downloaded to in store pos servers 
direct store delivery sales operations have access to an internally developed route accounting system networked into the corporate intranet 
information from these systems is polled at multiple times weekly and aggregated into the corporate manufacturing data warehouse 
the company maintains business continuity plans for its locations to protect against business interruption in the event of a system failure resulting from a catastrophe  natural disaster  security breach  power loss  telecommunications failure or other similar event 
these plans include daily comprehensive system backup procedures and use of offsite data recovery centers 
competition our competitors include retailers of doughnuts and snacks sold through supermarkets  convenience stores  restaurants and retail stores 
we compete against dunkin donuts  which has the largest number of outlets in the doughnut retail industry  as well as against regionally and locally owned doughnut shops 
we also compete against other retailers who sell sweet treats such as cookie stores and ice cream stores 
we compete on elements such as food quality  concept  convenience  location  customer service and value 
customer service  including frequency of deliveries and maintenance of fully stocked shelves  is an important factor in successfully competing for shelf space in grocery stores and convenience stores 
we believe that our controlled process  which ensures the high volume production of premium quality doughnuts  makes us strong competitors in both food quality and value 
through our comprehensive site selection process and uniform store specifications and designs  we identify premier locations that are highly visible and increase customer convenience 
we believe that in the in store bakery market  many operators are looking for cost effective alternatives to making doughnuts on site 
with a quality product and recognized brand name  krispy kreme has been able to provide a turnkey program that is profitable for the grocer 
in addition  we also believe that we compete effectively in convenience stores 
there is an industry trend moving towards expanded fresh product offerings during morning and evening drive times  and products are either sourced from a central commissary or brought in by local bakeries 
krispy kreme provides fresh daily delivery  merchandised in an attractive branded display which retailers must use to participate in the program 
through effective signage and merchandising  operators are able to draw customers into the store  thus gaining add on sales 
in the packaged doughnut market  we offer a full product line of doughnuts and snacks that are sold on a consignment basis and are typically merchandised on a free standing branded display 
we compete primarily with other well known producers of baked goods  such as hostess  dolly madison and entenmann s  and some regional brands 
trademarks and trade names our doughnut shops are operated under the krispy kreme name  and we use over federally registered trademarks and service marks  including krispy kreme and hot doughnuts now and the logos associated with these marks 
we have also registered some of our trademarks in approximately other countries 
we license the use of these trademarks to our franchisees for the operation of their doughnut shops 
we also license the use of certain trademarks to convenience stores and grocery stores in connection with the sale of some of our products at those locations 
montana mills stores operate under the montana mills name  which was acquired in connection with its acquisition in april we use a variety of trademarks and services in the operation of the montana mills stores  including six federally registered trademarks and service marks  chief among them montana mills bread and montanamills 
com 
although we are not aware of anyone else using krispy kreme or hot doughnuts now as a trademark or service mark  we are aware that some businesses are using krispy or a phonetic equivalent  such as crispie creme  as part of a trademark or service mark associated with retail doughnut stores 
there may be similar uses we are unaware of which could arise from prior users 
additionally  we are not aware of anyone else who is using montana mills as a trademark or service mark  but there could be other uses of which we are unaware 
when necessary  we aggressively pursue persons who unlawfully and without our consent use our trademarks 
government regulation local regulation 
our stores  both those in the united states and those in international markets  are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities  which may include health  sanitation  safety  fire  building and other agencies in the states or municipalities in which the stores are located 
developing new doughnut stores in particular areas could be delayed by problems in obtaining the required licenses and approvals or by more stringent requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors 
our standard development and franchise agreements require our area developers and associates to comply with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  and indemnify us for costs we may incur attributable to their failure to comply 
food product regulation 
our doughnut mixes are primarily produced at our manufacturing facilities in winston salem  nc and effingham  il 
the north carolina department of agriculture has regulatory power over food products shipped from our winston salem facility 
additionally  shipments from our effingham facility are subject to the applicable governmental rules and regulations 
similar state regulations may apply to products shipped from our doughnut stores to grocery or convenience stores 
many of our grocery and convenience store customers require us to guarantee our products compliance with applicable food regulations 
as is the case for other food producers  numerous other government regulations apply to our products 
for example  the ingredient list  product weight and other aspects of our product labels are subject to state and federal regulation for accuracy and content 
most states will periodically check the product for compliance 
the use of various product ingredients and packaging materials is regulated by the us department of agriculture and the federal food and drug administration 
conceivably  one or more ingredients in our products could be banned  and substitute ingredients would then need to be found 
in connection with our international expansion  we typically export our products  principally our doughnut mixes and coffee  to our franchisees in markets outside the united states 
numerous government regulations apply to both the export of food products from the united states as well as the import of food products into other countries 
if one or more of the ingredients in our products are banned  alternative ingredients would need to be found 
although we intend to be proactive in addressing any product ingredient issues  such requirements may delay our ability to open stores in other countries in accordance with our desired schedule 
franchise regulation 
we must comply with regulations adopted by the federal trade commission ftc and with several state and foreign laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises 
the ftc s trade regulation rule on franchising ftc rule and certain state and foreign laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular or disclosure document containing information prescribed by the ftc rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations 
we also must comply with a number of state and foreign laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
these laws may limit a franchisor s ability to terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause  interfere with the right of free association among franchisees  disapprove the transfer of a franchise  discriminate among franchisees with regard to charges  royalties and other fees  and place new stores near existing franchises 
to date  these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area or country and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into the us congress on several occasions during the last decade  but none has been enacted 
employment regulations 
we are subject to state and federal labor laws that govern our relationship with employees  such as minimum wage requirements  overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements 
many of our on premises and delivery personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
accordingly  further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs 
furthermore  the work conditions at our facilities are regulated by the occupational safety and health administration and are subject to periodic inspections by this agency 
other regulations 
we have several contracts to serve united states military bases  which require compliance with certain applicable regulations 
the stores which serve these military bases are subject to health and cleanliness inspections by military authorities 
these accounts are not material to our overall business 
we are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations  but we currently believe that these will not have a material effect on our operations
