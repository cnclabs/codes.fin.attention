forward looking statements cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the company s historical results or our current expectations or projections 
our business general we are the world s largest beverage company  with four of the world s top five soft drink brands coca cola  diet coke  fanta and sprite 
because we believe in offering choices  we provide a wide variety of nonalcoholic beverages to meet consumers desires and needs 
our company owns or licenses nearly trademarked brands including carbonated soft drinks  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks  water products  teas  coffees and other beverages 
finished beverage products bearing our trademarks are sold in more than countries 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows by manufacturing and selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as some finished beverages 
we generally sell these products to bottling and canning operations  distributors  fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers 
we authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates and syrups into branded finished products  that they then distribute and sell 
bottling partners  in which our company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest  produced and distributed percent of our worldwide unit case volume 
we make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands  including advertising costs  sponsorship fees and special promotional events 
retailers and distributors receive rebates  promotions and point of sale displays 
our bottling partners receive advertising support and funds designated for cold drink equipment 
consumers receive coupons  discounts and promotional incentives 
these marketing expenditures help to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in profitable volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
our company articulates its mission as a promise our company exists to benefit and refresh everyone it touches 
more specifically  through our actions we strive every day to provide quality in the marketplace  enrich the workplace  preserve the environment and strengthen our communities 
building upon the foundation of our promise  we focus on the six strategic priorities discussed in item of this report 
value drivers of our business we believe that executing our six strategic priorities creates value 
consistent with a commitment to effective execution  our company focuses on three key value drivers profitable growth  cost management  and efficient capital structure 
profitable growth 
we believe healthy brands properly supported by marketing and innovation  leveraged across markets and targeted to a broad consumer base drive profitable growth 
our company continues to broaden our family of brands 
in particular  we are expanding and growing our noncarbonated offerings to provide more alternatives to consumers 
with this expansion and growth  our company is focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins 
we further intend to focus on improving margins in faster growing but lower margin countries 
to manage this expansion and growth  we are shifting from a volume focus to a volume and value focus 
the added emphasis on value focuses on gross profit and profit before taxes 
to support this shift  beginning in our compensation incentives emphasize gross profit  profit before income taxes and net income instead of unit case volume 
we believe that tailored brand  package  price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth 
we are implementing these strategies and accelerating profitable growth through close alignment with our bottling partners 
cost management 
a principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supply chain initiatives 
over the past year in north america  japan and china  the coca cola system established supply chain management companies to help increase procurement efficiencies and to centralize production and logistics operations 
lowering supply chain costs improves system economics 
alignment with all bottlers  including ways to achieve additional joint savings  represents a critical area of focus 
cost reduction is another key initiative 
one key area of focus  for example  is to decrease over time general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues 
in  we took steps to streamline and simplify our operations 
refer to note as a result of these streamlining initiatives  apart from the charge to earnings of million  we estimate that the company s financial results benefited by approximately million pretax in and will benefit by at least million pretax on an annualized basis beginning in efficient capital structure 
our capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital 
we believe our strong capital position  our access to key financial markets  our ability to raise funds at a low effective cost and our overall low cost of borrowing provide a competitive advantage 
as our cash flows increase  we expect to increase our share repurchases 
furthermore  dividends increased for the nd straight year in  and we believe that for the foreseeable future  our board of directors intends to increase our dividends 
refer to md a heading financial strategies and risk management 
measurements we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will result in maintaining or improving our gross profit margin  providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues  and optimizing our cost of capital 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operations 
net operating revenues  gross profit  operating income  income before income taxes and net income per share represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  net operating revenues totaled approximately billion  an percent increase from gross profit totaled billion in  a percent increase from operating income was approximately billion  a percent decrease from this amount included a charge of million primarily related to streamlining initiatives 
income before income taxes was approximately billion  virtually the same as net income per share basic and diluted was 
these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 
refer to md a heading operations review 
liquidity and capital resources 
in  our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately billion  a percent increase from for years through  we expect our cumulative net cash provided by operating activities to be in excess of billion 
we believe this demonstrates one of our company s strengths the ability to generate significant cash flows to reinvest in our business 
we utilize the cash in ways that management believes provides the greatest value 
principal uses of our cash flows are share repurchases 
in  share repurchases were approximately billion  and we expect share repurchases to be at least billion 
dividends 
in  dividends were approximately billion  and we increased dividends in capital expenditures 
these totaled million in  and we expect capital expenditures to be less than billion 
refer to md a heading liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
opportunities  challenges and risks operating in more than countries provides unique opportunities for our company 
challenges and risks accompany these opportunities 
our company s promise  six strategic priorities and the value drivers of our business provide the foundation for our response to the opportunities  challenges and risks before us 
looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company 
of these  three key challenges and risks are discussed below 
obesity and inactive lifestyles 
increasing consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a serious risk 
we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem 
our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line  led by coca cola and a wide selection of diet and light beverages  juices and juice drinks  sports drinks and waters 
our commitment also includes adhering to the right policies in schools and in the marketplace  supporting programs to encourage physical activity and to promote nutrition education  and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation  choice and variety 
we are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping to address this issue in cooperation with governments  educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs 
water quality and quantity 
water represents another issue that will increasingly require our company s attention and collaboration with the beverage industry 
water is the main ingredient in every product our industry offers 
it is also a limited resource facing unprecedented challenges from over exploitation  increasing pollution and poor management 
our company and the beverage industry are in an excellent position to share the water expertise we have developed in the communities we serve in resource management  wastewater treatment  rainwater harvesting and even desalination 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world  we expect cooperation will be critical 
free trade 
we believe the benefits of free trade comparative advantage  price competition  labor mobility and ultimately prosperity and economic growth over the long term are clear 
however  the breakdown of trade talks  public pressure against trade organizations and the selective increase in tariffs around the world demonstrate the challenges related to free trade 
it is important for our company in particular and the beverage industry in general to show leadership in communicating the benefits of free trade 
all three of these challenges and risks obesity  water and free trade have the potential to adversely affect our industry 
we expect to work at the industry level to address these matters  and we believe our company is well positioned to have a positive impact related to these challenges and risks 
in addition to the three key challenges and risks impacting our industry as discussed above  we have identified other challenges and risks that could impact the company s future financial results including the following maintenance of brand image and product quality  profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive marketplace 
refer to md a heading profitable growth 
restrictions on imports and exports and sources of supply  duties or tariffs  and changes in governmental regulations  the imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion and remittances abroad  and policy concerns particular to the united states with respect to a country in which the company has operations 
we believe many opportunities accompany these challenges and risks 
among these opportunities  we believe the following opportunities exist for our company 
growth potential for all nonalcoholic beverage categories carbonated soft drinks  waters  juices and juice drinks  teas  coffees and sports drinks  new product introductions  intended to contribute to higher gross profits  premium packages  intended to generate strong revenue growth  significant package  pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth  especially in north america  japan and other key markets  and proper positioning to capture industry growth we believe more than percent of worldwide incremental industry growth through will be from locations outside the united states 
looking back at  we identified several events noted below that negatively impacted our company 
these events impacted seven countries directly and other countries indirectly on five continents  highlighting the risks of operating globally 
despite these challenges and risks  our company posted net operating revenues and net income growth 
processes that allow us to anticipate crises where possible and respond quickly to challenges and risks are critical to our success 
production shutdown of the company s products in venezuela for approximately one half of the first quarter of due to a national general strike and political turmoil  disruption caused by the implementation of a german deposit law on nonreturnable packages  the war in iraq and continued overall political unrest in the middle east  poor weather conditions in japan and parts of north america  fewer consumers in north american restaurants  hotels and leisure channels  outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  product recall in japan surrounding two successful new products  and accusations  which we believe to be false  that our soft drinks in india contain high levels of pesticides 
financial strategies and risk management the following strategies are intended to optimize our cost of capital 
we consider these strategies to be of critical importance in pursuing our goal of maximizing share owner value 
debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow  interest coverage and percentage of debt to capital 
we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital  which increases our return on share owners equity 
as of december   our long term debt was rated a by standard poor s and aa by moody s  and our commercial paper program was rated a and p by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
in assessing our credit strength  both standard poor s and moody s consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the company and certain bottlers including coca cola enterprises inc cce and coca cola hellenic bottling company sa cchbc 
while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company s business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable 
if our credit ratings were reduced by the rating agencies  our interest expense could increase 
additionally  if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline  the company s share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers 
the rating agencies monitor our interest coverage ratio 
generally  this ratio is computed as income before taxes plus interest expense  divided by the sum of interest expense and capitalized interest 
the interest coverage ratio was x  x and x  respectively  for the years ended december   and rating agencies often exclude unusual items from the calculation  however  we calculated the ratios based on our reported results 
we monitor our interest coverage ratio and  as previously indicated  the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings 
however  as described above  the rating agencies aggregate financial data for certain bottlers with our company when assessing our debt rating 
as such  the key measure is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the company and certain bottlers 
both standard poor s and moody s employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio 
these thresholds are not necessarily permanent nor are they fully disclosed to our company 
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world  enabling us to raise funds with a low effective cost 
this posture  coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing 
our debt management policies  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets 
in managing our use of debt  we also monitor the following financial measures december  net debt in billions net debt to net capital ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x our company monitors the financial measures discussed above in conjunction with our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt and other business and financial risks 
the above financial measures trended positively in and  reflecting improved business results and effective capital management strategies 
share repurchases in october  our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million shares of our company s common stock through the table below presents shares repurchased and average price per share under the plan year ended december  number of shares repurchased in millions average price per share since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in through our current program as of december   we have purchased more than billion shares of our company s common stock 
this represents percent of the shares outstanding as of january  at an average price per share of 
we expect to repurchase at least billion of the company s common shares in because we expect our operating cash flows to increase in subsequent years  we also expect to increase repurchases of the company s common shares in subsequent years 
dividend policy at its february meeting  our board of directors again increased our quarterly dividend by approximately percent  raising it to per share  equivalent to a full year dividend of per share in this is our nd consecutive annual increase 
our annual common stock dividend was per share  per share and per share in  and  respectively 
the dividend represents a percent increase from  and the dividend compared to represents an percent increase 
financial risk management our company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward  over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
foreign currency 
we manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
our five geographic operating segments generated approximately percent of operating income outside the united states  therefore  weakness in one particular currency is often offset by strengths in others over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations 
our company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options principally euro and japanese yen and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations 
interest rates 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  as well as our mix of term debt versus nonterm debt 
this monitoring includes a review of business and other financial risks as noted above 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks 
value at risk 
we monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems  including value at risk models 
our value at risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates 
we have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations 
we examined historical weekly returns over the previous years to calculate our value at risk 
the average value at risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year 
as a result of our foreign currency value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments  over a one week period  would decline by less than million  million and million  respectively  using  or average fair values and by less than million and million  respectively  using december  and fair values 
according to our interest rate value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our average or in our december  interest rates over a one week period would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
our december  and estimates also were not material to our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies management discussed with our audit committee the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
basis of presentation and consolidation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest 
refer to note for a discussion of variable interest entities 
we use the equity method to account for our investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
our consolidated net income includes our company s share of the net earnings of these companies 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method impacts certain financial ratios because of the presentation of the detailed line items reported in the financial statements 
however  our consolidated net income for the period and our share owners equity at the end of the period are the same whether the investment in the company is accounted for under the equity method or the company is consolidated 
our judgments regarding the level of influence of each equity method investment include considering key factors such as our ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions 
we use the cost method to account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
in accordance with the cost method  these investments are recorded at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared 
our company eliminates from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions  including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees 
effective february  our company acquired control of coca cola erfrischungsgetraenke ag cceag  the largest bottler of the company s beverage products in germany 
under our policy  we concluded that cceag should be consolidated in our financial statements based on the following 
prior to february  our company accounted for cceag under the equity method of accounting 
our company had an approximate percent ownership interest in the outstanding shares of cceag 
in february  in accordance with the terms of the control and profit and loss transfer agreement cpl  our company obtained control of cceag for a period of up to five years 
furthermore  we also entered into a pooling agreement with certain share owners of cceag that provided our company with voting control of cceag 
in return for control of cceag  the company guaranteed annual payments  in lieu of dividends by cceag  to all other cceag share owners 
additionally  all other cceag share owners entered into either a put or a put call option agreement with the company  exercisable at any time up to the december  expiration date 
our company entered into either put or put call agreements for shares representing an approximate percent interest in cceag 
the spread in the strike prices of the put and call options is only approximately percent 
because the terms of the cpl transferred control and all the economic risks and rewards of cceag to the company immediately  we determined consolidation was appropriate 
refer to note in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
we do not anticipate that interpretation will have a material impact on our basis of presentation and consolidation 
refer to note recoverability of noncurrent assets management s assessment of the recoverability of noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates 
the assessments reflect management s best assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include  among other items  sales volume  prices  inflation  discount rates  marketing spending  exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
these factors are interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties  however  the assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period  the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
operating in more than countries subjects our company to many uncertainties and risks related to various economic  political and regulatory environments 
refer to md a heading our business opportunities  challenges and risks 
as a result  many assumptions must be made by management when determining the recoverability of noncurrent assets 
an example of one uncertainty relates to the deposit law on certain nonreturnable beverage packages enacted by the german government in the first quarter of the change in law on january  and subsequent developments resulted in most retailers delisting nonreturnable packages 
after an initial decrease in volume growth  our management acted quickly to address this matter and  as a result  our business posted sequential quarterly improvements 
the new deposit law has created a difficult environment for the industry  but we believe our management successfully positioned our company to respond to german consumers increasing preference for returnable packaging 
however  if other unexpected political matters or abrupt market shifts occur that impact our industry or our company  certain assets in germany may be at risk for impairment 
we proactively managed and will continue to manage our investments in new returnable lines and related bottling infrastructure to minimize our exposure as the ongoing regulatory changes develop 
we will continue to monitor this situation 
for the following noncurrent assets  we perform tests of impairment  as appropriate 
for the applicable assets  we perform tests when certain conditions exist that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other applicable assets  we perform tests at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired december  carrying value percentage of total assets in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may not be recoverable equity method investments  cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets  property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives  goodwill  bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization many of the noncurrent assets listed above are located in markets that we consider to be developing or to have changing political environments 
these markets include germany  where the future of the nonreturnable deposit law creates uncertainty  the middle east  where political and civil unrest continues  and certain markets in latin america  asia and africa where local economic and political conditions are unstable 
in many of these markets  the company has bottling assets and investments 
the list below reflects the company s carrying value of noncurrent assets in these markets 
by nature  these assets involve inherent risks not relevant to assets located in developed or stable markets 
december  carrying value percentage of applicable line item above in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may not be recoverable equity method investments cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives goodwill bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization equity method and cost method investments 
for most publicly traded investments  the fair value of our company s investment is often readily available based on quoted market prices 
for non publicly traded investments  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals  as appropriate 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and unstable markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we consider our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments  therefore  we generally complete our assessments with a long term viewpoint 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
management s assessments of fair value in accordance with these valuation methodologies represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with our internal planning 
if different fair values were estimated  this could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following table presents the difference between calculated fair values  based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares  and our company s carrying values for significant publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investees in millions december  fair value carrying value difference coca cola enterprises inc    coca cola femsa  sa de sa  coca cola hellenic bottling company sa  coca cola amatil limited  grupo continental  sa coca cola bottling company consolidated coca cola embonor sa coca cola west japan company ltd 
embotelladoras polar sa in instances where carrying value exceeds fair value  the current decline in value is considered to be temporary 
other assets 
our company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume 
additionally  our company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the applicable period 
advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights 
payments under these programs are generally capitalized as other assets in our balance sheets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of these assets by preparing estimates of sales volume  the resulting gross profit  cash flows and other factors 
if the assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to be not recoverable  such assets are written down as appropriate 
property  plant and equipment 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment should be assessed 
such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
if an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually 
such tests for impairment are also required for intangible assets recorded by our equity method investees 
our trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  we review such trademarks and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
we test such trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
such tests include comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analysis  estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate  based on the company s cost of capital rate or location specific economic factors 
income taxes our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of income tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
realization of our deferred tax assets reflects our tax planning strategies 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes 
refer to note contingencies our company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings 
refer to note due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole

in the second quarter of  our company entered into a long term license agreement involving seagram s mixers  a carbonated line of drinks 
in the third quarter of  our company and danone waters of north america dwna formed a new joint venture company  ccda waters  llc ccda for the production  marketing and distribution of dwna s bottled spring and source water business in the united states 
we own a controlling percent interest in the joint venture company  with a license for the use of the dannon and sparkletts brands  as well as ownership of several value brands 
also in the third quarter of  we entered into a master distribution agreement for the evian water brand in the united states and canada 
gallons shipped in increased when compared to as a result of owning and operating these businesses throughout compared to only owning and operating them for a portion of structural changes refer to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling or canning operations 
structural changes had a negative impact in due partially to the deconsolidation of cosmos bottling corporation cbc during the second quarter of this negative impact was partially offset by the inclusion of one additional month of revenue from cceag 
cceag was consolidated in february  therefore  the period contained only months of cceag revenues versus the full year in effective october   the company and all our bottling partners in japan completed a structural change that created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement  production and logistics operations for the entire coca cola system in japan 
as a result of the creation of this supply chain management company in japan  a portion of our company s business has essentially been converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model 
this shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in a reduction of revenues and cost of goods sold  each in the same amount million  thus having no impact on our company s gross profit or operating income 
the formation of this entity included the sale of company inventory and the leasing of certain company assets to this new entity on october   as well as our recording of a liability for certain contractual obligations to japanese bottlers 
such amounts were not material to the company s results of operations 
we expect that both net operating revenues and cost of goods sold will be reduced by approximately million for the nine months ending september  compared to the same period of the timing of acquisitions and structural changes does not occur consistently from period to period 
as a result  anticipating the impact of such transactions on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues and other financial statement line items usually is not possible 
however  we expect to continue to sell bottling interests and buy bottling interests in limited circumstances  and as a result  we will continue to have structural impacts to our financial statements in future periods 
the impact of the weaker us dollar in was driven primarily by the stronger euro that favorably impacted the europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment and the stronger yen that favorably impacted the asia operating segment

refer to note other operating charges operating income in reflected the impact of million of expenses related to the streamlining initiatives 
a majority of the charges related to initiatives in north america and germany 
in north america  the company integrated the operations of three separate north american business units coca cola north america  minute maid and fountain 
in germany  cceag took steps to improve its efficiency in sales  distribution and manufacturing  and our german division office also implemented streamlining initiatives

refer to note interest income and interest expense in  interest income decreased by million compared to primarily due to lower interest rates earned on short term investments 
nevertheless  the company continues to benefit from cash invested in locations outside the united states earning higher interest rates than could be obtained within the united states 
conversely  a majority of our interest expense is incurred on borrowings in the united states 
interest expense in decreased by million mainly as a result of both a decrease in average commercial paper debt balances and lower interest rates for commercial paper borrowings 
a majority of the decrease of million in interest income compared to was due to lower interest rates earned on short term investments during the decrease in interest expense of million versus was due to both a decrease in average commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates for commercial paper borrowings

equity income net equity income for the majority of our investees increased during due to the overall improving health of the coca cola bottling system around the world

effective may   one of our company s latin american equity method investees  coca cola femsa  sa de sa coca cola femsa  consummated a merger with another of the company s latin american equity method investees  panamerican beverages  inc panamco 
our company received new coca cola femsa shares in exchange for all the panamco shares previously held by the company 
our company s ownership interest in coca cola femsa increased from percent to approximately percent as a result of this merger 
this exchange of shares was treated as a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets  and no gain was recorded by our company as a result of this merger 
in connection with the merger  coca cola femsa management initiated steps to streamline and integrate the operations 
this process included the closing of various distribution centers and manufacturing plants 
furthermore  due to the challenging economic conditions and an uncertain political situation in venezuela  certain intangible assets were determined to be impaired and written down to their fair market value 
during  our company recorded a noncash charge of million primarily related to these matters 
this charge is included in the line item equity income net 
the million increase in equity income net  as compared to  was due to the overall improving health of the coca cola bottling system around the world and the favorable impact of reduced amortization resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
specific items with a positive impact to equity income net were the increase in equity income for cce of approximately million due to improving trends in operating and financial performance which included a million favorable impact resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
and the reduction in amortization expenses of approximately million for investments other than cce resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
 equity income net for increased by approximately million 
these increases were offset by selected equity method investments in latin america that had been adversely impacted by economic difficulties  as well as our company s share of impairment and restructuring charges taken by certain equity method investees in latin america during the third quarter of the company s share of these charges was approximately million 
for  our company s share of income from equity method investees was also favorably impacted by a benefit related to our share of the gain on the sale by cervejarias kaiser sa kaiser sa of its interests in cervejarias kaiser brazil  ltda to molson inc refer to note 
approximately million of our share of the pretax gain from the sale by kaiser sa was recorded in the line item equity income net with the remaining portion  million  recorded in the line item other income loss net 
other income loss net other income loss net was a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for  a difference of million 
the significant portion of this difference related to a million charge discussed below in  and no such charge applied to this line item in primarily consisted of foreign exchange losses of million and accretion of million for the discounted value of the cceag liability 
other income loss net in was principally composed of foreign currency exchange losses of approximately million  the accretion of the discounted value of the cceag liability of approximately million refer to note  the items discussed in this section below and minority interest accruals 
the losses on currency exchange primarily occurred in latin america and africa  which experienced significant devaluation of currencies 
the increase in the minority interest accruals primarily related to the acquisitions of our interests in cbc and ccda 
refer to note in the first quarter of  our company recorded a noncash pretax charge of approximately million  primarily related to the write down of certain investments in latin america 
this write down reduced the carrying value of the investments to fair value 
the charge was primarily the result of economic developments in argentina during the first quarter of  including devaluation of the argentine peso and the severity of the unfavorable economic conditions 
the company expects to realize a minimal tax benefit from this write down 
the impact on diluted earnings per share was an after tax reduction of approximately per share 
as previously noted  million of our share of the pretax gain from the sale by kaiser sa was recorded in the line item other income loss net in gains on issuances of stock by equity investees if and when an equity investee issues its stock to third parties at a price in excess of our book value  our company s equity in the underlying net assets of that investee increases 
we generally record an increase to our investment account and a corresponding gain for these transactions 
in  our company recorded approximately million of noncash pretax gains on issuances of stock by equity investees 
these gains primarily related to the issuance by cce of common stock valued at an amount greater than the book value per share of our investment in cce 
this transaction reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of cce common stock by less than percent 
in july  cce completed its acquisition of hondo incorporated and herbco enterprises  inc  collectively known as herb coca cola 
the transaction was valued at approximately billion  with approximately percent of the transaction funded with the issuance of approximately million shares of cce common stock  and the remaining portion funded through debt and assumed debt 
the issuance of shares resulted in a noncash pretax gain for our company of approximately million 
this gain represents the increase in our company s equity in the underlying net assets of the related investee 
this transaction reduced our ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of cce common stock from approximately percent to approximately percent 
no gains on issuances of stock by equity investees were recorded to our statements of income during refer to note income taxes our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the united states  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of percent 
during  the company s results benefited from a lower effective tax rate because of increased profit contributions from lower taxed locations resulting from favorable currency exchange rates and other business conditions 
our effective tax rate of approximately percent for the year ended december  reflects the following the favorable resolution of various tax matters approximately million during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by additional taxes primarily related to the repatriation of funds  the effective tax rate for the costs related to the streamlining initiatives of approximately percent  the effective tax rate for the proceeds received related to the vitamin antitrust litigation matter of approximately percent  the effective tax rate for the charge related to a latin american equity investee of approximately percent  and the effective tax rate for all other pretax income of approximately percent 
the effective tax rate for of percent included the impact of the following the effective tax rate for our share of the gain on the sale of kaiser sa interests of approximately percent  we concluded it was more likely than not that tax benefits would not be realized on the write down of certain investments  primarily in latin america  thus we recorded a valuation allowance to offset the future tax benefit resulting in an increase of our effective tax rate  and the effective tax rate for all other pretax income of approximately percent 
during the first quarter of  the us and japan taxing authorities entered into an advance pricing agreement apa whereby the level of royalties paid by coca cola japan company  ltd 
our subsidiary to our company was established for the years through pursuant to the terms of the apa  our subsidiary filed amended returns for the applicable periods reflecting the negotiated royalty rate 
these amended returns resulted in the payment during the first and second quarters of of additional japanese taxes 
the effect on our financial performance and our effective tax rate was not material  due primarily to offsetting tax credits utilized on our us income tax returns 
the majority of the offsetting tax credits were realized in the first quarter of looking into and for the foreseeable future  based on current tax laws  the company s effective tax rate on operations is expected to be approximately percent 
cumulative effect of accounting change for sfas no 
 net of income taxes the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
as of january  resulted in a noncash  after tax decrease to net income of million for company operations and million for the company s proportionate share of its equity method investees 
the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a pretax reduction in amortization expense of approximately million  and an increase in equity income of approximately million 
refer to notes and volume we measure our sales volume in two ways gallons and unit cases of finished products 
gallons is a unit of measurement for concentrates  syrups  beverage bases  finished beverages and powders in all cases  expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup for all beverage products which are reportable as unit case volume 
most of our revenues are based on gallon sales  as discussed under item and md a heading net operating revenues 
gallon sales and unit case volume are not necessarily equal during any given period 
items such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases and new product introductions can create differences between gallon sales and unit case volume 
although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume  we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level 
the coca cola system sold approximately billion unit cases of our products in and approximately billion unit cases in approximate and unit case volume growth results are as follows percentage change vs

in  our company expended cash of approximately million for acquisitions of our interests in cbc and ccda 
in  our company completed several acquisitions  however  none was individually material 
refer to note in july  we made a convertible loan of approximately million to the coca cola bottling company of egypt tccbce 
the loan is convertible into preferred shares of tccbce upon receipt of governmental approvals 
additionally  upon certain defaults under either the loan agreement or the terms of the preferred shares  we have the ability to convert the loan or the preferred shares into common shares 
at december   our company owned approximately percent of the common shares of tccbce 
in november  cchbc approved a share capital reduction totaling approximately million euros and the return of euros per share to all share owners 
in december  our company received our share capital return payment from cchbc equivalent to million

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
in accordance with the definition under securities and exchange commission rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for our company 
on december   our company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of million 
management concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our company is not probable 
in december  we granted a million stand by line of credit to coca cola femsa with normal market terms 
we do not provide any other guarantees 
as of december   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
additionally  our company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our balance sheets 
refer to notes and our company has equity ownership interests in bottlers that we currently account for under the equity method of accounting 
for certain entities  primarily bottlers  our company holds variable interests such as providing financing and guarantees  in addition to our equity investments 
as a result  these entities are considered variable interest entities  and we expect to consolidate such variable interest entities effective march  refer to note the difference between consolidation and the equity method impacts certain financial ratios because of the presentation of the detailed line items reported in the financial statements 
however  consolidated net income for the period and our share owners equity at the end of the period are the same whether the investment is accounted for under the equity method or is consolidated 
aggregate contractual obligations 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows in millions payments due by period total and thereafter short term loans and notes payable commercial paper borrowings   lines of credit and other short term borrowings current maturities of long term debt long term debt    estimated interest payments  marketing and other commitments  purchase commitments     other long term liabilities liability to cceag share owners   miscellaneous total contractual obligations    refer to note for information regarding short term loans and notes payable 
upon payment of commercial paper borrowings  we typically expect to issue new commercial paper borrowings 
lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs  especially at international subsidiaries 
refer to note for information regarding long term debt 
we expect to settle such long term debt by several options including cash flows from operations  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
we calculated estimated interest payments for short term loans and notes payable and long term debt as follows 
for fixed rate debt and term debt  we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates 
for variable rate debt and or nonterm debt  we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short term borrowings 
refer to note for information regarding marketing and other commitments 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
we have excluded expected payments for volume related programs  such as payments to unconsolidated bottlers or customers that are generally determined and committed to on an annual basis 
the purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
the amount represents the estimated cash to be paid to cceag share owners 
refer to note for discussion of the present value of our liability to cceag share owners 
we will consider several options to settle this liability including cash flows from operations  issuance of commercial paper  or issuance of other long term debt 
the remaining miscellaneous amount represents several individually insignificant items that will require liquidity in future periods 
we generally expect to fund these items with cash flows from operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december  is  million 
refer to note this accrued liability is included in the balance sheet line item other liabilities 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with erisa regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and in accordance with irs regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the minimum required contribution for our primary qualified us pension plan for the plan year is and is anticipated to remain for at least the next several years due to large contributions made to the plan over the past three years 
therefore  we did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in the above table 
however  the following provides information about contributions 
we contributed million to the primary us qualified pension plan in january  and we anticipate contributing up to an additional million to this plan later in  or contributing up to the maximum deductible amount 
furthermore  we expect to contribute up to million to the us postretirement health care benefit plan during we funded the million payment with cash flows from operations  and we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operations 
our international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
we do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in or years thereafter 
therefore  no amounts have been included in the table above 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of plan assets was  million 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was million 
the majority of this difference is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non us employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions  as well as our unfunded us nonqualified pension plans 
these us nonqualified pension plans provide benefits for certain members of management that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code 
disclosure of amounts in the above table regarding expected benefit payments to unfunded pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
however  in order to inform the reader about such payments  we anticipate annual payments to be in the range of approximately million to million in and remain at or near this annual level for the next several years 
deferred income tax liabilities as of december  were million 
refer to note this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis that will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have any connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
minority interests of million as of december  for consolidated entities in which we do not have a percent ownership interest were recorded in the balance sheet line item other liabilities 
such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources  therefore  this amount is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and governmental actions 
we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we use functional currencies 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are often offset by strengths in others 
in  and  the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducts operations all operating currencies  and for certain individual currencies  strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows year ended december  all operating currencies australian dollar british pound euro japanese yen mexican peso south african rand these percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange on our operating results 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange on net income and earnings per share 
taking into account the effects of our hedging activities  the impact of a weaker us dollar increased our operating income by approximately percent in the impact of a stronger us dollar reduced our operating income by approximately percent in and approximately percent in based on forecasts as of december   the company expects exchange to have a positive impact on our operating results when compared to exchange gains losses net amounted to million in  million in and million in and were recorded in other income loss net in our statements of income 
exchange gains losses net include the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our balance sheet 
refer to note financial position our balance sheet as of december   as compared to our balance sheet as of december   was impacted by the following a  million increase in cash and cash equivalents due primarily to increased cash flows from operations  the increase in our equity method investment in coca cola femsa of million and the decrease in equity method investments  other  principally bottling companies  of million were primarily due to the merger of coca cola femsa and panamco 
refer to note the overall increase in equity method investments of approximately million from december  to december  was primarily due to a benefit in currency translation and an increase in equity income  net of dividends 
the increase in other assets from  million at december  to  million at december  resulted primarily from company contributions of million to the primary us qualified pension plan and a reversal of million related to the additional minimum liability for the company s primary us qualified pension plan because the plan did not have an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation as of december  the overall increase in total assets as of december  compared to december  primarily related to the increase in cash and cash equivalents mentioned above which impacted our corporate operating segment and the impact of a stronger euro which impacted our europe  eurasia and middle east operating segment and japanese yen which impacted our asia operating segment  partially offset by the impact of weakening currencies impacting the latin america segment 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world 
in general  we believe that over time we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability 
forward looking statements certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company may constitute forward looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements made in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
generally  the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  project  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to volume growth  share of sales and earnings per share growth and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our company s historical experience and our present expectations or projections 
as and when made  management believes that these forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following are some of the factors that could cause our company s actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in or underlying our company s forward looking statements economic and political conditions  especially in international markets  including civil unrest  product boycotts  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
without limiting the preceding sentence  the current unstable economic and political conditions and civil unrest in the middle east  north korea or elsewhere  the unstable situation in iraq  or the continuation or escalation of terrorism  could have adverse impacts on our company s business results or financial condition 
changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment 
these include  without limitation  changes in consumer preferences  including changes based on health and nutrition considerations  competitive product and pricing pressures  and our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the global market as a result of actions by competitors 
factors such as these could impact our earnings  share of sales and volume growth 
foreign currency rate fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
most of our exposures to capital markets  including foreign currency and interest rates  are managed on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and  thus  take advantage of any natural offsets 
we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks 
there can be no assurance  however  that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing capital market exposures 
adverse weather conditions  which could reduce demand for company products 
the effectiveness of our advertising  marketing and promotional programs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials  the cost of energy  transportation and other necessary services  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  and our ability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters  power outages  labor strikes or the like 
our ability to achieve earnings forecasts  which are generated based on projected volumes and sales of many product types  some of which are more profitable than others 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the projected level or mix of product sales 
our ability to effectively align ourselves with our bottling system as we focus on increasing the investment in our brands  seeking efficiencies throughout the supply chain  delivering more value for our customers  and better meeting the needs of our consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  laws concerning food and beverages  competition laws  employment laws and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions 
our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets  which also depends on economic and political conditions  and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities  distribution networks  sales equipment and technology 
moreover  the supply of products in developing markets must match the customers demand for those products  and due to product price and cultural differences  there can be no assurance of product acceptance in any particular market 
the uncertainties of litigation  as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our company s securities and exchange commission filings
