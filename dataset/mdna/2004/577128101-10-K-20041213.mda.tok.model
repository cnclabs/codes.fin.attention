matthews international corporation has a three pronged strategy to attain the annual growth rate objective  which has remained unchanged from the prior year 
this strategy consists of the following internal growth which includes productivity improvements  new product development and the expansion into new markets with existing products  acquisitions and share repurchases under the company s stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources 
the significant factors impacting the company s fiscal results were the recent acquisitions of cloverleaf  intouch and holjeron and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
in addition  the growth in operating results by the european graphics businesses exceeded the company s expectations and the company does not currently anticipate similar growth in fiscal additionally  the company remains concerned with the continued high cost of bronze and steel 
while fiscal cost initiatives and productivity improvements mitigated some of this impact  the significantly higher costs will be a challenge in fiscal  particularly in the competitive markets which the company serves 
finally  the company is adding a new lower cost casket manufacturing plant in mexico in fiscal and the costs associated with this expansion will negatively affect short term operating results 
based on anticipated internal growth  the impact of the company s recent acquisitions and the factors discussed above  the company currently expects to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of to for the fiscal year ending september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  unless such lives are considered to be indefinite 
a significant decline in cash flows generated from these assets may result in a write down of the carrying values of the related assets 
pension costs pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets  the expected return on plan assets and changes in the selected discount rate will affect the amount of pension cost

the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of post retirement health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
when adopted  fsp will supersede fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which was issued in january and permitted a sponsor of a post retirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to def er accounting for the effects of the act until more authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy was issued
