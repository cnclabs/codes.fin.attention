net proceeds of the sale were million resulting in a gain of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including asset impairment and provision for doubtful accounts 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
financial statement captions that could be affected by these types of estimates include property  net receivables including net notes receivable and net mortgage loans receivable  revenues and operating expenses 
revenue recognition the company derives its real estate revenues primarily from the leasing of its properties to operators primarily restaurants on a triple net basis 
triple net leases typically require the tenants to be responsible for property operating costs  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and  in some cases  the ground rents  where applicable 
accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have not reflected property taxes and insurance costs or reimbursement revenues where the tenant legally assumed responsibility for these liabilities 
as the company remains legally responsible for ground rents under its ground leases and receives payment from its tenants for these costs  amounts reimbursed from tenants for ground rents are recorded as rent 
table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue 
the company recorded rent revenues associated with ground lease reimbursements of million  million and million  of which million  million and million were reflected in income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
rent revenues and expenses under operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis  unless significant collection problems occur with the lessee  at which time rents are recorded on a cash basis 
indicators of possible doubtful collection may include bankruptcy filings and anticipated work out agreements 
in addition  if the company has collected no payments on a particular receivable for over five months  revenue would be recorded on a cash basis as well 
once a tenant has been placed on cash basis accounting  it remains on that basis until there have been several months of on time payments received 
contingent rent is recognized as revenue after the related lease sales targets are achieved 
interest income on notes and mortgages receivable is recorded on an accrual basis 
however  when circumstances indicate that the ultimate collection of interest is doubtful  interest is recorded on a cash basis 
the company derives its retail revenues from the sale of gasoline  car washes  convenience store merchandise and food sales at restaurants operated by the company 
revenue is recognized upon the sale of gasoline  merchandise or the delivery of services 
asset impairment the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include default of lease terms  non payment or late payment of rents  decreases in tenant s sales levels and general declines in the success of the operating brand names of its tenants 
when these indicators are present  the company reviews the circumstances and  if an impairment is necessary because the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the net carrying amount of the asset  determines an estimate of the fair market value of the property affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly analyzes its receivables on an individual basis for uncollectibility and the related reserves are analyzed for adequacy 
accounts receivable balances that are  or more and have been outstanding for days or more are reviewed 
all balances due from these tenants are reviewed and evaluated  including rent receivables  notes receivable  mortgage loans receivable  interest receivable and straight line rent receivables 
all information regarding the creditworthiness of the tenants and debtors are reviewed  including bankruptcy filings and sales reports 
company policy is to individually review at least of the accounts receivable that are over days past due  with the remaining past due amounts analyzed on an aggregate basis 
once a reserve has been established for a tenant or debtor  the company maintains that reserve until there has been a proven history of cash payment performance 
after at least two months of cash payments  the circumstances pertaining to the tenant or debtor are reevaluated to estimate the ultimate collectibility of the receivable 
receivables are written off only with the written approval of a member of the executive management of the company 
each note and mortgage loan receivable with amounts past due for over five months or which are otherwise problematic or of concern due to other factors are included in the analysis 
the company evaluates its notes and mortgage loans receivables in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
a note or mortgage is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the excess of the recorded investment in the loan over either the present value of expected future cash flows including costs to sell  if applicable discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or if foreclosure is probable 
a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral 
impairments are recognized by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for doubtful accounts or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment  the company recalculates the impairment and adjusts the valuation allowance if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of an impaired loan s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously projected

management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate the business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of the company s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental performance measure to exclude historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the company s ffo is computed as net income loss available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  income loss allocable to minority interest holders and extraordinary items and is computed in accordance with the nareit white paper definition of ffo 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has improved management s and the investing public s understanding of reit operating results 
further  the use of ffo has made comparisons of those results more meaningful and has enabled the evaluation of the company s operating performance compared to other reits that use the nareit definition in order to make more informed business decisions based on industry trends or conditions 
therefore  the company considers ffo a useful measure for reviewing its comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in the comparison of the operating performance of real estate between periods or as compared to other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
while the company adheres to the nareit definition of ffo in making its calculation  the company s method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and accordingly may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies

inflation while a few of the company s leases are subject to adjustments for increases in the consumer price index  the majority of the leases contain fixed escalation clauses which reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
additionally  to the extent inflation increases tenant s sales volume  percentage rents may tend to offset the effects of inflation on the company 
because triple net leases also require the restaurant operator to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs including environmental costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the property operator and not by the company 
inflation does impact the company through the purchase of gasoline by the retail segment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading purposes  nor does the company have any foreign operations and thus is not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 

table of contents 
index to financial statements market risk on investments the fair value of the company s investment portfolio would be negatively affected by a decrease in interest rates 
since the majority of the company s investments are interest bearing and therefore subject to the market risk of loss from a decline in rates  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be affected adversely 
however  at december   the company s investment portfolio has been reduced to million  and changes in value relating to market risks would not significantly impact the company s operations 
the company also has investments in fixed rate notes and mortgage loans receivable 
changes in interest rates do not have a direct impact on interest income related to these notes and loans 
market risk on variable rate debt the company s interest rate risk is sensitive to interest rate changes on its variable rate debt 
the company had total outstanding debt of million at december   of which approximately million was variable rate debt 
of this amount  million  or was unhedged 
all other things being equal  the interest expense on the company s unhedged variable rate debt will decrease as interest rates decline and will increase as rates rise 
exposure to interest rate risk is generally managed using derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  in conjunction with a portion of the company s variable rate debt to mitigate the interest rate risk on an associated financial instrument or to lock in an interest rate on its variable rate debt under its credit agreement with boa and its triple net lease mortgage certificates 
fair values for the company s derivative instruments were obtained from broker statements 
as it relates to unhedged variable rate debt  if market interest rates average more than in  the impact related to additional annual interest expense would decrease net income and cash flows by million for this amount was determined by calculating the effect of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s unhedged variable rate debt 
this sensitivity analysis assumes that there are no changes in the company s financial structure 
management believes that the fair value of its variable rate debt equals its carrying value at december  and market risk on fixed rate debt the company s long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to market risk 
fixed rate debt outstanding at december  was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt will increase as rates decline and will decrease as rates rise 
the fixed rate notes payable and the mortgage note payable totaling million at december  had a fair value of million based on interest rates for notes with similar terms and remaining maturities which management believes the company could obtain
