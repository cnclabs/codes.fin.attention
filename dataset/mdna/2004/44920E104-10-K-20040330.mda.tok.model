million and 
million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our losses have been financed primarily by the issuance of related party loans  the sale of equity in our company and through the issuance of equity for services 
we expect our net losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
our business model has changed substantially over the last several years 
during and  we shifted our business model from being a provider of broadband entertainment channels with revenues derived from advertising  to a developer of media  entertainment and technology products and services 
this shift in focus was implemented primarily through acquisitions  as described below 
we intend to grow our business by acquiring additional companies  with a focus on media  entertainment and technology businesses  as well as by developing our own media and technology products 
the acquisition of fan club and rex tokyo and the development of the internet acceleration technology with quikcat and quikcat australia are key components of our strategy to shift our revenue model from broadband entertainment channels and revenues derived from advertising to a renewed focus on developing media technology products and services and on licensing revenues 
we may develop such media technology products and services internally  or acquire them from other parties

our major shareholder has indicated a willingness to support our financing efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that the we will be able to secure additional funding  or that if such funding is available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us  from our major shareholder or otherwise 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we would incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage ownership of all holders of common stock 
if we do raise more equity capital in the future  it is likely that it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders

debt and equity financing of capital transactions beneficial conversion features we have adopted eitf issues  accounting for convertibles securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and  application of issue no 
to certain convertible securities in accounting for the convertible debt 
eitf recognition of a conversion feature that is in the money at issuance as additional paid in capital  measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature 
the intrinsic value of the feature is the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the stock into which the security is convertible  multiplied by the number of shares 
according to eitf  the issuance proceeds should not be reduced by issuance costs when calculating the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
these beneficial conversion features of debt or equity instruments  depending on the specific facts and circumstances will determine whether such beneficial conversion feature is to be recorded as an expense to be amortized over a period of time  expensed immediately or recorded as a deemed dividend

our major shareholder has indicated a willingness to support our financing efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that the we will be able to secure additional funding  or that if such funding is available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us  from our major shareholder or otherwise 
moreover  if we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing  we would incur substantial interest expense 
sales of additional equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage ownership of all holders of common stock 
if we do raise more equity capital in the future  it is likely that it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders 
any inability to obtain additional financing may materially effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our common stock could be delisted from the american stock exchange amex in may  we received notice from the amex staff indicating that we were below certain of amex s continued listing standards  due to losses in two of our most recent fiscal years with shareholder equity below million  and had sustained losses so substantial in our overall operations that it appeared questionable  in the opinion of the exchange  as to whether we would be able to continue operations  as set forth in section a i and section a iv of the amex company guide 
we were afforded the opportunity to submit a plan of compliance to amex and on july  presented our plan  with a further amended submission on september  on september   amex notified us that it accepted our plan of compliance and granted us an extension until november  to regain compliance with the continued listing standards 
we will be subject to periodic review by amex staff during the extension period  during which we will be required to make progress consistent with the plan and to regain compliance with the continued listing standards 
failure by our stockholders to approve or ratify the proposals we are presenting at our annual stockholder meeting or not achieving our plan of compliance accepted by amex could result in our common stock being delisted from amex  which could materially affect the ability of our stockholders to dispose of their shares and reduce the liquidity of their investment 
in addition  delisting could affect our ability to obtain financing to support future operations and acquisitions 
we may engage in acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures that could result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we may engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions  mergers  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as part of our business strategy  we completed one acquisition during early  one acquisition in august  and one acquisition in march  invested in a joint venture in july  and sold a business in december  such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities on potentially unfavorable terms  incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too much of our stock as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time at both companies during the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been smaller  private companies  the need to incorporate acquired technology  content or rights into our products and unanticipated expenses related to such integration  and the need to successfully develop an acquired in process technology to achieve the value currently capitalized as intangible assets 
from time to time  we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines  technologies and businesses 
if divestiture such as this does occur  we cannot be certain that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we are dependent on certain third party licenses and agreements we rely on certain agreements and technologies we license from third parties to operate our business 
we have been developing our own proprietary internet accelerator product in conjunction with quikcat technologies  inc quikcat an ohio based private company 
development of the interface for this product was outsourced  with the core patent based technology being licensed from quikcat 
we own the client interface software that was developed to work with the inet client software  and receive a royalty from quikcat australia on their net profits from the sales of their services that incorporate the client interface 
we have no other contracts or agreements with other companies at this time for the client interface software 
the internet acceleration service is software based and uses a combination of highly advanced and proven compression and caching technologies to increase substantially the speed of delivery of internet and email data to the end user 
we believe that our client interface software substantially enhances the core technology licensed to us by quikcat and is critical to the commercial development and acceptance of the service 
we were granted an exclusive reseller license agreement by quikcat for the inet client software on october  for the territories of australia  new zealand and japan 
this license was approved by the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of ohio on december  the cost of the license was  of which  was paid on september  and the balance was paid on january  the license term is for three years  with one year annual automatic renewals if the product is commercially deployed

dr lafe  the inventor of the ip  holds the underlying patents to the ip and has assigned these to icg 
quikcat itself is in us chapter bankruptcy 
our position is protected by us court endorsement of the license 
as part of the agreement to license the internet accelerator  we protected our access to the quikcat source code via an escrow agreement and the deposit of the source code with an escrow agent 
as part of our strategy to develop our internet data acceleration products  on february   we entered into an agreement with quikcat to acquire substantially all of its assets of quikcat for  plus the assumption of certain contracts  agreements and liabilities 
quikcat has filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of ohio  and therefore  our acquisition is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
notwithstanding our signed purchase agreement  there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve our bid or that the bankruptcy court will not award the assets to another bidder 
in addition  we are in discussions with the parent company of quikcat  innovative computing group  inc icg  to acquire certain assets of icg that are related to the technology that we intend to acquire from quikcat 
as part of these discussions  on february   we agreed to loan icg up to  secured by source code for the miliki supercompressor  which is a software product that compresses electronic documents and images and allows a user to email large files much faster and to save these files using much less storage space 
we have advanced  to icg under this loan agreement

the company cannot make any assurances about the relationship between cyberbred and marvel 
we are subject to competitive pressures while we are not aware of any organization that is providing the complete suite of services under the same business model we are utilizing  in general  we face competition from other providers of services to entities that provide internet data transmission acceleration products or which provide advertising  merchandising  publishing  website and data management services

our success will depend on the performance of our officers  our ability to retain and motivate our officers  our ability to integrate new officers into our operations and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team
