executive summary our business we are an owner and operator of television stations in mid sized markets in the united states 
we currently operate stations and are headquartered in providence  ri 
our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from the networks for the broadcast of their programming and from other broadcast related activities 
we receive revenues for advertising time placed within and adjoining our locally originated programming and within and adjoining our network and syndicated programming 
advertising rates for a given station are set based upon a variety of factors  including the size and demographic makeup of the market served 
table of contents by the station  the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the availability of alternative advertising media in the station s market area  a station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area and the program s or station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting 
our advertising rates are also affected by our sales efforts in the local and national arenas and the development of projects  features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming 
approximately two thirds of our advertising time sales are generated within our local markets compared to one third of advertising time sales which are made to national advertisers 
our advertising revenues are seasonal and are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  due in part to increases in retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and active advertising in the spring 
in addition  advertising revenues are generally higher during election years due to spending by political candidates 
during years in which the olympic games are held  there is additional demand for advertising time and  as a result  increased advertising revenue associated with olympic broadcasts 
as a result  the fluctuation in our operating results is generally related to fluctuations in the revenue cycle within a year or on a year to year basis 
the broadcast television industry is also cyclical in nature  being affected by prevailing economic conditions 
since we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues  our operating results are sensitive to general economic conditions and regional conditions in each of the local market areas in which our stations operate 
we are also dependent to a significant degree on automotive related advertising 
approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant change in these advertising revenues in the future could materially affect our results of operations 
for a discussion of other factors that may affect our business  see risk factors 
competition one of the biggest challenges facing our industry today is the increase in competition for household audiences and advertisers 
advances in technology have offered audiences more choices for entertainment and information including cable tv  satellite  video on demand  videocassette recorders  personal video recorders  video games  internet and dvds 
advertisers are also presented with a variety of media in which to promote themselves and we compete for advertising dollars not only with local television stations in our market  but with other media including newspapers  radio  cable  outdoor and the internet 
for national sales  we compete with television broadcast networks and cable networks and print media 
we believe that our investment in digital television dtv is one way that will assist us in effectively competing with other media sources 
since dtv has the capacity for multiple channels  it would allow us to broadcast a combination of different channels with varying degrees of visual and sound quality  which would be of higher quality than present day television 
we could also provide interactive data services on these same channels 
since we have spent million in capital expenditures to complete our transition to digital and expect to incur another million during while  implementation of dtv will improve the technical quality of our over the air broadcast television it is possible that the conversion may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
we cannot predict the precise effect that converting to dtv will have on our business 
we believe local news drives audience viewership and ultimately increases market share 
therefore  to remain competitive we continue to invest in our local news operations through improved technology such as doppler radar  news editing systems and news helicopters 
news helicopters allow our stations access to the latest breaking news stories giving stations a competitive advantage over other stations in the market 
prior to  we had three helicopters serving our norfolk portsmouth newport news  va  indianapolis  in and austin  tx markets 
during  we acquired two additional helicopters 
one to serve our stations in puerto rico and one to be shared by the providence  ri new bedford  ma and hartford new haven  ct markets 

table of contents industry trends two significant industry wide factors influenced our performance during although historical market trends would have dictated a slight increase in revenue for  despite the loss of substantial political revenue in  the us advertising market experienced a significant slowdown during as evidenced by a decrease in market time sales for television as reported by the television bureau of advertising 
this was primarily the result of the war in iraq  which began in the first quarter of the market began to stabilize and showed signs of recovery towards the end of the year and we believe that the recovery will continue in also  political revenue is a factor when comparing our results for the three year period 
during an election year  political revenue makes up a significant portion of the increase in revenue in that year 
our results include the impact of additional advertising related to regional elections for governorships and congressional seats 
since is a presidential election year and political revenues during a presidential election year are generally higher than during a non presidential election year  we expect a large percentage of our revenue growth in to be attributable to political revenue 
significant other items impacting our results is an impairment charge of million reflected in operating expenses 
this charge reflects the write down of certain broadcast licenses resulting from a discounted cash flow forecast that uses industry averages to determine the fair value of the licenses 
the decrease in fair value is the result of the decline in the advertising market during and  which decreased industry wide station operation margins 
please refer to the critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements section below for more information regarding this impairment charge 
also during  we redeemed million of senior subordinated notes  repurchased million of our senior notes and issued million of senior subordinated notes and million of exchangeable senior subordinated debentures 
these new financings served to reduce our interest expense  which in turn  improved our liquidity from operations 
we incurred a million charge during related to this early extinguishment of debt 
in january  we repurchased million of our senior notes 
we incurred a million charge during the first quarter of related to this early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of this improvement in our capital structure we expect interest expense of approximately million in business combinations and dispositions we have developed our business through a combination of acquisitions  dispositions and organic growth 
we have acquired  or have agreements to acquire  and disposed of the following businesses and assets during on june   we sold the broadcast licenses and operating assets of krbc tv in abilene  texas and kacb tv in san angelo  texas for million in cash to mission broadcasting  inc on june   we acquired licenses in the mhz spectrum for million 
this spectrum can be utilized for any purpose other than analog television  but in any particular location cannot be used until vacated by incumbent broadcast licenses 
on august   we entered into an agreement with marantha christian network corporation to purchase the broadcast license and operating assets of wirs tv in yauco  puerto rico for million 
this acquisition was completed on january

critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our 
table of contents estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario  that excludes network compensation payments 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as required by sfas no 
 we completed a transitional impairment test for goodwill and broadcast licenses as of january  and also an impairment test as of december  as a result of these tests  an impairment of million million  net of tax benefit was recorded in the first quarter of to reflect the write down of certain broadcast licenses to their fair value 
we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses as of december  and as a result of this test an impairment of million was recorded to reflect the write down of certain broadcast licenses to their estimated fair value 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including  anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our business plans and overall expectations as to market and economic considerations 
network affiliations different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we used 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets between broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local 
table of contents television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the federal communication commission to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market 
the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  generally channels two to thirteen  are viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations  generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fourteen to sixty nine because these stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations and because of the inferior uhf signal in the early years of uhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city within a tri city market 
the audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee s local news programming and community involvement 
a local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming 
the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndication programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the number one station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on these factors or attributes listed above 
abc  fox  nbc  and cbs each have multiple affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
in connection with our purchase of sunrise television corp 
in may  we acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired in the sunrise transaction was based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in these specific markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
if we were to assign higher values to its acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to its broadcast licenses  it would have a significant impact on our operating results 
the following chart reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to 
table of contents network affiliations and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period assuming that this change would not impact the million impairment of broadcast licenses for the year ended december  percentage of total value reassigned to network affiliation agreements as reported balance sheet as of december  broadcast licenses other intangible assets  net including network affiliation agreements statement of operations for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets operating income loss from continuing operations net loss net loss per share in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from the sunrise acquisition values due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcast revenue during the financial statement period in which advertising is aired 
barter revenue is accounted for at the fair value of the assets or services received  or the advertising time surrendered  whichever is more clearly evident 
management judgment is required to determine which value is more clearly evident 
barter revenue is recorded at the time the advertising is broadcast  and barter expense is recorded at the time the assets or services are used 
we recognized barter revenue in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred barter expense in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  through disclosure only 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net loss if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation in thousands year ended december  in thousands  except share data net loss  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense  as reported  net of related tax effect deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effect pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per common share  as reported basic and diluted net loss per common share  pro forma allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when analyzing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical levels of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance net of allowances for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
amortization of program rights we charge program rights to operations over the estimated broadcast period of the underlying programs 
program rights are analyzed by management on an ongoing basis through a review of ratings  among other factors 
if the projected future net revenues is less than the current carrying value of the program rights due to poor ratings  we write down the program rights assets to equal the amount of projected future net revenues 
our program rights balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
our application of fin will result in the consolidation of the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of banks broadcasting  inc into our financial statements at their fair value determined at the date that the interpretation first applies  which for us is march   as it is not practicable for us to determine the carrying amount at such date 
the difference  if any  between the fair value of the newly consolidated assets over the reported amount of any previously held interests and the fair value of newly consolidated liabilities and non controlling interests shall be recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our investment in banks broadcasting  inc of approximately million as of december  we operate two television stations under local marketing agreements lma agreement 
an lma agreement is a contract between two separately owned broadcast licensees serving a common television 
table of contents market where the broadcast licensee lma operator of one station contracts with another broadcast licensee lma licensee to operate the lma licensee s broadcast license for an agreed upon schedule of cash payments 
under the lma agreement  the lma operator provides substantial portions of the programming for airing on the lma licensee s station and sells the advertising time associated with that programming 
the broadcast license of the lma station is subject to the ultimate programming and other controls exercised by the lma licensee 
the two lma licensees  with which we have lma agreements  hold the broadcast licenses and we hold the option to buy their broadcast licenses for approximately million 
in addition  these two lma licensees have limited operating costs associated with the management of those broadcast licenses 
we believe that the terms of our lma and related purchase option arrangements identify the entities owning the related broadcast licenses as variable interest entities vie under fin however  the purchase option arrangements do not oblige us to absorb the entities expected losses  if they occur  beyond the premium paid for such options 
we do not believe that these option premiums are significant in comparison to expected losses over the life of the broadcast licenses and  therefore  do not identify ourselves as the party that will absorb a majority of such expected losses 
we note that since march neither of our lma arrangements have put options 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that fin will require the consolidation of the entities owning the broadcast licenses 
our maximum exposure to loss is limited to approximately million  which represents the current premium paid in respect of the purchase options

in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   with the exception of certain provisions which the fasb has deferred

this statement requires additional disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to those in the original sfas no 
 however  it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
results of operations set forth below are the significant factors that contributed to our operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations from year to year are significantly affected by the impact of our acquisitions of sunrise television corporation sunrise in and wnlo tv  wnac tv  wjpx tv  wkpv tv and wjwn tv in as a result  our future reported financial results may not be comparable to the historical financial information and comparisons of any years may 
table of contents not be indicative of future financial performance 
our results of operations for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  change change to to numbers are in thousands national time sales local time sales political time sales agency commissions network compensation barter revenue other revenue net revenues operating costs and expenses direct operating excluding depreciation of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively selling  general and administrative amortization of program rights corporate restructuring charge depreciation and amortization of intangible assets impairment of broadcast licenses total operating costs and expenses operating income three year comparison net revenues net revenues consist primarily of national and local airtime sales  net of sales adjustments and agency commissions 
additional  but less significant  amounts are generated from network compensation  internet revenues  barter revenues  production revenues  tower rental income and carriage or retransmission agreements 
net revenues remained relatively flat at million for the year ended december  compared to net revenue of million for the prior year 
the parity in net revenue is due largely to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of net revenue for the year ended december  offset by a decrease in time sales due to the slowdown in the advertising market experienced during  beginning in the first quarter of with the outbreak of war in iraq 
the market began to stabilize and showed signs of recovery towards the end of the year and we believe that the recovery will continue in political revenues decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of the campaign election cycle 

table of contents net revenues increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is due to an increase in political revenue of million for the campaign election cycle and a general improvement in the advertising market of million 
included in these increases are the results of the sunrise acquisition  which contributed an additional million of net revenues for the year ended december  network compensation represents amounts paid to us for broadcasting network programming provided by cbs  nbc  and abc less amounts we pay to fox and the wb for broadcasting their network programming 
network compensation increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year largely due to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional  of network revenue 
network compensation increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the sunrise acquisition 
we currently have long term agreements with all of our nbc affiliates  our abc and cbs affiliation agreements are up for renewal at various points over the next two years 
if non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement occurs we could lose or experience a decrease in our network compensation 
operating costs and expenses direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets  consists primarily of news  engineering  programming and music licensing costs  increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of direct operating expenses 
our direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets at our stations other than the sunrise stations were relatively flat in as a result of savings associated with us centralizing our master control transmission facilities  which offset general cost increases in the market 
direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the sunrise acquisition that added million in direct operating expenses during selling  general and administrative expenses  consists primarily of employee salaries  sales commissions and other employee benefit costs  advertising and promotional expenses  increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
of the million change  million is the result of the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations 
the remaining increase is primarily due to a  increase in pension expense due to market conditions affecting our retirement funds and a  increase in property tax expense due to a combination of the addition of digital equipment and a general increase in tax rates 
we also experienced an increase in insurance expense of  due to general rate increases in the current insurance market and an increase of  in legal expenses primarily due to successful labor negotiations at several of our stations 
selling expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net revenue at  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
we experienced a million increase in selling costs during directly related to the increase in net revenue 
the remaining increase is primarily due to the sunrise acquisition 
amortization of program rights represents costs associated with the acquisition of syndicated programming  features and specials 
program rights are amortized over the estimated broadcast period of the underlying programs 
if the projected future net revenues from broadcast is less than the current carrying value of the program rights due to poor ratings  we would be required to write down the program rights assets to equal the amount of projected future net revenues 
amortization of program rights increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of 
table of contents amortization expense and million as a result of writing down several program rights due to lower future projections for those programs 
amortization of program rights decreased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this decrease is due to lower program costs of approximately million at wapa tv  in puerto rico  partially offset by an increase of million due to the sunrise acquisition 
corporate expenses  related to costs associated with the centralized management of our stations  increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
there was an increase in our pension expense of approximately  due to market conditions affecting our retirement funds   in directors and officers insurance expense  million in professional fees as a result of increased activities related to corporate governance and related compliance activities and  in due diligence expenditures related to potential acquisitions 
these increases are partially offset by a reduction in oversight and monitoring fees paid to hicks  muse  tate furst of approximately  and a reduction of  in management income from sunrise 
corporate expenses increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to additional pension expense of million due to market conditions affecting our retirement funds  an increase of  in directors and officers insurance expenses 
in addition  we incurred a compensation charge of  related to severance and retirement compensation for a senior executive  an additional bonus charge of  related to improved operating income and due diligence fees in connection with potential acquisitions of  in these increases were offset by a reduction in the hicks muse partners monitoring and oversight agreement fees of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is partially due to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense 
the remaining increase is the result of increased capital additions related to the digital conversion and maximization efforts and the clustering of our master control transmission facilities 
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and broadcast licenses and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million reflected in operating expenses 
this charge reflects the write down of certain broadcast licenses resulting from a discounted cash flow forecast that uses industry averages to determine the fair value of the licenses 
the decrease in fair value is the result of the decline in the advertising market during and  which decreased industry station operating margins 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the replacement of such amortization by periodic impairment testing

provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from a provision of million for the prior year 
the federal and state provisions for the year ended december  are primarily created by an increase in the valuation allowance against the increase in the company s net deferred tax asset position during the year 
the foreign provision for the year ended december  is primarily created as a result of foreign operating income for the year ended december  the provision for the year ended december  was primarily attributed to book income for the year and a charge of million to initially establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset position 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we record deferred tax liabilities relating to the difference in the book and tax basis of goodwill and intangibles 
prior to january   the reversals of those deferred tax liabilities were utilized to support the recognition of the deferred tax assets we recorded 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 those deferred tax liabilities no longer reverse on a scheduled basis and can no longer be utilized to support the realization of deferred tax assets 
our provision for income taxes increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to recording a non cash charge of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the quarter ended march  we reduced this valuation allowance  resulting in a reduction of the provision  to million as of december  the reduction was due to a corresponding decrease in deferred tax assets during the year ended december  we had net cash tax payments of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds for working capital have historically been cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities as well as funds from our initial public offering in may at december   we had cash of million and a million committed revolving credit facility of which million is outstanding at december   leaving million committed  but undrawn

the contingent interest equals per annum per  principal amount of debentures 
our capital expenditures primarily include purchases of broadcasting equipment  studio equipment  vehicles and office equipment to improve the efficiency and quality of our television broadcasting operations and may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including factors such as federal communication commission regulatory compliance expenditures and periodic maintenance requirements 
we do not currently have any committed capital expenditures for years beyond our capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

this decrease is the result of an increase in cash paid to employees of million  which is the result of million related to the sunrise acquisition  million related to the timing of salary and bonus payments and million due to a general market increase in the rates of compensation and benefits 
also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flow is an increase in cash paid for other operating expenses of million  which is primarily the result of the sunrise acquisition

net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the prior year

the change was also affected by the issuance of our initial public offering of common stock in  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year

table of contents mark to market adjustment required each quarter 
the value of these features on issuance of the debentures was million and this amount was recorded as an original issue discount and is being accreted through interest expense over the period to may the derivative features are recorded at fair market value in other liabilities 
we have recorded a gain on derivative instruments in connection with the mark to market of these derivative features of million for the year ended december  senior notes lin television corporation has outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due january  interest on these notes accrues at a rate of and is payable semi annually on january and july of each year 
lin television corporation may redeem some or all of these notes at any time on or after january  lin television corporation may also redeem up to of these notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before january  these senior notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all lin television corporation s existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all lin television corporation s existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
each of lin television corporation s direct and indirect  existing and future  domestic subsidiaries guarantee the senior notes on a senior basis

gecc note gecc provided debt financing in connection with the formation of our joint venture with nbc in the form of an million year non amortizing senior secured note bearing an initial interest rate of per annum 
during the last five years  the joint venture has produced cash flows to support the interest payments and to maintain minimum levels of required working capital reserves 
in addition  the joint venture has made cash distributions to us and to nbc from the excess cash generated by the joint venture of approximately million on average each year during the past three years 
accordingly  we expect that the interest payments on the gecc note will be serviced solely by the cash flow of the joint venture 
the gecc note is not our obligation  but is recourse to the joint venture  our equity interests therein and to lin tv corp  pursuant to a guarantee 
if the joint venture were unable to pay principal or interest on the gecc note and gecc could not otherwise get its money back from the joint venture  
table of contents gecc could require lin tv corp 
to pay the shortfall of any outstanding amounts under the gecc note 
if this happened  we could experience material adverse consequences  including gecc could force lin tv corp 
to sell the stock of lin television held by lin tv corp 
to satisfy outstanding amounts under the gecc note if more than of the ownership of lin television had to be sold to satisfy the gecc note  it could cause an acceleration of our senior credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness  or if the gecc note is prepaid because of an acceleration on default or otherwise  or if the note is repaid at maturity  we may incur a substantial tax liability 
the joint venture is approximately owned by nbc  and nbc controls the operations of the stations through a management contract 
therefore  the operation and profitability of those stations and the likelihood of a default under the gecc note are primarily within nbc s control 
factors that may affect future results risks associated with business activities our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues and  as a result  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns than businesses in other industries 
our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues 
the success of our operations depends in part upon factors beyond our control  such as national and local economic conditions  the availability of high profile sporting events  the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
in addition  we and those that we rely on for programming may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests in the markets 
we are dependent to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of shares of our common stock 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and approximately million of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  we will continue to have significant debt service obligations 

table of contents our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rates on certain of our borrowings  including amounts borrowed under our senior credit facilities  vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  our debt instruments require us to comply with covenants  including those that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures  that will restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our senior credit facilities 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million  million  and million for years ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of amortization and impairment of intangible assets and debt service obligations 
in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  or to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
we have a material amount of intangible assets  and if we are required to write down intangible assets in future periods  it would reduce net income  which in turn could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and the trading price of lin tv corp 
s class a common stock 
approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consists of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses  and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
sfas no 
also required us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test of our goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment 
in addition  we established a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets 
table of contents in the absence of the reversal of taxable temporary differences associated with goodwill and broadcast licenses amortization 
if at any point in the future the value of these intangible assets decreased  we would be required to incur an impairment charge that could significantly adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses at december  of million 
our strategy includes seeking growth through acquisitions of television stations  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of television stations with the goal of improving their operating performance by applying our management s business and growth strategy 
however  we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets 
future acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls  increase advertising revenues or increase audience share with respect to any acquired station 
in addition  our future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our business 
in addition  television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
broadcast interests of our affiliates  including hicks  muse  tate furst incorporated  may be attributable to us and may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of individuals affiliated with us are attributable to those individuals under fcc rules 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
the broadcast or other media interests of our officers  directors and or greater voting stockholders are generally attributable to us  which may limit our acquisition or ownership of television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of an otherwise nonattributable equity or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or newspaper in the same market 
as of december   affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst incorporated own  shares of lin tv class b common stock  which represents of lin tv s capital stock 
pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  non voting stock does not generally create an attributable interest 
as a result  due to the fact that affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst only own shares of lin tv class b common stock  we believe that none of our stations will be attributed to hicks  muse  tate furst and that no stations attributed to hicks  muse  tate furst will be attributed to us 
however  if affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst elect to convert their shares of class b common stock into either class a common stock or class c common stock of lin tv  under current fcc rules and regulations  the stations that are attributable to hicks  muse  tate furst would be attributed to us 
in addition  the fcc has stated that it reserves the authority  in an appropriate case  to declare as being attributable an unusual combination of otherwise nonattributable interests 

table of contents hicks  muse  tate furst and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in lin tv into a majority of its voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of other lin tv shareholders 
hicks  muse  tate furst and its affiliates have the ability to convert shares of lin tv s nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to the approval of the fcc 
if this occurs  affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst would own approximately of our voting equity interests in lin tv and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to lin tv shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
upon the conversion of the majority of the nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
the interests of hicks  muse  tate furst and its affiliates may differ from the interests of lin tv s other stockholders and hicks  muse  tate furst and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in your best interests 
for example  hicks  muse  tate furst is in the business of making significant investments in existing or newly formed companies and may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets  such as its existing investment in businesses like clear channel communications  inc  that may directly or indirectly compete with lin tv for advertising revenues 
hicks  muse  tate furst and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to lin tv s business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to lin tv 
in addition  affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst as the holders of lin tv s class b common stock  have the right to approve  among other things  the issuance or repurchase of any of lin tv s securities  the sale or acquisition of any asset or the incurrence of any indebtedness with a value of or more of the fair market value of our common equity securities of lin tv s  the merger or consolidation of lin tv with another company or any transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business 
hicks  muse  tate furst also has an assignable right  under certain conditions  to acquire the outstanding shares of lin tv s class c common stock 
moreover  royal w 
carson  iii and randall s 
fojtasek  two of lin tv s directors  together own all of lin tv s class c common stock and therefore possess of lin tv s combined voting power 
accordingly  messrs 
carson and fojtasek will have the power to elect the entire board of directors of lin tv and through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the lin tv stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions

if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  internet services  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view  digital video recorders  dvds and 
table of contents home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
in addition  as a result of the telecommunications act of  the legislative ban on telephone cable ownership has been repealed and telephone companies are now permitted to seek fcc approval to provide video services to homes 
it will be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hicks muse effectively determine whether a change of control will occur because of their rights through their ownership of all of the shares of our class b common stock or through their voting power  if they convert their shares of class b common stock into class a common stock or class c common stock 
moreover  provision of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power rights of our class c common stock held by messrs 
carson and fojtasek  make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hicks muse could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 
the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast network inserted commercials during that programming and often receive cash payments from networks  although in some circumstances  we make cash payments to networks 
in addition  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our affiliated stations  which would generally result upon the acquisition of of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hicks  muse  tate furst elect to convert the shares of lin tv class b common stock held by them into shares of either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our stations with network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required other broadcast groups  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network affiliation compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to affiliates on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation 
if this occurs  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
we are currently in negotiations with fox and telefutura regarding affiliation agreements with their networks 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  costs of gearing up a news operation  if necessary  and the cost of the equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network averages are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in the affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether it is a vfh or a uhf license  the quality and location of the license  the audience 
table of contents acceptance of the licensee s local news programming and community involvement and the quality of the other non network programming transmitted 
in addition  most of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news programming and syndicated product  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 
the use of an alternative method of valuing our network affiliations could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that are used by us 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
the attributes include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the federal communication commission to a particular market  the length of time that the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether the station is a vhf station or a uhf station  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within the market  the audience acceptance of the broadcast license s local news programming and community involvement  and the quality of non network programming carried by a station 
in connection with our purchase of sunrise television corp 
in may  we acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired in the sunrise transaction was based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in these specific markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  these broadcasting companies look beyond the specific contract value and include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing these network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of our other intangibles assets would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the depreciation and amortization 
table of contents of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and materially increase our net loss 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from the sunrise acquisition values due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
the general electric capital corporation note could result in significant liabilities and could trigger a change of control under our existing indebtedness  causing our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
general electric capital corporation  or gecc  provided debt financing for a joint venture between us and nbc  a sister corporation of gecc  in the form of an million  non amortizing senior secured note due in the event that such note is not extended or otherwise refinanced when the note matures in  we expect that  assuming current federal marginal tax rates remain in effect  our tax liability related to the joint venture transaction will be approximately million 
the formation of the joint venture was intended to be tax free to us 
however  any early repayment of the note will accelerate this tax liability  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  if an event of default occurs under the note  and gecc is unable to collect all amounts owed to it after exhausting all commercially reasonable remedies against the joint venture  including during the pendency of any bankruptcy involving the joint venture  gecc may proceed against lin tv to collect any deficiency  including by foreclosing on our stock and other lin tv subsidiaries  which could trigger the change of control provisions under our existing indebtedness 
annual cash interest payments on the note are approximately million 
there are no scheduled payments of principal due prior to  the stated maturity of the note 
the obligations under the note were assumed by the joint venture  and the proceeds of the note were used to finance a portion of the cost of hicks  muse  tate furst s acquisition of us 
the note is not our obligation nor the obligation of any of lin tv s subsidiaries and is recourse only to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interest in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to a guarantee 
an event of default under the note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled payment of interest  within days of the date due and payable  or principal of the note on the maturity date 
the joint venture has established a cash reserve of million for the purpose of making interest payments on the note when due 
both nbc and lin tv have the right to make a shortfall loan to the joint venture to cover any interest payment 
however  if the joint venture fails to pay principal or interest on the note  and neither nbc nor lin tv make a shortfall loan to cover the interest payment  an event of default would occur under the note and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount of the note upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited prior to its stated maturity 
we have paid penalties to the holders of our senior subordinated notes and exchangeable senior subordinated debentures and may be required to pay substantial penalties to the holders of our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures in the future 
in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreements relating to the issuance of our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures  we are required to pay substantial penalties to a holder of these debt instruments under specified circumstances  including  the failure to maintain an effective registration statement relating to the resale of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of the exchangeable senior subordinated exchangeable debentures for more than brief intervals 
these penalties are generally paid based on a percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness or a percentage of the value of the underlying class a common stock 
for example  in  we incurred  and  in penalty fees on our senior subordinated notes and 
table of contents exchangeable senior subordinated debentures  respectively  in connection with a delay in meeting required deadlines for the effectiveness of the registration statements relating to this debt 
risks related to our industry any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
during each of the three month periods ended march  and june   we experienced a loss of advertising revenue and incurred additional broadcasting expenses due to the initiation of military action in iraq 
the military action disrupted our television stations regularly scheduled programming and some of our clients rescheduled or delayed advertising campaigns to avoid being associated with war coverage 
we expect that if the united states of america engages in other foreign hostilities or there is a terrorist attack against the united states of america  we may lose additional advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to further pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and the increased costs of providing coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future  disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses has negatively affected  and could negatively affect in the future  our results of operations 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we may be exposed in the future to increased programming costs which may adversely affect our operating results 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in write offs that increase station operating costs 
recently enacted campaign finance legislation and pending election law reform proposals may substantially limit political advertising  upon which we heavily rely 
recently enacted campaign finance legislation restricts spending by candidates  political parties  independent groups and others on political advertising and imposes significant reporting and other burdens on political advertising 
the legislation became effective in november the legislation could have the effect of diminishing the amount of advertising spent on broadcast television stations and altering the timing of those expenditures 
we are unable to predict the impact on our business of the new legislation or the timing or outcome of any federal election commission determinations 
changes in fcc ownership rules through commission action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue operating stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently operate under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of our two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
these restrictions include a rule prohibiting one company from owning broadcast television stations with service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
the restrictions also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in medium and smaller markets and two stations in larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 

table of contents in two recent decisions  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit found three of the fcc s decisions with respect to three of its ownership rules  including the national television ownership cap  the television duopoly rule and a prohibition on ownership of television broadcast stations and cable systems in the same market to be arbitrary and capricious 
the court vacated the cable television cross ownership rule and remanded the national cap and television duopoly rule to the commission for further action 
on june   the fcc voted substantially to amend many of its ownership rules 
the fcc raised the national television ownership limit from to 
the television duopoly rule was relaxed to permit ownership of up to three stations in certain large markets and two stations in many mid sized markets  provided that no more than one of the co owned stations can be among the top four in audience share in the market 
in addition  the newspaper television cross ownership prohibition was restricted to smaller markets those with fewer than four television stations 
a new local cross ownership regulation was adopted which precludes ownership of certain combinations of television and radio stations and newspapers in markets with fewer than nine television stations 
with respect to the television duopoly rule  the commission declared that it would grant waivers of the top four restriction under certain circumstances 
it also held that two station combinations which were not in conformance with the amended rule  eg  where both stations were among the top four stations in the local markets in audience share  would not have to be divested 
however  the commission also determined that a non conforming combination could not be transferred jointly either as a separate asset or through the transfer of control of the licensee  except by obtaining a waiver of the rule upon each transfer or by sale to certain eligible small business entities 
the commission also determined that it would continue to grandfather local marketing agreements entered into prior to november   such as our local marketing agreements in austin  texas  and providence  rhode island  until the conclusion of a further ownership review rulemaking to be initiated in  which would address the question of whether and under what circumstances the agreements would be permitted to continue 
the amended rules were to become effective in september   but at the request of various parties which filed judicial appeals challenging the commission s actions  a three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit  which has been selected as the appellate court to hear the consolidated appeals  stayed the effectiveness of the new rules until it has issued a decision 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of that decision or whether the decision will be subject to further judicial appeals 
in addition  several parties  including the company  filed petitions for reconsideration with the commission asking for a variety of amendments to the amended rules  eg  eliminating the non transferability of grandfathered cross ownership interests 
finally  on january  president bush signed an omnibus appropriation bill which provides that the national ownership cap would be fixed by statute at an aggregate reach of of us households 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these regulatory  judicial or legislative proceedings 
should the new rules become effective  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the new television duopoly rule become effective  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin  texas  and providence  rhode island  which we currently operate under local marketing agreements and which are subject to purchase option agreements entered into by our subsidiaries 
any such acquisition would be subject to the amended duopoly rule s restriction on ownership of more than one top four station in a market 
should we have to seek a waiver of the new rule in either case because the second station is among the top four in audience share  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining it 
should a waiver be required and obtained  or should we succeed in elevating to top four audience status the second station in any of the other markets in which we currently have two stations  we will be unable to transfer that two station combination  either through an asset transfer or a transfer of control of us or the applicable licensee subsidiary  without grant of another waiver or sale to an eligible small business entity 
moreover  should we be unable to obtain a waiver  there is no assurance 
table of contents that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond the conclusion of the rulemaking 
in we had net revenues of million  or  of our total net revenues  attributable to those local marketing agreements 
changes in technology may impact our long term success and ability to compete 
the fcc has adopted rules for implementing advanced television  commonly referred to as digital television  in the united states of america 
our conversion to digital television requires additional capital expenditures  which we anticipate will be approximately million in  and operating costs 
implementation of digital television will improve the technical quality of over the air broadcast television 
it is possible  however  that conversion to digital operations may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
we believe that digital television is essential to our long term viability and the broadcast industry  but we cannot predict the precise effect digital television might have on our business 
the fcc has levied fees on broadcasters with respect to non broadcast uses of digital channels  including data transmissions or subscriber services 
further advances in technology may also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
we are unable to predict the effect that technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or the future results of our operations 
inflation we believe that our businesses are affected by inflation to an extent no greater than other businesses generally
