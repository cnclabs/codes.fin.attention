seasonal nature of business nstar electric kilowatt hour sales and revenues are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring and fall as sales tend to vary with weather conditions 
nstar gas sales are positively impacted by colder weather because a substantial portion of its customer base uses natural gas for space heating purposes 

refer to the selected consolidated quarterly financial data section in item  selected consolidated financial data for specific financial information by quarter for and competitive conditions the electric and natural gas industries  in general  have continued to change in response to legislative  regulatory and marketplace demands for improved customer service at lower prices 
these pressures have resulted in an increasing trend in the industry to seek efficiencies and other benefits through business combinations 
nstar was created to operate in this marketplace by combining the resources of its utility subsidiaries activities in the transmission and distribution of energy 

table of contents environmental matters nstar s subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal  state and local standards with respect to the management of wastes  air and water quality and other environmental considerations 
these standards could require modification of existing facilities or curtailment or termination of operations at these facilities 
they could also potentially delay or discontinue construction of new facilities and increase capital and operating costs by substantial amounts 
noncompliance with certain standards can  in some cases  also result in the imposition of monetary civil penalties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview nstar or the company is an energy delivery company engaged primarily in the transmission and distribution of energy 
nstar serves approximately million customers in massachusetts  including approximately million electric customers in communities and million gas customers in communities 
nstar is a public utility holding company generally exempt from the provisions of the public utility holding company act of nstar s retail utility subsidiaries are boston edison company boston edison  commonwealth electric company comelectric  cambridge electric light company cambridge electric and nstar gas company nstar gas 
its wholesale electric subsidiary is canal electric company canal 
nstar s three retail electric companies operate under the brand name nstar electric 
reference in this report to nstar shall mean the registrant nstar or one or more of its subsidiaries as the context requires 
reference in this report to nstar electric shall mean each of boston edison  comelectric and cambridge electric 
nstar s non utility  unregulated operations include district energy operations advanced energy systems  inc and nstar steam corporation  telecommunications operations nstar communications  inc nstar com and a liquefied natural gas service company hopkinton lng corp utility operations accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenues in  and nstar generates its revenues primarily from the sale of energy  distribution and transmission services to customers and from its unregulated businesses 
however  nstar s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in unit sales of kwh and mmbtu  which directly determine the level of distribution and transmission revenues recognized 
in accordance with the regulatory rate structure in which nstar operates  its recovery of energy costs are fully reconciled with the level of energy revenues currently recorded and  therefore  do not have an impact on earnings 
as a result of this rate structure  any variability in the cost of energy supply purchased will impact purchased power and cost of gas sold expense but will not affect the company s earnings

table of contents any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date of this filing and nstar undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult all further disclosures nstar makes in its filings to the sec 
also note that nstar provides in the above paragraphs a cautionary discussion of risks and other uncertainties relative to its business 
these are factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from expected and historical performance 
other factors in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect nstar 
this report also describes material contingencies and critical accounting policies and estimates in this section and in the 
accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  and nstar encourages a review of these notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates nstar s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
nstar believes that its accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the reported results of operations  cash flows and financial position are described below 
a 
revenue recognition utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the mdte and ferc 
estimates of distribution and transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
the determination of unbilled revenues requires management to estimate the volume and pricing of electricity and gas delivered to customers prior to actual meter readings 
revenues related to the sale  transmission and distribution of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters that are read on a systematic basis throughout the month 
meters which are not read during a given month are estimated and trued up in a future period 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last billing date are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled electric revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes territory load  estimated line losses and applicable customer rates 
unbilled natural gas revenues are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated gas losses and tariffed rates in effect 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
nstar s non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
the level of unbilled revenues is subject to seasonal weather conditions 
electric sales volumes are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring or fall 
gas sales volumes are 
table of contents impacted by colder weather since a substantial portion of nstar s customer base uses natural gas for heating purposes 
as a result  nstar records a higher level of unbilled revenue during the seasonal periods mentioned above 
b 
regulatory accounting nstar follows accounting policies prescribed by gaap  the ferc and the mdte 
as a rate regulated company  nstar s utility subsidiaries are subject to the financial accounting standards board  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of sfas results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries 
nstar s energy delivery businesses remain subject to rate regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application of sfas this ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets based on the probability of current and future cash inflows 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded regulatory assets of billion and billion  respectively 
this decrease is primarily the result of the collection of regulatory generation related assets secured by securitization certificates and costs to achieve the merger from customers and retiree benefit costs as a result of a lower additional minimum liability adjustment 
nstar continuously reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
nstar expects to fully recover these regulatory assets in its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  nstar would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
however  impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
regulatory assets related to the generation business are recovered through the transition charge 
c 
derivative instruments power contracts typically  the electric power industry contracts to buy and sell electricity under option contracts  which allow the buyer some flexibility in determining when to take electricity and in what quantity to match fluctuating demand 
these contracts would normally meet the definition of a derivative requiring mark to market accounting 
however  because electricity cannot be stored and utilities are obligated to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the electricity needs of its customer base  an option contract for the purchase of electricity typically qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception described in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and derivative implementation group dig issue no 
c  scope exceptions normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity 
nstar electric has long term purchased power agreements that are used primarily to meet its standard offer obligation 
the majority of these agreements are above market but are not reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
however  in issue c  the dig concluded that contracts with a pricing mechanism that are subject to future adjustment based on a generic index that is not specifically related to the contracted service commodity generally would not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
nstar has six purchased power contracts that contain components with pricing mechanisms that are based on a pricing index  such as the gross national product or consumer price index 
although these factors are only applied to certain ancillary pricing components of these agreements  as required by the interpretation of dig issue c  nstar began recording these contracts at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets during as a result  the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the above market portion of these contracts at december  is approximately million and is reflected as a 
table of contents component of deferred credits power contracts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model and a discount rate 
the market value assumption used was provided by a third party who determines such pricing for the new england power market 
had management used an alternative assumption  the value of these contracts at december  would have changed significantly 
a one percent increase or decrease to the discount rate would change the above market value by approximately million from what is presently recorded 
nstar electric recovers all of its electricity supply costs  including the above market costs from customers 
for these six purchased power agreements  the recovery of its above market costs occurs through for boston edison  through for comelectric and through for cambridge electric 
these recovery periods coincide with the contractual terms of these purchased power agreements 
therefore  in addition to the liability recorded  nstar also recorded a corresponding regulatory asset representing the future recovery of these actual costs 
as a result  any changes to the fair value of these contracts will not have an effect on nstar s earnings 
d 
pension and other postretirement benefits nstar s pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
there were no significant changes to nstar s pension plan benefits in  and that had a significant impact on recorded pension costs 
as further described in note h to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  nstar revised the discount rate in to from in to reflect market conditions 
in addition  nstar revised the expected long term rate of return on its pension plan assets for to  reduced from in these changes will have a significant impact on reported pension costs in future years in accordance with the cost recognition approach of sfas described above 
this impact will be mitigated through nstar s regulatory accounting treatment of pension and pbop costs 
see further discussion of regulatory accounting treatment below 
in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  these assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
nstar s pension plan the plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  were affected by significant declines in the financial markets from through despite positive investment performance during fluctuations in market returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of the plan at both december  and  and therefore  will also impact pension costs for 
table of contents the following chart reflects the projected benefit obligation and cost sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
in thousands impact on projected benefit impact on cost actuarial assumption change in assumption obligation increase decrease pension increase in discount rate basis points decrease in discount rate basis points increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate basis points decrease in discount rate basis points increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na na not applicable nstar s discount rate is based on rates of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies and through periodic bond portfolio matching 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  nstar considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
in  nstar reduced the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to as a result of the prevailing outlook for equity market returns 
this rate is presented net of both administrative expenses and investment expenses  which have averaged approximately for both and nstar pays both types of expenses for the plan 
reported pension costs increased in and will likely increase in and future years as a result of this changed assumption 
however  as a result of the mdte order the order discussed below  this increase will not have an impact on nstar s results of operations 
the unfavorable market conditions from through impacted the value of plan assets 
as a result of this negative investment performance and  despite the positive investment performance in  the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded plan assets at both december  and the abo represents the present value of benefits earned without considering future salary increases 
since the fair value of its plan assets is less than the abo  nstar is required to record this difference as an additional minimum pension liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
under sfas  nstar is also required to eliminate its prepaid pension balance 
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment is equal to the sum of the minimum pension liability and the prepaid pension that would be recorded  net of taxes  as a non cash charge to other comprehensive income oci on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the fair value of plan assets and the abo are measured at each year end balance sheet date 
the minimum liability will be adjusted each year to reflect this measurement 
at such time that the plan assets exceed the abo  the minimum liability would be reversed 

table of contents on october   the mdte approved nstar s request for a reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism related to pension and pbop costs 
as part of this ruling  which effectuated a mdte accounting order  nstar is allowed to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to oci for the additional minimum liability requirement for under funded benefit plans 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded a regulatory asset of million and million  respectively 
the regulatory asset is shown as part of deferred debits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of while not required to make contributions to the plan  nstar anticipates that it will contribute approximately million to the plan in nstar believes it has adequate access to capital resources to support these contributions 
e 
decommissioning cost estimates the accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will not affect nstar s results of operations or cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through nstar s transition charge filings with the mdte 
while nstar no longer directly owns any nuclear power plants  nstar electric collectively owns  through its equity investments  of connecticut yankee atomic power company cyapc  of yankee atomic electric company yaec  and of maine yankee atomic power company  the yankee companies 
periodically  nstar obtains estimates from the management of the yankee companies on the cost of decommissioning the connecticut yankee nuclear unit cy  the yankee atomic nuclear unit ya  and the maine yankee nuclear unit my 
these nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities 
based on estimates from the yankee companies management as of december   the total remaining cost for decommissioning each nuclear unit is approximately as follows million for cy  million for ya and million for my 
of these amounts  nstar electric is obligated to pay million towards the decommissioning of cy  million toward ya  and million toward my 
these estimates are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as power contract liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset and do not impact the current results of operations 
these estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the yankee companies regarding future costs 
nstar expects the yankee companies to seek recovery of these costs and any additional increases to these costs in rate applications with the ferc  with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors  including nstar electric 
nstar electric would recover its share of any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge 
asset retirement obligations on january   nstar adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations under lease arrangements 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present 
table of contents value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
nstar has identified certain immaterial long lived assets  including obligations under lease and easement arrangements  and has determined that it is legally responsible to remove such property 
for its regulated utility businesses  nstar has identified legal retirement obligations that are currently not material to its financial statements 
the recognition of a potential asset retirement obligation will have no impact on its earnings 
in accordance with sfas  for nstar s rate regulated utilities  nstar would establish regulatory assets or liabilities to defer any differences between the liabilities established for ratemaking purposes and those recorded as required under sfas for nstar s regulated utility businesses  cost of removal negative net salvage is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment 
cost of removal was previously included in accumulated deprecation but is currently reflected as a regulatory liability in conjunction with the adoption of sfas as of december  and  the estimated amount of the cost of removal included in regulatory liabilities was approximately million and million  respectively  based on the cost of removal component in current depreciation rates 
nstar has also identified several long lived assets  in which it has legal obligations to remove such property  for its non regulated businesses 
based on current information and assumptions  nstar  in the first quarter of  recorded an increase in non utility property of approximately million  an asset retirement liability of approximately million and a cumulative effect of adoption after tax  reducing net income by million in the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded as part of depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
new accounting standards in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas also amends sfas for implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on nstar s financial position or results of operations

accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement is intended to improve the accounting for these financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
this statement requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet 
nstar adopted sfas effective july  nstar assessed the requirements of the statement and has not identified any financial instruments to which sfas applies 
in addition  nstar has not entered into  nor modified  any financial instrument since may  as a result  the implementation of this statement has not had an impact on nstar s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in june  the derivatives implementation group dig  a working group of the fasb  issued dig no 
c  scope exceptions interpretation of the meaning of not clearly and closely related in paragraph b regarding contracts with a price adjustment feature  which clarified the interpretation of clearly and closely related contracts that include price adjustments 
this interpretation also established transition guidance for those contracts that had previously met the normal purchases and sales exception under previous guidance but may not meet the scope exception under this interpretation 
for nstar  the effective date of dig issue no 
c was october  nstar has assessed the impact of this interpretation on its current derivative contracts and has determined that nstar will continue to designate these contracts as derivative financial instruments and will mark to market their values at each reporting date 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended and revised in december fin r  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vie s by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
application of this interpretation is required for all potential vie s that are referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and  for all other types of entities that are potential vie s that are not referred to as special purpose entities  the consolidation requirements apply for periods ending after march  nstar has assessed the impact of fin r and has determined that it does not have any vie s for which nstar is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation of the entity as of december  for all other types of entities  nstar is still assessing the impact that fin r will have on its consolidated financial position 
nstar has a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  bec funding llc  established to facilitate the sale and administration of million in notes to a special purpose trust created by two massachusetts state agencies 
historically  nstar has consolidated this entity 
as part of nstar s assessment of fin r  nstar reviewed the substance of this entity to determine if it is still proper to consolidate this entity 
based on its review  nstar has concluded that bec funding llc is a variable interest entity and should continue to be consolidated by nstar

this premium will continue to be amortized over years and amounts to approximately million annually  while the costs to achieve cta are being amortized over years 
cta are the costs incurred to execute the merger including the employee costs for a voluntary severance program  costs of financial advisers  legal costs  and other transaction and systems integration costs 
cta was being amortized at an annual rate of million based on the original rate plan  as approved by the mdte through the rate freeze period 
effective upon completion of the four year rate freeze on august   the amortization expense was increased to reflect the actual cta expenditures incurred 
as a result  the total cta amortization expense for was approximately million  an increase of million over nstar will reconcile the actual cta costs incurred with the original estimate in a future rate proceeding 
this reconciliation will include a final accounting of the deductibility for income tax purposes of each component of cta 
the total cta is approximately million 
this increase from the original estimate is partially mitigated by the fact that the portion of cta that is not deductible for income tax purposes is approximately million lower than the original estimate 
nstar anticipates that these incremental costs are probable of recovery in future rates 
the cta and goodwill amounts were filed and approved as part of the rate plan

service quality indicators service quality indicators are established performance benchmarks for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance  customer satisfaction  and reliability and safety performance for all massachusetts utilities 
nstar electric and nstar gas are required to report annually to the mdte concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent of transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks 
on february   nstar electric and nstar gas filed their service quality reports with the mdte that reflected significant improvements in reliability and performance  the reports indicate that no penalty was assessed for the mdte concurred with nstar s determination in an order issued on september  nstar monitors its service quality continuously to determine its contingent liability  and if it were determined that a liability has been incurred and is estimable  an appropriate liability would be accrued 
annually  each nstar utility subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the mdte 
any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period an agreement is reached with the mdte 

table of contents as of december   nstar electric s and nstar gas performance has exceeded the applicable established benchmarks such that no liability has been accrued for c 
retail electric rates electric distribution companies in massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through either standard offer or default service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier 
currently  standard offer service is scheduled to be available to eligible customers through february at prices approved by the mdte 
the delivery rates and the standard offer service are set at levels so as to guarantee mandatory overall rate reductions required by the massachusetts electric restructuring act of restructuring act 
currently  new retail customers in the nstar electric service territories and other customers who are no longer eligible for standard offer service and have not chosen to receive service from a competitive supplier are provided default service 
default service rates are reset every six months every three months for large commercial and industrial customers 
the price of default service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for power 
nstar anticipates that upon the expiration of standard officer service  effective march   all customers will be eligible for default service 
however  massachusetts officials are considering new deregulation legislation to be effective after march  nstar cannot predict or anticipate the outcome of this process or its impact on nstar or its customers 
as of december  and  customers of nstar electric had approximately and  respectively  of their load requirements provided by competitive suppliers 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of transition  transmission  standard offer and default service costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective january  the filings were updated in february to reflect final costs and revenues which are subject to final reconciliation 
on november   boston edison received approval of a settlement agreement with the massachusetts attorney general ag from the mdte resolving issues in boston edison s reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year this settlement had minimal impact to boston edison s results of operation 
effective september   boston edison s  comelectric s and cambridge electric s standard offer service fuel adjustment sosfa rates were modified upon approval by the mdte 
the mdte has allowed companies to adjust prices to reduce deferred cost balances that arise due to rapidly changing market costs for the oil and natural gas used to generate electricity and the sosfa is designed to collect the costs of fuel that companies incur for purchasing electricity from their suppliers to serve their standard offer service customers 
the boston edison sosfa was reduced to zero while the comelectric and cambridge electric sosfas were increased to cents per kilowatt hour 
these changes followed an increase in this rate adjustment from zero to cents per kilowatt hour that was effective may  for all three nstar electric companies 
the sosfa was at zero from april  through april  for all three nstar electric companies 
the mdte has ruled that these fuel index adjustments are excluded from the rate reduction requirement under the restructuring act 
effective january   nstar electric s sosfa rates were modified again with the approval of the mdte 
the boston edison sosfa remained at zero per kilowatt hour 
the comelectric and cambridge electric sosfa were reduced to cents per kilowatt hour 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of transition  transmission  standard offer and default service costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric 
table of contents subsidiary effective january  the filings were updated in february to include final costs and revenues for on november   boston edison received approval of a settlement agreement with the ag from the mdte resolving issues in boston edison s reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year among other issues  the settlement agreement included an adjustment for the reconciliation of costs related to securitization and efforts to mitigate costs incurred in relation to a purchased power agreement with hydro quebec 
as a result of this settlement agreement with the ag  boston edison recognized approximately million in additional transition charge revenues in this benefit was significantly offset by several other regulatory true up adjustments

standard market design smd prior to march   independent system operator new england iso ne dispatched generating units based on the lowest operating costs of available generation and transmission 
under this structure  generators were required to provide iso ne with market prices at which they sell short term energy supply 
for each participant actively involved in the power market  the imbalance in energy provided by a participant and the energy consumed by such participant in each hour is settled at a single real time clearing hourly price for such power 
pursuant to orders issued by the ferc in september and december of  these markets were further restructured into smd  which began on march  smd provides an additional market in which wholesale power costs can be hedged a day in advance through binding financial commitments 
also  under smd  wholesale power clearing prices vary by location  called load zones  with prices in load zones with less efficient generation being higher than in load zones with more efficient generation while transmission constraints prevent the lower cost generation from moving from one load zone to another 
nstar electric covers two of the eight load zones in new england northeastern ma nema and southeastern ma sema 
nema is import constrained and sema is export constrained 
at times nema has higher priced generation than sema 
as part of smd  load serving entities  like nstar electric  were granted proceeds from the auction of financial transmission rights that is conducted by iso ne 
nstar electric can either use these proceeds to mitigate costs to customers directly or transfer them to the suppliers of its energy resource needs to reduce the cost to customers 
further developments in the movement towards smd will occur in with the introduction of a capacity requirement within load zones by load serving entities lse  like nstar electric 
the current market structure allows capacity  located within all of new england  to count towards a lse s obligation 
since the new england market as a whole is currently in a surplus position  capacity trades at a relatively low price 
pursuant to ferc orders  iso ne is developing a new structure that will require lse to provide a portion of their capacity needs within the zone where load is served 
this will likely increase the price of power to nstar s customers 
these market rules are in development and must be approved by the ferc  currently scheduled for mid until these rules are finalized and approved  nstar cannot anticipate the impact these charges will have on nstar and its customers 
e 
regional transmission organization rto on october   the iso ne  responsible for the day to day operations of new england s bulk generation and transmission systems  together with the utility companies that own transmission facilities in new england  filed a proposal with ferc creating a rto in compliance with ferc directives and pronouncements 
it is anticipated that ferc will act on this proposal by march  
table of contents an rto is intended to be an independent entity  without a financial interest in the region s marketplace  that would have operating authority over the new england transmission grid and have the responsibility to make impartial decisions on the development and implementation of market rules 
under the iso s current proposal  the iso ne will be transformed into an rto through a change of name and governance structure  designed to ensure independence from market participants 
the new rto will enter into a series of contractual arrangements that will define its functions and responsibilities  including a transmission operating agreement  which will govern the relationship between the owners of transmission facilities  such as nstar transmission owners to and the rto  as the operator of the new england transmission grid 
separate agreements will govern the operation of the spot power and related markets  and merchant transmission facilities 
notwithstanding broad agreement between the iso ne and tos on the allocation of their respective rights and responsibilities  there remain certain issues  particularly regarding the authority to make tariff filings and liability and indemnification obligations of the parties  which have not been fully resolved and may require ferc adjudication 
while the rto proposal has the support of the iso ne and the tos  the new england power pool recently declined to support the proposal by a substantial margin 
the chairman of the mdte has voiced support for the concept of an rto  while the massachusetts attorney general has voiced skepticism about the benefits of the proposed rto 
the ferc effort encouraging the voluntary formation of an rto is itself under attack nationally from opposition groups  primarily in the south and west 
nstar generally supports the rto proposal  which delineates the roles and responsibilities of tos and the rto in grid operation and potentially may increase the return earned on its investment in transmission related assets 
management cannot estimate the impact of this proposal on the company at this time

natural gas industry restructuring and rates nstar gas generates revenues primarily through the sale and or transportation of natural gas 
gas sales and transportation services are divided into two categories firm  whereby nstar gas must supply gas and or transportation services to customers on demand  and interruptible  whereby nstar gas may  generally during colder months  temporarily discontinue service to high volume commercial and industrial customers 
sales and transportation of gas to interruptible customers do not materially affect nstar gas operating income because substantially the entire margin on such service is returned to its firm customers as rate reductions 
in addition to delivery service rates  nstar gas tariffs include a seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause cgac and a local distribution adjustment clause ldac 
the cgac provides for the recovery of all gas supply costs from firm sales customers or default service customers 
the ldac provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers 
the cgac is filed semi annually for approval by the mdte 
the ldac is filed annually for approval 
in addition  nstar gas is required to file interim changes to its cgac factor when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
due to the increase in wholesale natural gas prices  nstar gas was allowed by the mdte to increase its winter seasonal cgac factor effective november  by over the prior winter season s factor 
the cgac factor was allowed to increase two additional times during that winter season due to the increases in the wholesale cost of gas 
on november   the winter season cgac factor was set at a level higher than the average for the prior winter season due to higher wholesale gas costs 
on january   the cgac factor was allowed to increase by to reflect an additional increase in the cost of gas 
in the last three years  the winter season cgac factor was revised upward to reflect increases in the cost of gas caused by varying market conditions 
to date  the cgac factor for the winter of has ranged from per therm to  in the winter of  the cgac 
table of contents ranged from per therm to per therm  the range for the winter of was per them to per therm 
other legal matters in the normal course of its business  nstar and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters  including civil litigation 
management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible court ordered damages  settlement amounts  and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance 
based on the information currently available  nstar does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liability will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in estimates could have a material impact on its results of operations for a reporting period 
rcn abandonment on december   nstar exited its investment in rcn and formally abandoned its million shares of rcn common stock 
as a result  nstar recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million  or per share 
nstar determined that the abandonment at that time was the most tax efficient  cost effective and expedient means to exit its rcn investment 
nstar determined other alternatives such as a sale of the shares would be less beneficial as a result of the number of shares held by nstar  the trading value in shares of rcn common stock  the potential negative impact that a large volume of sales of rcn common stock could have on the value of such shares  the length of time required to exit such investment through a sale of such shares and the fact that no block purchasers expressed an interest in purchasing such shares 
nstar determined that the benefit of a tax realization event at that time and in that manner outweighed any benefit that it would likely realize from any other alternative  including the future sale of such shares in an orderly fashion consistent with all laws  rules and regulations 
as a result of this abandonment  the investment was written down to zero as of december  the cumulative increase in fair value of these shares since december   including the impact of the abandonment charge for these shares  is included in other comprehensive income  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
income tax issues a 
tax valuation allowance sfas  accounting for income taxes  prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
nstar had determined that it was more likely than not that a current or future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the write downs of its rcn investment that were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of and previously in the first quarter of these write downs resulted from the significant declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector  including rcn 
as a result of this uncertainty  nstar recorded a million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit associated with these write downs 
during and  as a result of previously unanticipated capital gain transactions  nstar recognized million and million  respectively  of this tax benefit 
additionally  based on the internal revenue service irs review of nstar s and federal income tax returns  nstar determined that it was more likely than not that it would ultimately recognize the tax benefits relating to the incremental operating losses from the joint venture that were allocated to nstar 
the returns are currently being audited by the irs as part of their normal review of nstar s consolidated federal income tax returns 
the tax valuation allowance included reserves related to the tax treatment of these losses through june   
table of contents the final date of jv loss allocation to nstar 
each of the tax returns filed for through claimed operating losses 
the tax return filed for claimed the remaining portion of these operating losses 
based on the irs examining agent s review  no adjustment for the years under audit was proposed 
this determination was arrived at in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  nstar applied the treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent basis  allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of approximately million as a reduction to income tax expense included as a component of the write down to the rcn investment 
on december   nstar exited from its investment in rcn and formally abandoned the million shares of rcn common stock 
as mentioned above  a tax valuation allowance had been established in a previous year to offset the potential future tax benefits resulting from write downs of nstar s investment in rcn 
as a result of the abandonment  the company will claim an ordinary loss on its tax return 
this treatment results in the company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write downs of this investment for financial reporting purposes 
the requirement for a tax valuation allowance  therefore  no longer exists 
as a result  the company reduced the remaining valuation allowance to zero at december  however  the company expects the irs to review this transaction and it is reasonably possible that the irs will disagree 
as a result  the company established a loss contingency reserve of approximately million at december  b 
tax gain on generating assets the cost of transitioning to retail open access was mitigated  in part  by the sale of commonwealth energy system s com energy now a wholly owned subsidiary of nstar non nuclear generating assets 
com energy completed the sale of substantially all of its non nuclear generating assets in proceeds from the sale of these assets amounted to approximately million  or times their book value of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale  net of book value  transaction costs and certain other adjustments amounted to million and are required to be used for the benefit of com energy customers under mdte rate setting policies 
in this instance  the amount was used to reduce transition costs of cambridge electric and comelectric related to electric industry restructuring 
com energy determined that this transaction was not a taxable event because it did not provide an economic benefit to its shareholders 
in order to complete its audit of com energy s tax returns for the years  and  the irs needed to determine whether this transaction was taxable 
the local irs examining agent filed a request for technical advice with its national office on june  on august   nstar received a response from the irs national office to a request for technical advice  requesting advice as to whether the gain on the sale of com energy s non nuclear generating assets in was a taxable transaction 
the technical advice memorandum upheld com energy s position 
this ruling now completes the audits by the irs of com energy s   and federal income tax returns 
this decision did not require the company to make tax and interest payments to the irs of approximately million 
results of operations the following section of md a compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended december   and and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents compared to earnings and operations overview earnings per common share were as follows years ended december  change basic diluted net income was million for compared to million for three factors that contributed to the million  or  increase in earnings include increased retail electric and firm gas sales of and  respectively  as compared to  interest savings on the company s outstanding indebtedness due to lower short term and long term interest and a lower level of borrowing in  as well as a reduction in the impairment charges related to nstar s investment in rcn corporation rcn from to nstar was able to achieve the earnings growth despite an increase in operation and maintenance expenses 
the primary factor for the million increase in these expenses from was higher benefit costs 
these costs were somewhat mitigated  effective september   as a result of a mdte order  which allowed the company to defer approximately million through december  in increased pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
see 
critical accounting policies and estimates  
pension and other postretirement benefits  in this md a for more information on the mdte order 
from a cash flow perspective  nstar generated cash from operations sufficient to fund approximately million of net capital expenditures and approximately million of cash dividends 
in comparison to the prior year  cash from operations decreased primarily due to the timing of the collection of energy costs  increased contributions to nstar s pension and pbop plans and an increase in energy costs 
the company s capital expenditures contributed to nstar s solid operational performance in reliability  restoration  and customer service measurements 
these measurements are reflected in nstar s mdte service quality indicator filings  which indicated that no penalties would be incurred by nstar for both and cash expended for financing activities primarily reflect the payment of debt service requirements and dividends to shareholders 
energy sales and weather the following is a summary of retail electric and firm gas energy sales for the years indicated years ended december  change retail electric sales mwh residential commercial industrial other total retail sales 
table of contents years ended december  change firm gas sales bbtu residential commercial industrial and other total firm sales the increase in retail mwh sales in reflects  by customer sectors  an improvement of in residential and in commercial offset somewhat by the continued sales decline of in the industrial sector 
the increase in firm gas sales in primarily reflects an improvement of in the residential sector 
in terms of customer sectors  industrial sales are less sensitive to weather while residential and commercial sales are influenced by temperature extremes 
in addition to unseasonably cold winter weather and cool spring and summer conditions in  the increase in sales is attributable in part to further home and commercial building and expansion of existing units and the resulting extension of residential and commercial energy uses 
residential and commercial customers were approximately and  respectively  of nstar s total retail sales mix for and provided and of distribution revenues  respectively 
industrial sales are primarily influenced by national and global economic conditions and sales to these customers declined in primarily due to a slowdown in economic conditions that led to reduced production or facility closings 
nstar forecasts its electric and gas sales based on normal weather conditions 
actual results may differ from those projected due to actual weather conditions above or below normal weather levels  and other factors 
refer to cautionary statement in this section 
unit sales of electricity in are expected to grow at approximately to 
firm gas sales are expected to remain flat or decrease by up to 
normal year average heating degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average weather conditions impact electric and  to a greater extent during the winter  gas sales in nstar s service area 
the first quarter of was significantly colder than the same period in  followed by continued below normal temperatures for the second and third quarters  and warmer than prior year and normal conditions by and in the fourth quarter of  respectively 
the comparative information above relates to heating and cooling degree days for and and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by a year average 
a degree day is a unit measuring how much the outdoor mean temperature falls below heating degree day or rises above cooling degree day a base of degrees 
each degree below or above the base temperature is measured as one degree day 

table of contents operating revenues operating revenues for increased from as follows in millions increase decrease amount percent electric revenues retail distribution and transmission energy  transition and other total retail wholesale total electric revenues gas revenues firm and transportation energy supply and other total gas revenues unregulated operations revenues total operating revenues electric revenues electric retail distribution revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the company s recovery of its capital investment  including a return component  and operation and maintenance related to its electric distribution infrastructure 
the transmission revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the electricity over high voltage lines from the generator to the company s substations 
the increase in retail revenues primarily reflects the increase in retail mwh sales 
retail electric revenues also include approximately million in carrying charges on the company s average net prepaid pension and pbop balances  as allowed under an order from the mdte in nstar s largest earnings sources are the revenues derived from distribution rates approved by the mdte 
the level of distribution revenues is affected by weather conditions and the economy 
weather conditions affect sales to nstar s residential and small commercial customers 
economic conditions affect nstar s large commercial and industrial customers 
energy  transition and other revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs incurred by the company in order to acquire the energy supply on behalf of its customers and a transition charge for recovery of the company s prior investments in generating plants and the costs related to long term power contracts 
the energy supply revenues relate to customers being provided energy supply under either standard offer or default service 
energy supply contract prices vary among the nstar electric companies and for standard offer and default service customers 
however  the retail revenues related to standard offer and default services are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on nstar s consolidated net income 
furthermore  energy and transition revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 
other revenues primarily relate to the company s ability to effectively reduce stranded costs mitigation incentive and rental revenue from electric property 
wholesale revenues relate to services provided to municipalities and certain other governmental authorities 
this decrease in wholesale revenues reflects the expiration of two wholesale power supply contracts in and three other contracts during after october   nstar electric will no longer have contracts for the supply of wholesale power 
amounts collected from wholesale customers are credited to retail customers through the transition charge 
therefore  the expiration of these contracts will have no impact on results of operations 
in october  a 
table of contents municipal wholesale electric contract will expire resulting in a further decline in wholesale revenues and sales 
gas revenues firm and transportation gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for nstar gas recovery of costs of its capital investment in its gas infrastructure  including a return component  and for the recovery of costs for the ongoing operation and maintenance of that infrastructure 
the transportation revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the natural gas over pipelines from gas suppliers to take stations located within nstar gas service area 
the million increase in firm and transportation revenues is attributable to the increase in energy sales due to the significantly colder winter weather  and additional customers 
firm gas revenues also include approximately million in carrying charges on the company s average net prepaid pension and pbop balances  as allowed under an order from the mdte in nstar gas sales are positively impacted by colder weather because a substantial portion of its customer base uses natural gas for space heating purposes 
energy supply and other gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs to the company in order to acquire the natural gas in the marketplace and a charge for recovery of the company s gas supplier service costs 
this revenue increase of million primarily reflects the higher costs of gas supply that reflected a weighted average cost of gas per therm increase over of approximately 
these revenues are fully reconciled with the cost currently recognized by the company and  as a result  do not have an effect on the company s earnings 
unregulated operations revenues unregulated operations revenues are derived from nstar s businesses that include district energy operations  telecommunications  and liquefied natural gas service 
unregulated revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in unregulated revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the rates for electric and chilled water services and higher steam revenues resulting from the significantly colder weather and higher fuel costs 
operating expenses purchased power costs were  million for compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily the result of increased sales and the higher costs of fuel  partially offset by the recognition of million relating to the deferred standard offer and default service supply costs for current period under collection of these costs 
nstar electric adjusts its rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
due to the rate adjustment mechanisms  changes in the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on earnings 
the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  was million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to recognition of the higher costs of gas supply and the significant increase in sales 
nstar gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of gas supply contracts  transportation contracts on interstate pipelines  market area storage and peaking services 
however  these expenses are also fully reconciled to the current level of revenues collected 

table of contents operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase primarily reflects a higher overall level of pension and pbop costs of approximately million 
this increase was somewhat mitigated  effective september   as a result of a mdte order  which allowed nstar to defer approximately million through december  of the increased pension and other postretirement benefits expense 
refer to rate and regulatory proceedings in this md a for further discussion 
this increase was partially offset by the reduction in operations and maintenance expense in connection with improvements made in electric distribution services in and overall cost reduction initiatives in also  bad debt expense increased by million due to higher retail revenue 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily reflects the absence in of million in accelerated amortization of regulatory assets associated with the seabrook generating unit sale in  partially offset by higher depreciable plant in service 
dsm and renewable energy programs expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  which are consistent with the collection of conservation and renewable energy revenues 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the mdte and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to higher overall municipal property taxes of million caused primarily by higher property assessments  capital additions and tax rates in the city of boston  partially offset by lower payroll charges 
income taxes attributable to operations were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  reflecting higher pre tax operating income in and the absence of tax benefits related to the sale of the seabrook generating unit in  which reduced income tax expense by approximately million in other income  net other income  net was million in compared to million in  a decrease in other income of million 
the decrease in income was due primarily to the absence of million in gains realized in on the sale of demutualized insurance company common shares and the recognition of investment tax credits of million as a result of the sale of the seabrook generating unit in  offset by the incremental benefit recognized related to deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recognized in of approximately million 
also  in  other income  net includes the sale of blackstone station that resulted in a pretax gain of million 
other deductions  net other deductions  net  including write down of rcn investment  net  were million in and million in excluding the million and the million write downs of the rcn investment in and  other deductions in amounted to million 
the million increase in other deductions in was due primarily to the rcn abandonment charge of million pre tax 
offsetting this increase was the absence in of a million accrual for shutdown costs recorded in for the northwind district energy facility for expected equipment removal costs 

table of contents interest charges interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase in interest expense primarily reflects the impact of the october  boston edison issuance of million of year debentures and million of year floating rate debentures priced at three month libor plus basis points at december  
also  contributing to this increase was comelectric s issuance of a million variable rate at december  term loan on may  these new debt issuances increased interest expense by million in partially offsetting these increases was the absence in of million in interest due to boston edison s early redemption of its million debentures in september and its million debentures retired in march and scheduled repayments of its transition property securitization certificates of million that resulted in reduced interest expense of million 
securitization interest represents interest on debt collateralized by the future income stream associated primarily with the stranded costs of the pilgrim unit divestiture 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
short term and other interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to both lower borrowing rates and a lower average level of short term debt outstanding that averaged million and million in and  respectively 
interest rates on these borrowings averaged and for and  respectively 
the increase in long term debt interest expense and the decrease in short term debt interest expense is primarily due to the fact that nstar has refinanced some short term debt with long term debt in order to take advantage of favorable interest rates 
allowance for funds used during construction capitalized interest increased million  or  primarily due to a higher average balance of construction work in progress during the year due to the construction of new combustion turbines at aes matep facility 
compared to earnings and operations overview earnings loss per common share were as follows years ended december  change basic nm diluted nm nm not meaningful net income was million  or and per basic and diluted common share  respectively  for earnings for include non cash  after tax charges of million  or per basic and diluted common share related to nstar s investment in rcn that is further discussed below 
for  nstar reported a loss of million of per basic and diluted common share 
results for were million  or per basic and per diluted common share  and excludes a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per basic share  related to nstar s investment in rcn 
absent rcn charges in both years  earnings increased by million per share  or  primarily due to increased mwh and firm gas sales and transportation and favorable adjustments related to regulatory orders  lower preferred dividend requirements and interest 
table of contents savings offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance reflects higher pension and other postretirement benefits expenses and increased maintenance on the electric system in connection with the system improvement program 
cash flows from operations increased by over million due to the higher level of earnings  improved accounts receivable collections  lower regulatory cost deferrals  and income tax payments 
other positive factors during included lower bad debt expense of million and a million deferred tax benefit resulting from an adjustment to nstar s tax valuation allowance 
nstar s return on equity was despite the downturn in the economic environment 
nstar and subsidiaries maintained their credit ratings with all rating agencies 
in addition  nstar increased its common dividend rate by or per share to on an annual basis 
capital spending in significantly exceeded the prior year s level due to an increase in the allocation of critical capital resources to improve electric system reliability and customer service 
as a result of this spending  key electric and gas operating performance results were greatly improved in over those of electric customer outrage hours were reduced by and the length of those outages was reduced by 
these dramatic improvements were accomplished during record breaking summer heat and an unprecedented demand for electricity 
also contributing to this increase was additional capital spending related to nstar s non regulated subsidiaries  primarily advanced energy system s generation expansion project 
on june   nstar received an additional million shares from the third and final exchange of its investment in the rcn joint venture pursuant to an amended joint venture agreement 
the market value of rcn common shares continued to decline during and did not close above nstar s previously adjusted carrying value of per share since november  as a result  nstar recognized impairment charges totaling million  reducing the carrying value of its million rcn shares to per share as of december  these charges were offset by the recognition of million in tax benefits relating to joint venture operating losses 
combined  the impairment charges and tax benefits amounted to million  or per share in similarly  in  due to a significant decrease in the market value of rcn common shares  nstar recorded a non cash  after tax charge of million 
management determined that these declines in market value were other than temporary in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
operating revenues operating revenues for decreased from as follows in thousands retail electric revenues wholesale electric revenues gas sales revenues other revenues decrease in operating revenues the decrease in operating revenues was significantly impacted by the decline in standard offer and default service rates charged to customers beginning in january that reflected lower purchased power and gas costs 
retail electric revenues were  million in compared to  million in  a decrease of million  or 
the change in retail revenues includes the significantly lower cost of purchased energy supply discussed below that contributed to the lower rates implemented in january  april and july for standard offer and default services 
components of the total decrease in retail revenues includes lower revenues attributable to 
table of contents standard offer and default services of million and million  respectively  lower revenue related to demand side management and renewable energy programs of million due to the reconciliation of program costs  an increase in incentive adjustments and the timing of program expenditures 
transition revenues increased by million due to higher rates for transition cost recovery offset by an million decline in mitigation incentive revenues that are allowed for successfully lowering transition charges 
mitigation incentive revenues will continue to decrease over the transition period extending over time from through transmission revenues increased by million primarily as a result of rate increases and the absence in of a million reduction in revenues that reflected an mdte approved transmission reconciliation filing 
the change in nstar s retail revenues related to standard offer  default services and demand side management and renewable energy are reconciled to the costs incurred 
the increase in retail mwh sales in reflects  by customer sectors  an improvement of in residential and in commercial offset somewhat by the continued sales decline of in the industrial sector 
the overall increase in sales is attributable to the warmer summer period  as compared to the prior year 
was the tenth warmest year in years 
however  the economic downturn continued to have a negative impact on sales as indicated by the high boston office vacancy rate 
business spending continued to be depressed as firms were reluctant to commit to increased employment and expansion of office space 
the unemployment rate in boston was approximately through december as compared to approximately in the same period in nstar electric s sales to residential and commercial customers were approximately and  respectively  of its total retail sales mix for and provided and of total revenues  respectively 
industrial sales declined due primarily to a slowdown in economic conditions that led to reduced production or facility closings 
the industrial and other retail sales sector comprised approximately of nstar s energy sales and of distribution revenue 
the first quarter of was significantly warmer than the same period in  followed by slightly below normal temperatures for the second quarter  above normal temperatures in the third quarter and colder than prior year and normal conditions in the fourth quarter of below is comparative information on heating and cooling degree days for and and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by a year average 
normal year average heating degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average the heating degree days experienced during were virtually the same level with heating degree days in however  in the first quarter of  heating degree days totaled  a decline of from the prior year of  and below a normal level of  heating degree days for the fourth quarter were  an increase of as compared to and greater than normal 
the warmer than normal conditions in early significantly impacted earnings for gas operations due to the relatively short winter period when there is potential heating demand 

table of contents the higher cooling degree days experienced during positively impacted electric distribution revenues 
the above normal cooling degree days impacted air conditioning usage of our customers and resulted in higher electric distribution revenues than would otherwise have been recorded during a more moderate summer period 
electric wholesale revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in wholesale revenues reflects the expiration of two municipal power supply contracts on may   and another municipal contract on october   and a decline in rates due to the lower cost of purchased power 
amounts collected from wholesale customers are credited to retail customers through the transition charge 
therefore  the expiration of these contracts has no impact on results of operations gas sales revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decline in the cost of gas from suppliers compared to the same period in  slightly offset by a increase in firm energy sales 
other revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from non utility operations due to lower steam sales that reflect warmer weather during the early part of  lower billing rates  and the loss of a large customer  partially offset by higher chilled water revenues due to the warmer summer period and higher demand rates 
operating expenses purchased power costs were  million in compared to  million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in expense reflects a decline in prices of natural gas and oil and a decrease in wholesale sales due to the expiration of three municipal power supply contracts 
partially offsetting the impact of these decreases was a increase in retail electric sales and an increase in transmission costs 
included in and was million and million  respectively  that related to the recognition of previously deferred standard offer and default service supply costs resulting from the current period collection of previously deferred costs 
nstar adjusts its electric rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a reconciling basis 
due to the rate adjustment mechanism  a change in the amount of energy supply expense does not have an impact on earnings 
the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  reflecting the lower cost of gas supply and the significant reduction in sales due to milder weather conditions in the first quarter of these expenses are also reconciled to the current level of revenues collected 
operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase primarily reflects incremental expenditures incurred relating to improvements to nstar s electric delivery system that were substantially completed as of september   an increase of approximately million and million in pension related and postretirement benefits expense net of amounts capitalized  respectively  resulting primarily from a downturn in the equity market and a million loss incurred that related to an insurance settlement adjustment 
the increase in pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs continued through  as a result of the declines in the equity markets over the past three years 
these factors were somewhat offset by the absence of million in storm costs incurred in the first quarter of and a decline in bad debt expense of million 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to increases in capital spending during in connection with system reliability improvements as well as the accelerated amortization of regulatory assets associated with the seabrook sale of approximately million 
this increase was offset by the absence of depreciation on nstar s district energy facility  northwind in in  northwind s assets were written down by million 
dsm and renewable energy program expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  primarily due to a reduction of dsm programs which is consistent with the collection of conservation and renewable energy revenues 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the mdte and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
in addition  nstar earns revenue incentive amounts in return for increased customer participation 
in and  these incentives amounted to approximately million 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to higher tax rates and assessments  particularly for the city of boston of million offset by lower payments in lieu of taxes to the town of plymouth under nstar s agreement with the town 
income taxes from operations were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of tax benefits relating to certain customer refunds  which reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
in addition  this decrease also reflects the tax benefit of deducting nstar s common dividends paid to the nstar saving plan 
these items resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for to from for other income  net other income was million in compared to million in  an increase in income of million 
the increase was due primarily to million in accelerated amortization of itc resulting from the sale of seabrook  deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments of million  a million net increase in interest income primarily related to a reversal of a previously established interest reserve and the absence in of million related to system development costs 
other income in also reflects million related to transaction fees 
other deductions  net other deductions were million in both and in deductions in reflect the absence of a million accrual for shutdown costs recorded in for the northwind district energy facility as compared to million in for an additional charge for expected equipment removal costs and a million decline in expense for the minority interest related to this facility 
other deductions also include increased charitable contributions of million  offset by million in lower miscellaneous deductions  including applicable income tax benefits for total other deductions 
interest changes interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense reflects the retirement of million of boston edison s debentures in august  boston edison s early redemption of debentures of million in september  nstar gas series i bonds of million in december  cambridge electric s series d notes of million in june and comelectric s million term 
table of contents loan in january  additional sinking fund payments and the reduction in transition property securitization certificates outstanding of million that resulted in reduced interest expense of million 
securitization interest represents interest on debt collateralized by the future income stream associated with the stranded costs of the pilgrim unit divestiture 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was the impact of the october  boston edison issuance of million of year debentures and million of year floating rate debentures in priced at three month libor plus basis points 
the net proceeds were used to repay consolidated outstanding short term debt 
these new debentures increased interest expense by million in short term and other interest expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to a million increase in the carrying charges associated with reductions in the level of under collection of regulatory deferrals  particularly carrying charges related to deferred transition costs 
short term and other interest costs reflected a significant reduction in borrowing rates and a million lower average level of debt outstanding in  that resulted in an interest savings of approximately million 
short term borrowing rates averaged approximately in as compared to approximately in partially offsetting this decrease in short term expense was a million increase in interest costs associated  for the most part  with now resolved tax matters 
the decrease in afudc is primarily due to a reduction in the afudc rate reflecting the overall decline in short term debt rates 
the rate was compared to in also contributing to this decrease was the absence in the current period of capitalized interest on the construction of nstar s corporate office facility of approximately million 
these reductions were partially offset by higher capital project balances during primarily as a result of electric system infrastructure upgrades 
liquidity and capital resources during  and  internal generation of cash provided  and  respectively  of plant expenditures 
internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating activities  adjusted to exclude changes in working capital and the payment of dividends 
nstar companies supplement internally generated funds as needed  primarily through the issuance of short term commercial paper and bank borrowings 
the capital spending level currently forecasted for is million  consisting of approximately million for electric and gas operations and million for capital requirements of non utility ventures 
the capital spending level over the following four years is currently forecasted to aggregate approximately  million 
management continuously reviews its capital expenditure and financing programs 
these programs and  therefore  the forecasts included in this form k are subject to revision due to changes in regulatory requirements  operating requirements  environmental standards  availability and cost of capital  interest rates and other assumptions 
nstar s primary estimated uses of cash for include capital expenditures  dividend payments and debt reductions 
nstar has long term debt principal payments  minimum lease commitments  electric capacity charge obligations under contracts and natural gas contractual agreements at december  for each of the years presented below 
table of contents in millions years thereafter long term debt transition property securitization leases electric capacity obligations gas contractual obligations operating activities in provided million of cash 
the company used million in its investing activities  primarily to fund million of plant expenditures  which included system reliability infrastructure improvement projects incurred by nstar electric and nstar gas operations and expenditures in connection with the advanced energy systems  inc generation expansion project 
operating activities 
the net cash provided by operating activities of million was partially attributable to net income of million  which  when adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and investment tax credits  provided million of cash as compared to million in from net income as similarly adjusted 
deferred income taxes and investment tax credits increased by million reflecting the deferred tax impact of a change in the tax laws that allows for an additional acceleration of tax depreciation on additions and amortization of investment tax credits 
despite the increase in earnings  the decline in operating cash flows in compared to was due primarily to the million received in as part of the completion of a development project and approximately million in increased contributions to nstar s qualified pension plan in nstar currently anticipates that it will contribute approximately million to its pension plan and approximately million to its other postretirement benefit plans in in addition to these factors  the timing of the recovery of energy costs reduced operating cash flows by million in in comparison to these energy costs will be recovered with a carrying charge from customers in future periods 
there is no impact on earnings from the timing of the recovery of energy costs 
changes in other working capital items were primarily caused by the decrease in accounts receivable due to energy billings and the timing of tax payments 
net working capital 
net working capital components  reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows and exclude short term borrowings and the current portion of long term debt  decreased by million to a negative working capital position of million for as compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable resulting from the buildup of energy billings during due to higher rates in effect at that time and collection of these billings in and an increase in accounts payable of million due to the timing of energy supply invoices 

table of contents investing activities 
the net cash used in investing activities in of million consists primarily of capital expenditures related to transmission and distribution systems and the expansion of nstar s advanced energy systems  inc generating facility offset by million in net proceeds received from the sale of blackstone station 
financing activities 
the net cash used in financing activities of million reflects long term debt redemptions and sinking funds payments of million  dividends paid of million  a higher level of short term borrowings of million and the proceeds from the issuance of a million three year term loan 
nstar has commenced the regulatory filing process to obtain approval to construct a kv transmission line from the southern suburbs of boston to south boston in order to assure continued reliability of service and improve power input capacity in the northeast massachusetts area nema 
if approved  construction is estimated to begin in the fourth quarter of and the new transmission line is anticipated to be placed in service during the summer of this project is a regional transmission investment and  as a result  the cost will be shared by all of new england 
this proposed plan is subject to siting and license requirements 
short term financing activities 
nstar s short term debt increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from the refinancing by boston edison in october of short term debt with the proceeds of long term debt 
in may  comelectric used the proceeds of its million financing to reduce short term debt levels 
in  nstar s short term debt decreased million primarily as a result of the use of proceeds from boston edison s million financing completed in october to refinance short term debt 
on january   boston edison gave notice to the trustee for its debentures that the entire million aggregate principal amount of its debentures due march  will be called for redemption on march  at a price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
as a result  this debenture is included under current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  in may  comelectric entered into a million  three year variable rate unsecured term loan with a group of banks 
the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding short term debt balances 
additionally  in  debt financing activities included the retirement of million in securitization certificates  million for the redemption of boston edison s debentures in march  comelectric s million term loan also in march and other scheduled sinking fund payments 
in  debt financing activities included the retirement of million in securitization certificates  comelectric s million term loan in january  cambridge electric s million series d notes in june and million for the early redemption of boston edison s debentures in september 

table of contents sources of additional capital and financial covenant requirements nstar and boston edison have no financial covenant requirements under their respective long term debt arrangements 
comelectric  cambridge electric and nstar gas have financial covenant requirements under their long term debt arrangements and were in compliance at december  and nstar s long term debt other than the mortgage bonds of nstar gas is unsecured 
the transition property securitization certificates held by boston edison s subsidiary  bec funding  llc  are collaterized with a securitized regulatory asset with a balance of million as of december  boston edison  as servicing agent for bec funding  collected million in these collected funds are remitted daily to the trustee of bec funding 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
nstar has a credit facility of million that consists of a three year  million revolving credit agreement that expires on november  at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under these revolving credit agreements 
the million credit facility serves as a backup to nstar s million commercial paper program that  at december  and  had million and million outstanding  respectively 
in october  following receipt of the proceeds of boston edison s million debt issue  the proceeds were used to pay down short term debt balances 
under the terms of this credit agreement  nstar is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than at all times  excluding transition property securitization certificates  and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity  and to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than to for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount 
at december  and  nstar was in full compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants 
in december  boston edison filed a shelf registration with the sec to allow boston edison to issue up to million in debt securities 
the registration went effective on january   but the issuance of debt securities pursuant to the shelf registration is still subject to approval by the mdte 
as of december   no amounts were issued under this shelf registration 
boston edison has approval from the ferc to issue short term debt securities from time to time on or before december   with maturity dates no later than december   in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed million at any one time 
boston edison has a million revolving credit agreement that expires on november  at december   there was no amount outstanding under this revolving credit agreement 
these agreements serve as backup to boston edison s million commercial paper program that had a million balance at december  and no outstanding balance at december  in october  following receipt of the proceeds of its million debt issue  its short term debt balance was reduced to zero 
under the terms of this agreement  boston edison is required to maintain a maximum total debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than at all times  excluding transition property securitization certificates  and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity  and to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than to for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
at december  and  boston edison was in full compliance with all of its covenants in connection with its short term credit facilities 
in addition  comelectric  cambridge electric and nstar gas  collectively  have million available under several lines of credit and had million and million outstanding under these lines of credit at december  and  respectively 
comelectric and cambridge 
table of contents electric have ferc authorization to issue short term securities from time to time on or before november  and june   with maturity dates no later than november  and june   respectively  in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed million and million  respectively  at any one time 
nstar gas is not required to seek approval from ferc to issue short term debt 
historically  nstar and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available  as indicated above  at favorable rates and terms to finance its external cash requirements 
however  the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and nstar s or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit ratings 
an adverse change in nstar s or its subsidiaries credit ratings or market conditions could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions upon which nstar or its subsidiaries have access to capital markets 
nstar has no financial guarantees  commitments  debt or lease agreements that would require a change in terms and conditions  such as acceleration of payment obligations  as a result of a change in its credit rating 
however  nstar s subsidiaries could be required to provide additional security for power supply contract performance  such as a letter of credit for their pro rata share of the remaining value of such contracts 
refer to performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements and financial and performance guarantees further discussed below 
nstar s goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity 
based on nstar s key cash resources available as discussed above  management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected requirements 
other events on october   nstar electric initiated the process to auction off certain power purchase agreements under which the company had contracted to purchase approximately  megawatts of power under long term contracts with non utility generators 
the auction is intended to further nstar s efforts to mitigate stranded costs  which continue to be recovered from customers 
any sale or restructuring of the power purchase agreements would serve to fix and or reduce costs that are currently collected from customers 
currently  nstar electric cannot predict the timing and outcome of this auction nor the ultimate impact on its financial position or cash flows 
nstar electric does not expect an impact to earnings since the proceeds would be used to lower costs that are passed through to customers in rates 
on july   mirant corporation and certain of its subsidiaries mirant filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
mirant currently supplies  among other services  standard offer service for approximately of nstar electric s standard offer load 
should mirant fail to perform under this agreement  nstar electric would be required to seek replacement energy supply to meet its standard offer obligation 
nstar s current expectation is that mirant will continue to perform under its agreements with nstar  and  as a result  nstar does not expect the mirant bankruptcy to have a material impact to its earnings or cash flows 
performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements nstar electric has contracted with a third party supplier to provide of its standard offer service supply obligations through december  in addition  nstar electric has entered into a number of short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire default service supply obligation  other than large customers  for the period january  through june  and 
table of contents for of its obligation  other than large customers  for the second half of nstar electric has entered into a number of short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire default service supply obligation for large customers through march these agreements are for a term of three to twelve months 
nstar electric currently is recovering payments it is making to suppliers from its customers 
all of nstar electric s power suppliers are subsidiaries of larger companies with investment grade or better credit ratings 
in accordance with nstar s internal credit policy  and to minimize nstar electric risk in the event the supplier encounters financial difficulties or otherwise fails to perform  nstar has financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place with the parent company of the supplier 
in addition  under these agreements  in the event that the supplier or its parent guarantor fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating  it is required to provide additional security for performance of its obligations 
nstar electric s policy is to enter into power supply arrangements only if the supplier or its parent guarantor has an investment grade or better credit rating 
in view of current volatility in the energy supply industry  nstar electric is unable to determine whether its suppliers or their parent guarantors will become subject to financial difficulties  or whether these financial assurances and guarantees are sufficient 
in the event the supplier or its guarantor does not provide the required additional security within the required time frames  nstar electric may then terminate the agreement 
in such event  nstar may be required to secure alternative sources of supply at higher or lower prices than provided under the terminated agreements 
some of these agreements include a reciprocal provision  where in the event that an nstar electric distribution company receives a credit rating below investment grade  that company could be required to provide additional security for performance  such as a letter of credit 
virtually all of nstar gas firm gas supply agreements are short term less than one year and utilize market based  monthly indexed pricing mechanisms so the financial risk to the company would be minimal if a supplier were to fail to perform 
however  in the event that a firm supplier does fail to perform under its firm gas supply agreement pricing provisions  the company would be entitled to any positive difference between the monthly supply price and the cost of replacement supplies 
the cost of gas procured for firm gas sales customers is recovered through a semi annual cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
under mdte regulations  interim adjustments to the cost of gas may also be requested if market volatility causes swings in the price of gas 
nstar gas continually evaluates the financial stability of current and prospective gas suppliers 
firm suppliers are required to have and maintain investment grade credit ratings and the firm gas supply agreements allow either party to require financial assurance  or  if necessary  contract termination in the event that either party is downgraded below investment level and is unable to provide financial assurance acceptable to nstar gas 
financial and performance guarantees on a limited basis  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties 
such agreements include letters of credit  surety bonds  and other guarantees 
at december   outstanding guarantees totaled million as follows in thousands letters of credit surety bonds other guarantees total guarantees 
table of contents the million letter of credit is for the benefit of a third party  as trustees in connection with the notes of one of nstar s subsidiaries 
the letter of credit is available if the subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements 
as of december   there have been no amounts drawn under this letter of credit 
as of december   certain of nstar s subsidiaries have purchased a total of million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses  permits and rights of way in various municipalities 
in addition  nstar has purchased approximately million in workers compensation self insurer bonds 
these bonds support the guarantee by nstar to the commonwealth of massachusetts required as part of nstar s workers compensation self insurance program 
nstar and its subsidiaries have also issued million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the hydro quebec transmission companies 
management believes the likelihood nstar would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote 
preferred stock dividends and redemptions preferred dividends of boston edison were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on december   boston edison redeemed all  shares outstanding of its cumulative preferred stock  series  at the mandatory redemption price of per share  plus accrued dividends 
contingencies environmental matters as of december   nstar s subsidiaries are involved in state regulated properties massachusetts contingency plan  or mcp sites where oil or other hazardous materials were previously spilled or released 
the nstar subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise remediate these properties in accordance with specific state regulations 
there are sometimes uncertainties associated with total remediation costs due to the final selection of the specific cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the different sites 
estimates of approximately million and million are included as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
in addition to the mcp sites  nstar subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of involvement in multi party disposal sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation 
nstar generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites 
estimates of approximately million are included as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and the mcp and multi party disposal site amounts have not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of these costs or any potential recovery from nstar s insurance carriers 
prospectively  should nstar be allowed to collect these specific costs from customers  it would record an offsetting regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal to previously expensed costs 
nstar gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of five former manufactured gas plant mgp sites and alleged mgp waste disposal locations to determine if and to what extent 
table of contents such sites have been contaminated and whether nstar gas may be responsible for remedial action 
the mdte has approved recovery of costs associated with mgp sites over a year period  without carrying costs 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded a liability of approximately million and million  respectively  as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several mgp sites for which nstar gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible party 
a corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that reflects the future rate recovery for these costs 
estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or nstar s responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved 
nstar s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates 
based on nstar s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  nstar does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position or results of operations for a reporting period 
employees and employee relations as of december   nstar had approximately  employees  including approximately  or  who are represented by three units covered by separate collective bargaining contracts 
local of the utility workers union of america  afl cio  represents approximately  employees with a contract that expires on may  approximately employees represented by local  united steelworkers of america  afl cio clc  have a contract that expires on march  approximately employees of advanced energy systems matep subsidiary are represented by local  international union of operating engineers  afl cio  with a contract that expires on september  management believes it has satisfactory relations with its employees 
interest rate risk nstar is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily based on levels of short term debt outstanding 
the weighted average interest rates for long term indebtedness  including current maturities were and in and  respectively 
carrying amounts and fair values of long term indebtedness excluding notes payable  including current maturities as of december  and  were as follows carrying fair carrying fair in thousands amount value amount value long term indebtedness including current maturities as discussed in the following section  nstar s exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although nstar has material commodity purchase contracts  these instruments are not subject to market risk 
nstar s electric and gas distribution subsidiaries have rate making mechanisms that allow for the recovery of fuel costs from customers 
customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric distribution businesses at standard offer prices through february the cost of providing standard offer service includes fuel and purchased power costs 
default service is the electricity that is supplied by the local distribution company when a customer is not receiving power from standard offer service 
the market prices for standard offer and default service may fluctuate based on the average market price for power 
amounts collected through standard offer and default service are recovered on a fully reconciling basis 
in addition  nstar s exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
on may   commonwealth electric company entered into a million  three year variable rate unsecured term loan with a group of banks priced at libor plus basis points 
an immediate change of one percent on this term loan would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million per year 
on october   boston edison issued million of year floating rate debentures priced at libor plus basis points 
an immediate change of one percent for these variable rate debentures would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million per year
