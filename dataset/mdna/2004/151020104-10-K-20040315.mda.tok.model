item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are an integrated global pharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases 
we currently market thalomid  our lead product  for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum enl  which is more widely used off label for treatment in multiple myeloma and other cancers 
despite dosage decreases over the past several years  thalomid sales have grown rapidly as the number of patients using thalomid has increased steadily 
the success of thalomid has enabled us to invest heavily in research and development spending  which has resulted in a broad portfolio of products in the our discovery pipeline 
moreover  using years of clinical data generated through the study of thalidomide  we have developed a promising pipeline of thalomid analogs eg  imids tm 
these compounds have been optimized to have the beneficial attributes of thalidomide while having minimized its negative attributes and side effects 
revlimid tm  one of our clinical stage imids  is now being tested in ongoing pivotal phase iii special protocol assessment trials and phase ii trials that have the potential to result in fda approval in given revlimid s potentially superior safety and efficacy profile  its higher profitability projections and the leverage we can achieve from our established oncology salesforce  we expect the launch of revlimid to result in a significant growth to our bottom line 
we believe that the success of thalomid  the growth opportunities of revlimid and a broad portfolio of products coupled with our solid cash position  places us in a good position within the biotechnology industry 
industry wide factors future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones and our ability to control costs 
for further discussion about risks  refer to risk factors contained in part i  item i of this document 
industry wide factors that we are focused on include  among others  near term competition for thalomid  delays in the introduction of revlimid and  in the longer term  failure to commercialize our early stage drug candidates 
near term competition for thalomid in june  the fda approved millenium pharmaceuticals  inc s 
velcade r for use in refractory multiple myeloma patients 
while it s possible that velcade could reduce thalomid sales in multiple myeloma  we believe that thalomid will continue to be used as a first line treatment and that velcade will likely be used in patients that have not had success with thalomid 
also  generic competition could reduce thalomid sales 
however  we believe this is unlikely  at least in the near term  given the fact that we have four patents that expire between the years and covering the system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps  distribution system  which all patients receiving thalidomide must follow and several issued patents covering thalomid use in oncology 
even if generic competition could manage to enter the market  it is unlikely they could do so before given the time needed to commercialize a product  and by that time  we expect to have at least partially replaced thalomid with revlimid 
delay in the introduction of revlimid while we have made excellent progress in our efforts to accelerate the path to regulatory approval of revlimid now being tested in ongoing pivotal phase iii special protocol assessment trials and phase ii trials  all of which remain on or ahead of their planned patient accrual timelines for potential approvals in  a delay in the introduction of revlimid or its failure to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to commercialize early stage drug candidates our long term success and sustainability is dependent on our ability to move our earlier stage drug candidates through development and to realize the commercial potential of our broad pipeline 
company background celgene was organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a chemical company 
in  we were spun off as an independent chemical biotechnology company and in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
at first  our operations involved the research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
in  we discontinued the biotreatment operations to focus on our targeted small molecule cancer and immunology compound development programs and our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program 
between and  our revenues were generated primarily through the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and  in january  we sold chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation 
revenue from thalomid sales  license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs began to increase at this time 
in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid thalidomide for use in enl  a side effect of leprosy  and  in september  we commenced sales of thalomid in the united states 
sales of thalomid  our lead product  have grown significantly each year since the launch and  in  and we recorded net thalomid sales of million  million and million  respectively 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering in which we raised proceeds  net of offering expenses  of approximately million 
in april  we signed a license and development agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis a license for d mph  our chirally pure version of ritalin 
the agreement provides for significant upfront and milestone payments based on achieving various regulatory approvals and royalties on the entire family of ritalin products upon approval of d mph by the fda 
we have retained the rights for the use of d mph in oncology indications 
we received approval from the fda to market d mph  or focalin tm  on november  in august  we acquired signal pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease and  in december  we acquired anthrogenesis corp  a privately held biotherapeutics company pioneering the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a full term  successful pregnancy 
in march  we entered into a three year supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk to distribute  promote and sell alkeran melphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and for palliation of carcinoma of the ovary 
under the terms of the agreement  we purchase alkeran tablets and alkeran for injection from glaxosmithkline and distributes the products in the united states under the celgene label 
the agreement  which provides us with an approved oncology product  requires that we purchase certain minimum quantities each year for an initial three year term under a take or pay arrangement aggregating million over such period 
at december   the remaining minimum purchase requirements under the agreement were million 
in june  we raised an additional  net of expenses  through the issuance of unsecured convertible notes to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes have a face value of million  a term of five years  a coupon rate of payable semi annually and are convertible at any time into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  which represents a premium to our closing stock price on may  until  we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in for the year ended december   we posted net income of million 
we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  and have since our inception financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales  public and private sales of our equity securities and debt  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities and revenues from research contracts and license payments 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products 
we expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of increased clinical trial costs and expenses associated with regulatory approval and commercialization of products now in development 
however  these expenditures are expected to be more than offset by increasing product sales  royalties  revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and investment income 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue total revenue and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows change to to in thousands net product sales thalomid    focalin    alkeran  n a n a stem cell therapies n a n a total net product sales    collaborative agreements and other revenue    royalty revenue   n a related party collaborative agreement revenue  n a n a total revenue    thalomid net sales increases in and were due to the combination of price increases and increasing use by oncologists in the treatment of various types of cancers  especially first line use in multiple myeloma 
thalomid net sales in also benefited from the market introduction of two new higher strength formulations during the first half of  which had higher per unit sales prices 
net sales of focalin  which received fda approval in november  were lower in due to the timing of shipments to novartis for their commercial distribution 
the alkeran supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline was executed in march and sales of alkeran began during the second quarter of consequently  sales for this product are reflected only in the period 
collaborative agreements and other revenue for the year ended december  included primarily million related to the agreement to terminate the gelclair co promotion agreement between osi pharmaceuticals inc and celgene  million of research and license funding received in connection with the pharmion collaboration agreements  million of reimbursements from novartis for shipments of bulk raw material used in the formulation of focalin la and utilized in clinical studies conducted by novartis and million of revenue from the stem cell therapies segment  which became effective with the acquisition of anthrogenesis on december  the period included primarily million of amortization of an up front payment and a million milestone payment received from novartis pharma ag in connection with the serm license agreement  million of license revenue from pharmion and million of certain other milestone payments 
the period included primarily million of amortization of upfront payments related to two separate agreements with novartis and a milestone payment of million from novartis for receiving fda approval to market focalin 
royalty revenue reflects royalties received from novartis on sales of their entire family of ritalin drugs 
there was no related party revenue in and as the agreement with axys pharmaceuticals  which we treated as a related party in and under which we recorded revenue of million in expired in october cost of goods sold cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands cost of goods sold    increase from prior year   n a percentage increase from prior year n a percentage of net product sales cost of goods sold increased in compared to  primarily due to a significant increase in thalomid sales volumes  higher royalties on thalomid product sales and the introduction of alkeran 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales in compared to was primarily due to the introduction of alkeran  which has a significantly higher cost structure than thalomid  partially offset by higher gross profits on thalomid due to price increases initiated during the year and by higher sales of focalin  which also has a higher cost structure than thalomid 
similar to  cost of goods sold increased in compared to  due to a significant increase in thalomid sales volumes 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales of focalin  which as indicated above  has a higher cost structure than thalomid and higher thalomid product royalties resulting from higher sales and thereby triggering higher royalty percentages 
focalin product costs incurred prior to its approval in november were expensed as research and development expenses 
focalin actual costs will continue to be lower than its standard costs until the product associated with the previously expensed costs are completely sold 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees  principally with contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs  clinical drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs as well as other consumable research supplies  and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities 
research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands research and development expenses    increase from prior year   n a percentage increase from prior year n a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased in compared to  primarily due to the initiation of several large studies related to our thalomid and revlimid clinical programs in the second half of in  approximately million was spent on thalomid and its follow on compounds ie  the imids and selcids and focalin  primarily for preclinical toxicology  phase i ii and phase iii clinical trials and regulatory expenses  approximately million was spent in gene regulation  target and drug discovery and agro chemical programs  and approximately million was spent on stem cell therapy programs  primarily for internal headcount related expenses  laboratory supplies and product development costs 
in  approximately million was spent on thalomid and the imids and selcids compounds  primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase i ii clinical trials  the initiation of our phase iii clinical trials in multiple myeloma and metastatic melanoma and legal expenses related to patent filings and approximately million was spent in gene regulation  target discovery and agro chemical programs  primarily for internal headcount related expenses  laboratory supplies and product development costs 
in  approximately million was spent on thalomid and the imids and selcids compounds  primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase i ii clinical trials  regulatory expenses for preparation of a supplementary new drug application snda for thalomid in multiple myeloma and legal expenses related to patent filings  approximately million was spent for focalin  primarily for drug supply that was expensed prior to fda approval and approximately million was spent in gene regulation  target discovery and agro chemical programs  primarily for internal headcount related expenses  laboratory supplies and product development costs 
as total revenue increases  research and development expense may continue to decrease as a percent of total revenue  however the actual dollar amount will continue to increase as earlier stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages 
for information about the commercial status  target diseases and the development of our drug compounds  refer to the product overview table contained in part i  item i of this document 
in general  the estimated times to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows clinical phase estimated completion time phase i years phase ii years phase iii years due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred in bringing a project to completion 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses consist of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel  warehousing and distribution costs  and other commercial expenses to support the sales force and the education and registration efforts underlying the steps program 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  outside services for legal  audit  tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs  principally for rent  utilities and property taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses    increase from prior year   n a percentage increase from prior year n a percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  primarily due to million of expenses incurred within the stem cell therapies segment  which became effective with the acquisition of anthrogenesis in december  an increase of approximately million in commercial expenses related to the expansion of the sales and marketing organization and an increase in customer service staff and an increase of approximately million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in commercial expenses to support the commercialization of thalomid  with an increase of approximately million in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to our sales force expansion 
as a percent of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately in from approximately in both the and periods 
litigation settlement and related agreements in december  we entered into a series of agreements with entremed  inc and children s medical center corporation cmcc to effectively terminate ongoing litigation relating to patents for thalidomide analogs and to grant an exclusive license to celgene for the rights to those patents 
under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with entremed  we paid to entremed million for all thalidomide analog patents and associated clinical data and records  and the termination of any litigation surrounding those patents 
under the terms of a securities purchase agreement with entremed  we acquired from entremed  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  and warrants for an additional  common shares for approximately million 
we completed an assessment of the estimated realizable value of the investment 
considering the level of the company s ownership interest in entremed  its history of operating losses and the fact that entremed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in research and development activities with proposed products and research programs in the early stage of clinical development  and based on such assessment  the entire amount of such preferred stock was written down 
we also signed an exclusive license agreement with cmcc that terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between cmcc and entremed and directly granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents 
we paid to cmcc million under this agreement with another million payable between and  the present value of which totaled million and was expensed in additionally  we entered into a five year sponsored research agreement with cmcc whereby we have committed million per year in funding 
additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs 
we recorded a charge to earnings for the cost of these agreements and related expenses of million in including the write down of the entremed series a convertible preferred stock and certain legal expenses incurred in connection with the settlement 
for more information on the litigation settlement and related agreements  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development on december   we completed the acquisition of anthrogenesis corp  which now operates as celgene cellular therapeutics  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  under which approximately million was allocated to ipr d and charged to expense at the acquisition date 
for more information on the anthrogenesis acquisition  refer to notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately to million in  from in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in  partially offset by an increase of million in realized gains on marketable securities 
interest and other income increased approximately to million in  from million in the increase was primarily related to higher realized gains of approximately million on sales of certain marketable securities partially offset by lower interest income on lower average cash balances and lower yields on our securities during interest expense interest expense was approximately million in and reflects interest on the million unsecured convertible notes issued on june  interest expense for the and periods was immaterial 
income tax benefit provision in we recognized tax expense of million for federal and state purposes and in  we recognized million for state tax purposes 
during  and  we also recognized a tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
income loss from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations and per common share amounts for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands  except per share amounts income loss from continuing operations    per common share amounts basic diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock utilized to calculate per common share amounts basic    diluted    in  we recorded income from continuing operations for the first time since our inception in income loss from continuing operations increased in due to an increase in total revenues of approximately million  lead by an increase in thalomid net sales of million and first time alkeran sales of million and one time costs incurred in of million from the write off of acquired in process research and development related to the anthrogenesis acquisition and million associated with litigation settlement and related agreements with entremed  inc and cmcc 
offsetting these increases were higher operating costs and expenses of approximately million  a decrease in other income and expense of approximately million and  from a per share perspective  the higher number of shares of common stock utilized to calculate the per common share amounts in the loss from continuing operations increased significantly in compared to primarily due to the aggregate one time costs of million described above  an increase of million in other operating costs and expenses and a decrease of million in the income tax benefit  partially offset by an increase in total revenue of million and an increase in net interest and other income and expense of million 
gain on sale of chiral assets in january  we completed the sale of our chiral intermediate business to cambrex corporation 
pursuant to the minimum royalty provisions of the agreement  we received approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  working capital requirements have been financed primarily through product sales  private and public sales of debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of such securities and revenue from research contracts and license and milestone payments 
since our initial product launch in the third quarter of  we have recorded net product sales totaling approximately million through december  on june   we issued convertible notes to institutional investors in the amount of million 
proceeds from the transaction  net of debt issuance costs  were approximately million 
net working capital  ie  current assets minus current liabilities at december  increased approximately to million from million at december  the increase was primarily due to higher total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  as well as increases in both inventory  with the addition of alkeran  and trade receivables  due to the increase in thalomid sales  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  and investments in marketable securities available for sale increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to the net proceeds of million received in connection with the million convertible note offering on june we expect the rate of spending to increase as a result of research and product development spending  increased clinical trial costs  increased expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products currently in development  increased costs related to the commercialization of thalomid and increased capital investments 
existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  combined with increasing thalomid product sales  the introduction of alkeran and various research agreements and collaborations are expected to provide sufficient capital for our operations for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas 
for the early stage compounds  the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives fda marketing approval 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
continuation of certain contracts is dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones  however  none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project 
research funding is recorded in the period during which the expenses covered by the funding occurred 
sab no 
updates the guidance in sab no 
and requires companies to identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in quarters beginning after june  if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting under the separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
the adoption of eitf did not impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations  but could affect the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for future collaborative research and or license agreements 
prior to the adoption of eitf  revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  were recognized when and if the milestones were achieved 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks we record an allowance for sales returns based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
we record medicaid rebate accruals based on historical payment data and estimates of medicaid beneficiary utilization 
we record chargeback accruals based on actual sales to customers who are covered under federally qualified programs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we recognized a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets based on a cumulative three year history of losses including operating losses in each of the last three years 
accounting for long term incentive plans we recorded a liability for the plan based on achieving an estimated award of of the target 
the plan provides payout in the range of to 
acquired in process research and development ipr d the value assigned to acquired in process research and development is determined by identifying those acquired specific in process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a technological feasibility has not been established at the acquisition date  b there is no alternative future use  and c the fair value is estimable with reasonable reliability 
amounts assigned to ipr d are charged to expense at the acquisition date 
the estimated fair value of these projects is determined by employment of a discounted cash flow model 
the discount rates used takes into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process technology projects that are valued 
the analysis includes forecasted future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on the in process project prior to the purchase dates 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from the total forecasted net revenues to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  these net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and the company as well as product specific risks associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  likelihood of success  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan and takes into consideration an overall discount rate  which represents a risk premium to the company s weighted average cost of capital for purchase valuation purposes 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used by management in analyzing ipr d is based on assumptions  which management believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
the valuations used to estimate ipr d require us to use significant estimates and assumptions  that if changed  may result in a different valuation for ipr d 
valuations for the anthrogenesis acquisition were completed by an independent third party consulting firm in accordance with sec guidelines

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
the company has established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for its investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the company s investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
the company does not use derivative instruments for investment or trading purposes
