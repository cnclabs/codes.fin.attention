item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current assessment of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements and  therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on them 
important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements are discussed in this report  including the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  and business risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item general overview arch capital group ltd 
acgl  a bermuda public limited liability company with over billion in capital  provides insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis through its wholly owned subsidiaries 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we are focusing on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance 
it is our belief that our existing bermuda and us based underwriting platform  our strong management team and our capital that is unencumbered by significant exposure to pre risks have enabled us to establish a strong presence in an attractive insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
the worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive and has traditionally been subject to an underwriting cycle in which a hard market high premium rates  restrictive underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting gains is eventually followed by a soft market low premium rates  relaxed underwriting standards  as well as terms and conditions  and underwriting losses 
insurance market conditions may affect  among other things  the demand for our products  our ability to increase premium rates  the terms and conditions of the insurance policies we write  changes in the products offered by us or changes in our business strategy 
the financial results of the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by factors such as the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including natural disasters or other catastrophic events  variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in the legal  regulatory and judicial environments  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions 
these factors influence the demand for insurance or reinsurance  the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market 
during  market conditions had been improving primarily as a result of declining insurance capacity 
in general  market conditions continued to improve during and in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
this reflects improvement in pricing  terms and conditions following significant industry losses arising from the events of september th  as well as the recognition that intense competition in the late s led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
such industry developments resulted in poor financial results and erosion of the industry s capital base 
consequently  many established insurers and reinsurers reduced their participation in  or exited from  certain markets 
these developments have provided relatively new insurers and reinsurers  like us  with an opportunity to provide needed underwriting capacity and to write insurance and reinsurance business at what we believe to be attractive rates 
as a provider of insurance and reinsurance  we are exposed to certain interrelated risks that are unique to the business of insurance  including rate adequacy  reserve estimation and underwriting risk 
management focuses on such risks in its evaluation of acgl s financial condition and operating results 
certain parts of our business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity 
such characteristics may result in volatility in our operating results from period to period 
in addition  estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those for a company with a longer operating history since very limited historical information has been reported to us through december  the adequacy of premium rates is dependent on the ultimate loss experience related to the policies or contracts underwritten 
as the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement typically extends many years into the future  the pricing of insurance products is necessarily based on estimates 
management periodically reviews available information from industry and other sources in order to evaluate the adequacy of current premium rates 
there are several sources of reserve estimation risk 
unforeseen changes in the economic  social and legal environments can increase the costs to settle claims above anticipated levels 
although actuarial techniques attempt to estimate the impact of such changes  they may not fully reflect our ultimate loss experience 
although we can never eliminate estimation risk  we attempt to reduce it by trying to incorporate as much information as possible into our estimates 
underwriting risk refers to the uncertainty about the exposures underwritten by us  including the possibility that a single event or set of events will simultaneously affect multiple exposures and the possibility that the wording in policies or contracts underwritten by us will be reinterpreted in the future to our detriment 
uncertainty about exposures underwritten by us can arise because policyholders and ceding companies may have failed to disclose all relevant information to us when the policies and contracts were issued  or because of an unusual event  such as a natural or man made catastrophe that simultaneously affects multiple exposures 
our overall strategy is to be highly selective in the risks we underwrite  and to be opportunistic in our management of the underwriting cycle  with the ultimate objective of generating superior risk adjusted returns to our shareholders 
in addition  our strategy is to focus on keeping our expenses low relative to our premiums  as well as to our competitors  and to allocate our capital effectively 
financial measures that are meaningful in analyzing our performance are underwriting profitability as measured by the combined ratio and return on equity 
the combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability  excluding investment income  and is the sum of the loss ratio and underwriting expense ratios 
a combined ratio under represents an underwriting profit and a combined ratio over represents an underwriting loss 
our combined ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  return on equity provides an indication of the return generated on capital deployed in the business and is calculated based on the level of net income generated in relation to shareholders equity 
our net income for the year ended december  represented an return on average equity  compared to a return on average equity for the year ended december  history we commenced operations in september following the completion of the initial public offering of our predecessor  arch capital group us inc us 
us is a delaware company formed in march under the original name of risk capital holdings  inc from that time until may  we provided reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance companies 
on may   we sold our prior reinsurance book of business to folksamerica reinsurance company in an asset sale  but retained our surplus and our us licensed reinsurance platform 
on november   following shareholder approval  we changed our legal domicile to bermuda in order to benefit from bermuda s favorable business  regulatory  tax and financing environment 
during the period from may through the announcement of our underwriting initiative in october  we built and acquired insurance businesses that enable us to generate both fee based revenue eg  commissions and advisory and management fees and risk based revenue ie  insurance premium 
as part of this strategy  we built an underwriting platform that is intended to enable us to maximize risk based revenue during periods in the underwriting cycle when we believe it is more favorable to assume underwriting risk 
in october  we concluded that underwriting conditions favored dedicating our attention exclusively to building our insurance and reinsurance business 
in october  we launched an underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets that included the recruitment of new insurance and reinsurance management teams and an equity capital infusion of million 
in april  we completed an offering of common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in september  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of class a warrants by our principal shareholders and certain other investors 
due to the significant changes in our business during the years and  we believe that comparisons of the results of operations with are not meaningful 
therefore  results of operations discussed below relate to the years ended december  and revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the issuance of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are driven by the volume and classes of business of the policies and contracts that we write and prevailing market prices 
the premium we charge for the risks assumed is priced based on many assumptions 
we price these risks well before our ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 
in addition  our revenues include fee income and income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income investments that are held as available for sale 
under our basis of accounting  generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  these investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of operations 
rather  these unrealized gains and losses are included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses primarily consist of losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs  other operating expenses and non cash compensation 
losses and loss adjustment expenses include management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
such costs consist of three components paid losses  changes in estimated amounts for known losses case reserves  and changes in reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for further discussion 
acquisition expenses consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
a significant portion of such costs is paid based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary for each class or type of business that we underwrite 
other operating expenses  a significant portion of which are general and administrative expenses  consist primarily of compensation related expenses 
non cash compensation relates to certain grants primarily of restricted common shares under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements 
the issuance of restricted common shares and the related recognition of non cash compensation expense have no impact on our shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since very limited historical information has been reported to us through december  actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and gaap to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the business we underwrite 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured claims which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
due to the lack of historical loss data for our reinsurance and insurance operations  and the inability to use a historical loss development methodology  there is a possibility that significant changes in the reserve estimates in future periods could occur 
insurance and reinsurance loss reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
during this period  additional facts and trends will become known and  as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted in the period in which the new information becomes known 
while reserves are established based upon available information  certain factors  such as those inherent in the political  judicial and legal systems  including judicial and litigation trends and legislation changes  could impact the ultimate liability 
changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by reducing our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred  and it is likely that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance and reinsurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves 
even actuarially sound methods can lead to subsequent adjustments to loss reserves that are both significant and irregular due to the nature of the risks written  potentially by a material amount 
for our reinsurance operations  we establish case reserves based on reports of claims notices received from ceding companies 
case reserves usually are based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company 
reported case reserves on known events may be supplemented by additional case reserves 
additional case reserves are often estimated by our claims function ahead of official notification from the ceding company  or when our judgment regarding the size or severity of the known event differs from the ceding company 
in certain instances  we may establish additional case reserves even when the ceding company does not report any liability on a known event 
for our insurance operations  generally  claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices and the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
our insurance operations also contract with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who  in certain cases  have limited authority to establish case reserves 
the work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel 
reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
periodically  adjustments to the reported or case reserves may be made as additional information regarding the claims is reported or payments are made 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain ibnr reserves 
such reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported to an insurer or reinsurer as well as to actuarially adjust for any projected variance in case reserving 
even though most insurance policies have policy limits  the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could very significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies 
we attempt to limit our risk of loss through reinsurance and may also use retrocessional arrangements 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we have made various assumptions relating to the pricing of our reinsurance contracts and insurance policies and have also considered available historical industry experience and current industry conditions 
our reserving method for and was primarily the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists 
we select the initial expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios based on information derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business  supplemented by industry data where appropriate 
these ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
any estimates and assumptions made as part of the reserving process could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors  including the fact that very limited historical information has been reported to us through december  reinsurance operations by their nature add further complexity to the reserving process in that there is an inherent additional lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event to a reinsurer from an insured or ceding company through a broker 
as actual loss information is reported to us and we develop our own loss experience  our reserving methods will also include other actuarial techniques 
it is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a future period or our financial condition in general 
we are only permitted to establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for losses that have occurred on or before the applicable financial statement date 
case reserves and ibnr reserves contemplate these obligations 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses do not reflect contingency reserve allowances to account for future loss occurrences 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial 
at december   our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by type and by operating segment were as follows in thousands reinsurance insurance total case reserves    ibnr reserves    total net reserves    as described above  we primarily use the expected loss method to calculate our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists  and represents management s best estimate of our reserves 
as the loss history develops  we will utilize other actuarial methods to evaluate our reserves 
due to the lack of historical loss data for our reinsurance and insurance operations  generally we do not produce a range of estimates in calculating reserves 
in order to illustrate the potential volatility in our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we used a statistical model to simulate a range of results based on various probabilities 
both the probabilities and related modeling are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the simulation relies on a significant number of assumptions  such as the potential for multiple entities to react similarly to external events  and includes other statistical assumptions 
our recorded estimate of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  by operating segment at december   along with the results of the simulation are as follows in thousands reinsurance insurance total total net reserves    simulation results th percentile    th percentile    simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will not exceed the indicated amount 
simulation results indicate that a percent probability exists that the net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses will be at or below the indicated amount 
the simulation results shown for each segment do not add to the total simulation results  as the individual segment simulation results do not reflect the diversification effects across our segments 
the simulation results noted above are informational only  and no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be significantly different than the simulation results shown above  and such differences could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined 
we do not have significant exposure to pre liabilities  such as asbestos related illnesses and other long tail liabilities and  to date  we have experienced a relatively low level of reported claims activity in most of our business  particularly in our longer tail exposures  such as casualty  executive assurance and professional liability  which have longer time periods during which claims are reported and paid 
our limited history does not provide any meaningful trend information 
see results of operations segment information for a discussion of prior year development of loss reserves 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the policy inception and are primarily earned on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the policies for all products 
premiums written include estimates in our program business and aviation business 
the amount of such insurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable at december  was million 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of such premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of in force insurance policies 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums for which ceding company reports have not been received 
the basis for the amount of premiums written recognized varies based on the type of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
the amount of reinsurance premium estimates included in premiums receivable and the amount of related acquisition expenses by type of business was as follows at december  in thousands gross amount acquisition expenses net amount casualty    other specialty    property excluding property catastrophe    marine and aviation    non traditional    property catastrophe    total    reinsurance premium estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  based on management s detailed review by treaty  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums 
in addition  a confirmation by the responsible underwriter to the broker as to the realization of the expected premium is performed prior to the detailed treaty review along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates recorded 
based on such review  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
due to the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance premiums assumed  irrespective of the type of business  are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts 
contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover losses which occur during the term of the contract or policy  which typically extends months 
accordingly  the premium is earned evenly over the term 
pro rata contracts  which are written on a risks attaching basis  cover losses which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such pro rata contracts 
premiums earned on a risks attaching basis usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract  typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a month period 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses  are recorded based upon the projected experience under such contracts 
we also write certain business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance 
under these contracts  we assume a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for a margin 
the terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience  loss corridors  sublimits and caps 
examples of such business include aggregate stop loss coverages and financial quota share coverages 
certain assumed reinsurance contracts  which pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  are deemed  for financial reporting purposes  not to transfer insurance risk  are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in statement of position sop  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk 
management exercises significant judgment in the assumptions used in determining whether assumed contracts should be accounted for as reinsurance contracts under sfas no 
or deposit insurance contracts under sop for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in our underwriting results 
when the estimated profit margin is explicit  the margin is reflected as fee income  and when the estimated profit margin is implicit it is reflected as an offset to paid losses 
for those contracts that do not transfer an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit is reflected in earnings over the estimated settlement period using the interest method and such profit is included in investment income 
additional judgments are required when applying the accounting guidance as set forth in sop with respect to the revenue recognition criteria for contracts deemed not to transfer insurance risk 
certain of our reinsurance contracts  which may include multi year contracts  reinsure both past retroactive and future prospective insurable events 
pursuant to sfas no 
 which governs accounting for retroactive reinsurance contracts  when a reinsurance contract contains both a retroactive and prospective element  the retroactive element is bifurcated from the contract and the expected profit is deferred as a liability and recognized in earnings over the settlement period 
acquisition expenses and other expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business in our underwriting operations are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
acquisition expenses consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses 
other operating expenses also include expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business 
acquisition expenses are reflected net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers 
deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience  and anticipated investment income 
policy related fee income  such as billing  cancellation and reinstatement fees  is primarily recognized as earned when substantially all of the related services have been provided 
policy related fee income will vary in the future related to such activity and is earned primarily in our non standard automobile business 
collection of insurance related balances and provision for doubtful accounts we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance ceded because the ceding of risk to reinsurers or retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties  as appropriate 
we are also subject to credit risk from our alternative market products  such as rent a captive risk sharing programs  which allow a client to retain a significant portion of its loss exposure without the administrative costs and capital commitment required to establish and operate its own captive 
in certain of these programs  we participate in the operating results by providing excess reinsurance coverage and earn commissions and management fees 
in addition  we write program business on a risk sharing basis with managing general agents or brokers  which may be structured with commissions which are contingent on the underwriting results of the program 
while we attempt to obtain collateral from such parties in an amount sufficient to guarantee their projected financial obligations to us  there is no guarantee that such collateral will be sufficient to secure their actual ultimate obligations 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of all the reinsurers we cede business to  particularly focusing on those reinsurers that are assigned an a 
m 
best rating lower than a excellent or those that are designated as nr not rated 
if our analysis indicates that there is significant uncertainty regarding the collectibility of amounts due from reinsurers  managing general agents  brokers and other clients  we will record a provision for doubtful accounts 
at december  and  our reserve for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
premiums receivable and paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable balances as of december  include approximately and  respectively  of amounts not yet due and amounts in excess of days overdue were less than of the total balances in each caption 
valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce certain of our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in addition  if we subsequently assessed that the valuation allowance was no longer needed  a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination was made 
at december   we have a valuation allowance of million against a deferred tax asset in one of our subsidiaries that currently does not have a business plan to produce significant future taxable income 
investments we currently classify all of our publicly traded fixed maturity investments  short term investments and equity securities as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity securities is estimated using quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
short term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue 
short term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of our investment portfolios under the management of external investment managers 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies 
our investments in privately held equity securities  other than those carried under the equity method of accounting  are carried at estimated fair value 
fair value is initially considered to be equal to the cost of such investment until the investment is revalued based on substantive events or other factors which could indicate a diminution or appreciation in value 
we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  for privately held equity investments accounted for under the equity method  and we record our percentage share of the investee company s net income or loss 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and emerging issues task force  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we periodically review our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline and iv our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
where our analysis of the above factors results in the conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the securities is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore reflected as a realized loss 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
as mentioned above  we consider our intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
however  this factor  on its own  is not determinative as to whether we will recognize an impairment charge 
we believe our ability to hold such securities is supported by our positive cash flow from operations where we can generate sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claims payment obligations arising from our underwriting operations without selling such investments 
cash flow from operating activities was billion and million  in and  respectively 
however  subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and assessing value relative to other comparable securities 
while our external investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe the preferred course of action is to hold securities until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon a change in market and other factors 
we believe these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale 
stock issued to employees we have adopted the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that we believe were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
accordingly  under apb no 
 compensation expense for stock option grants is recognized only to the extent that the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
for restricted shares granted  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value of the shares at the measurement date  which is amortized and primarily charged to income as non cash compensation over the vesting period 
these restricted shares are recorded as outstanding upon issuance regardless of any vesting period 
see results of operations non cash compensation 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by using various methods  including a review of the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit in the future 
such methods include a number of assumptions  including the uncertainty regarding future results and the discount rates used 
if the reporting unit s fair value is greater than its carrying value  goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired 
impairment occurs when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets are less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
we conduct the impairment test annually 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances indicating that more likely than not the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets has been impaired

diluted average shares outstanding net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was primarily due to a significant increase in the underwriting results of both our reinsurance and insurance operations  as discussed in segment information below

the increase in diluted average shares outstanding from to was primarily due to the issuance of  convertible preference shares and  class a warrants in connection with our capital infusion in november   common shares in connection with an offering completed by us in april  and  convertible preference shares on june  and  convertible preference shares on december  pursuant to the subscription agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion

segment information we determined our reportable operating segments using the management approach described in sfas no

management measures segment performance based on underwriting income or loss  which includes the excess or deficiency of net premiums earned for each reporting period over the combined total of expenses and losses incurred during the same period 
due to the significant changes in our business during the years and  we believe that comparisons of the results of operations of our business segments for such years with are not meaningful 
therefore  the comparison of segment results discussed below relate to the years ended december  and during the year ended december   we had only one reportable operating segment insurance 
during  the insurance operating segment generated revenues of million and net income of million 
the remaining portion of our net income was generated through our investment activities  offset by other operating expenses

the reinsurance segment s underwriting income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in underwriting income in was primarily due to a significantly higher level of net premiums earned 
the combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the components of the reinsurance segment s underwriting income are discussed below 
premiums written 
gross premiums written for our reinsurance segment increased by to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we are currently retaining substantially all of our reinsurance premiums written 
we do  however  participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain treaties 
such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties  including the reinsurer  such as us  and the ceding company 
we will continue to evaluate our retrocessional requirements 
net premiums written for our reinsurance segment increased by to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  over half of the increase in net premiums written was attributable to casualty business 
for the year ended december   and of net premiums written were generated from pro rata contracts and excess of loss treaties  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  pro rata contracts are typically written at a lower loss ratio and higher expense ratio than excess of loss business 
in certain cases  the reinsurance segment writes pro rata contracts where the underlying business consists of excess of loss treaties

for the year ended december   and of net premiums earned were generated from pro rata contracts and excess of loss treaties  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  other underwriting related fee income 
certain assumed reinsurance contracts are deemed  for financial reporting purposes  not to transfer insurance risk  and are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting 
for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period 
when the estimated profit margin is explicit  the margin is reflected as fee income 
we recorded million of fee income on such contracts for the year ended december  losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reinsurance segment losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned  compared to million  or  for the year ended december  the loss ratio for the year ended december  benefited from net favorable development on losses originally recorded during of million  which resulted in a point reduction in the loss ratio 
the favorable development in our reinsurance segment did not reflect any changes in key assumptions we made to estimate these reserves 
this development primarily resulted from the fact that both the frequency and the severity of reported losses have been lower than the assumed pattern of losses established for property and other short tail business at december   which  in turn  led to a decrease in our expected loss ratio during the remainder of the reduction in the loss ratio compared to the year ended december  resulted from changes in the mix of business earned

underwriting expenses 
the acquisition expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december   and the other operating expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  movements in the acquisition expense ratio reflect changes in the percentage of net premiums earned from pro rata contracts along with the mix of business 
while aggregate operating expenses were higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the operating expense ratio decreased primarily due to the growth in net premiums earned in the period

underwriting income loss 
the insurance segment s underwriting income was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in underwriting profitability in was primarily due to a significantly higher level of net premiums earned 
in addition  the insurance segment s combined ratio improved to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the components of the insurance segment s underwriting income or loss are discussed below 
premiums written 
gross premiums written for our insurance segment increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  the insurance segment established new underwriting units in various specialty lines and began writing business in these new areas of focus primarily during the last six months of the year 
the insurance segment also added a number of new accounts in its program business during in addition to new business written in the year ended december   premiums written also include the renewal of certain accounts initially written in accordingly  premiums written by the insurance segment during the year ended december  were significantly higher than the comparable year ended december  net premiums written for our insurance segment increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this increase was a million increase in program business  a million increase in casualty business and a million increase in construction and surety business 
in addition  the insurance segment also significantly reduced the percentage of business ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers in its program business during contributing to the growth in net premiums written 
for information regarding net premiums written produced by major type of business and geographic location  refer to note  segment information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned for our insurance segment increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to substantial growth in net premiums written discussed above  along with increased retentions on our program business 
policy related fee income 
policy related fee income for our insurance segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  such amounts were earned primarily on our non standard automobile business 
other underwriting related fee income 
during the fourth quarter  the insurance segment entered into a reinsurance agreement pursuant to which we assumed certain surety contracts that were in force in october since the reinsurance agreement provides coverage for losses both prior and subsequent to such date  the contract was bifurcated into its prospective and retroactive elements 
we accounted for the retroactive element pursuant to the accounting guidance under sfas no 
 which prescribes that underwriting income generated in connection with retroactive contracts be deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period of the associated claims 
of the total estimated gain of million  million was recognized in the fourth quarter as other underwriting related fee income and the balance of million will be recognized over the settlement period 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
insurance segment losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million  or of net premiums earned  compared to million  or  for the year ended december  the loss ratio for the year ended december  reflects a significantly higher percentage of business from our specialty lines compared with the year ended december   which included a higher percentage of business from our non standard auto business 
to date  in our specialty lines  we have recorded lower loss ratios than in our non standard auto business 
in addition  the loss ratio for the year ended december  included net adverse development on losses originally recorded in prior years of million  which generated a point increase in the loss ratio 
for a discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  please refer to the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
underwriting expenses 
the acquisition expense ratio for our insurance segment is calculated net of certain policy related fee income and is affected by  among other things  the amount of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers and the amount of business written on a surplus lines non admitted basis 
the acquisition expense ratio was for the year ended december  net of points of policy related fee income  compared to for the year ended december  net of points of policy related fee income 
the increase in the acquisition expense ratio primarily resulted from the increased contribution of business from our insurance segment s new areas of focus in the period 
the other operating expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  while aggregate operating expenses were higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in connection with the growth in gross premiums written  the operating expense ratio decreased primarily due to the growth in net premiums earned in the period 
net investment income net investment income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net investment income for the year ended december  was due to the significant increase in our invested assets primarily resulting from cash flow from operations in and  which totaled billion 
the increase in invested assets more than offset the effect of lower yields available in the financial markets in compared to our pre tax and after tax investment yields  respectively  for the year ended december  were and  compared to and for the year ended december  these yields were calculated based on the amortized cost of the portfolio 
yields on future investment income may vary based on financial market conditions  investment allocation decisions and other factors 
net realized investment gains or losses following is a summary of net realized investment gains losses year ended december  in thousands fixed maturities    publicly traded equity securities  privately held securities   other  net realized investment gains losses   income tax expense    net realized investment gains losses  net of tax   currently  our portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines 
the effect of financial market movements on the investment portfolio will directly impact net realized investment gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced 
the net realized investment gains of million for the year ended december  and net realized investment losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  on our fixed income portfolio resulted from the sale of certain securities to reduce credit exposure  and from sales related to rebalancing the portfolio 
included in other in the table above are net realized gains of million for the year ended december  such amount included million of proceeds received from a class action lawsuit related to a publicly traded equity security which we previously owned and for which we had recorded a significant realized loss in a prior year 
our investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
during the years ended december  and  we realized gross losses from the sale of fixed maturities of million and million  respectively 
with respect to those securities that were sold at a loss  the following is an analysis of the gross realized losses based on the period of time those securities had been in an unrealized loss position year ended december  in thousands less than months   at least months but less than months over months total   the fair values of such securities sold at a loss during the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline and iv our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
where our analysis of the above factors results in the conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the securities is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore reflected as a realized loss 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
as mentioned above  we consider our intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
however  this factor  on its own  is not determinative as to whether we will recognize an impairment charge 
we believe our ability to hold such securities is supported by our positive cash flow from operations where we can generate sufficient liquidity in order to meet our claims payment obligations arising from our underwriting operations without selling such investments 
cash flow from operating activities was billion and million  in and  respectively 
however  subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and an assessment of value relative to other comparable securities 
while our external investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe the preferred course of action is to hold securities until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon changes in interest rates  duration targets  relative value and other factors 
we believe these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale 
we did not record an impairment on securities that were purchased and subsequently sold at a loss during the year ended december  due to the factors discussed above 
other other fee income  net of related expenses  represents revenues and expenses provided by our non underwriting operations 
other income is generated by our investments in privately held securities 
at december   we held five investments in privately held securities 
three of such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we record a proportionate share of the investee company s net income or loss based on our ownership percentage in such investment  which amounted to million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expenses primarily represent certain holding company costs necessary to support our growing worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
other expenses for the year ended december  include approximately million of costs related to the resolution of an adjustment basket pursuant to the subscription agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion 
see note  transactions with related parties  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
net foreign exchange gains or losses net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  of  consisted of net unrealized losses of  and net realized gains of  net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  of  consisted of net unrealized losses of  and net realized gains of  foreign exchange gains and losses vary with fluctuations in currency rates and result from the remeasurement of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these gains and losses could add significant volatility to our net income in future periods 
non cash compensation restricted stock during  and  we made certain grants primarily of restricted common shares to employees and to robert clements  chairman of our board of directors  under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements 
these grants were made primarily in connection with our underwriting initiative 
after tax non cash compensation expense included in net income for the year ended december  was million 
after tax non cash compensation expense included in net income for the year ended december  was million  of which million related to certain restricted common shares for which the vesting terms had been accelerated during  as discussed below 
during  our board of directors accelerated the vesting terms of certain restricted common shares granted to mr 
clements  which had been issued in connection with the november capital infusion  and mr 
clements agreed to repay the outstanding million loan previously made to him by us 
mr 
clements was granted  restricted common shares which were initially scheduled to vest in five equal annual amounts commencing on october  the vesting period and the amounts have been changed as follows of the shares vested on october   of the shares vested on october  and will vest on october  the million loan made by us to mr 
clements was used by him to pay income and self employment taxes 
under his retention agreement  mr 
clements received additional compensation in cash in an amount sufficient to defray the loan s interest costs 
in order to facilitate the repayment of the loan  we agreed to repurchase an amount of mr 
clements shares equal to the principal balance of the loan  less any cash payment made by mr 
clements  for a price per share based on the market price for the common shares as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of sale 
in addition  we agreed to make gross up payments to mr 
clements in the event of certain tax liabilities in connection with the repurchase 
pursuant to such arrangements  we repurchased  common shares from mr 
clements for an aggregate purchase price of million 
mr 
clements used all of such sale proceeds and million in cash to repay the entire loan balance on november  following such share repurchase  our book value per diluted share decreased by approximately per share 
during the loan period  compensation to mr 
clements under his retention agreement included payments of  from us  of which  was used by him to pay interest on the loan and the balance was used to pay his related income tax liabilities 
stock options as discussed above under the caption critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements stock issued to employees  we have elected to continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
and have provided the required additional pro forma disclosures 
such pro forma information has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
the fair value of employee stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
see note l  significant accounting policies stock awards  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of the required pro forma information  the estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period 
the weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
had we accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method  our net income per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below  however  the expensing of stock options would have had no impact on our shareholders equity 
years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income  as reported    total stock based employee compensation expense under fair value method  net of tax    pro forma net income    earnings per share diluted as reported pro forma the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
as our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  we believe that the existing option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
the effects of applying sfas no 
as shown in the pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported net income for future years 
extraordinary gain on november   we acquired psic  a non standard automobile insurer  for million 
for the year ended december   we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  or per share  from this acquisition 
the extraordinary gain represented the excess of the fair value of acquired net assets of million over the purchase price of million 
the indicated million fair value of acquired net assets reflected the reduction of the carrying value of certain applicable assets to zero 
in addition  we recorded an extraordinary gain of  in the year ended december  representing an adjustment to the fair value of psic due to the recognition of deferred tax assets as part of the acquisition 
psic is included in our insurance segment 
income taxes acgl changed its legal domicile from the united states to bermuda in november under current bermuda law  we are not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
we have received a written undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of that in the event legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing tax computed on profits  income  gain or appreciation on any capital asset  or tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax will not be applicable to us or our operations until march  acgl will be subject to us federal income tax only to the extent that it derives us source income that is subject to us withholding tax or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the us and is not exempt from us tax under an applicable income tax treaty 
acgl will be subject to a withholding tax on dividends from us investments and interest from certain us taxpayers 
acgl does not consider itself to be engaged in a trade or business within the us and  consequently  does not expect to be subject to direct us income taxation 
however  because there is uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  there can be no assurances that the us internal revenue service will not contend successfully that acgl or its non us subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if acgl or any of its non us subsidiaries were subject to us income tax  acgl s shareholders equity and earnings could be materially adversely affected

our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year consistent with the relative mix of income reported by jurisdiction due primarily to the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction 
we currently estimate that our comparable income tax provision in will result in an effective tax rate of approximately  although no assurances can be given to that effect 
see note  income taxes  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average statutory tax rate for the years ended december   and at december   we have a valuation allowance of million against a deferred tax asset in one of our subsidiaries that currently does not have a business plan to produce significant future taxable income

liquidity and capital resources acgl is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries 
generally  we depend on our available cash resources  liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to make payments  including the payment of operating expenses we may incur and for any dividends our board of directors may determine 
acgl does not currently intend to declare any dividends 
pursuant to a shareholders agreement that we entered into in connection with the november capital infusion  we have agreed not to declare any dividend or make any other distribution on our common shares  and not to repurchase any common shares  until we have repurchased from funds affiliated with warburg pincus llc warburg pincus funds  funds affiliated with hellman friedman llc hellman friedman funds and the other holders of our preference shares  pro rata  on the basis of the amount of each of these shareholders investment in us at the time of such repurchase  preference shares having an aggregate value of million  at a per share price acceptable to these shareholders 
on a consolidated basis  our aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  totaled billion at december  acgl s readily available cash  short term investments and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  totaled million at december  the ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards 
under bermuda law  arch reinsurance ltd 
arch re bermuda is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin ie  the amount by which the value of its general business assets must exceed its general business liabilities equal to the greatest of  of net premiums written being gross premiums written by us less any premiums ceded by us  but we may not deduct more than of gross premiums when computing net premiums written and of loss and other insurance reserves 
arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in compliance with its minimum solvency margin 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files  at least seven days before payment of such dividends  with the bermuda monetary authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited  without prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority  from reducing by or more its total statutory capital  as set out in its previous year s financial statements 
at december   arch re bermuda had statutory capital and surplus as determined under bermuda law of billion including ownership interests in its subsidiaries 
accordingly  of arch re bermuda s capital  or approximately million  is available for dividends during without prior approval under bermuda law  as discussed above 
our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis  may not pay any significant dividends or distributions during without prior regulatory approval 
in addition  the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies 
our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
we are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations 
the assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities to third parties 
we also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for letters of credit to third parties 
at december  and  such amounts approximated million and million  respectively 
in addition  arch re bermuda maintains assets in trust accounts to support insurance and reinsurance transactions with affiliated us companies 
at december  and  such amounts approximated billion and million  respectively 
acgl  through its subsidiaries  provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  through certain reinsurance arrangements essential to the ratings of such subsidiaries 
except as described in the preceding sentence  or where express reinsurance  guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place  each of acgl s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments and no other acgl subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible 
any reinsurance arrangements  guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the acgl subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties creditors or insureds of such entity are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements 
cash flow from operating activities on a consolidated basis are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income and collected reinsurance recoverables  offset by losses and loss adjustment expense payments  reinsurance premiums paid  operating costs and current taxes paid 
consolidated cash provided by operating activities was billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flow in the periods compared to the periods was primarily due to the growth in premium volume and a low level of claim payments due  in part  to the limited history of our insurance and reinsurance operations 
we monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our key operating subsidiaries to compete  sufficient capital to enable its underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the us and other key markets  letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required by our non us operating companies that are non admitted under us state insurance regulations  and revolving credit to meet short term liquidity needs 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our operating subsidiaries  which could place those operating subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our operating subsidiaries are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could increase the cost of bank credit and letters of credit 
in addition to common share capital  we depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares and bank credit 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
we are currently reviewing our capital needs for based on current available information  it is possible that we may raise additional debt and or equity capital during the first half of in order to support our underwriting activities 
as part of our future capital raising activities  we may also seek to supplement  or replace  our current revolving credit facility borrowings described below with longer term debt securities or other debt financing 
we expect that our operational needs  including our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs  for the next twelve months  at a minimum  will be met by our balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments  or as described in the preceding paragraphs 
we have access to letter of credit facilities for up to million as of december  when issued under the letter of credit facilities  such letters of credit are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit facilities which were secured by investments totaling million 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the agreements for such letters of credit facilities at december  the letter of credit facilities expire in august and november it is anticipated that the letter of credit facilities will be renewed or replaced on expiry  but such renewal or replacement will be subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
in the event such support is insufficient  we could be required to provide alternative security to cedents 
this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources 
if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required under such regulations  our operations could be significantly and negatively affected 
in addition to letters of credit  we have and may establish insurance trust accounts in the us and canada to secure our reinsurance amounts payable as required 
at december   cad million had been set aside in canadian trust accounts 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit facilities for a description of the credit facility 
in september  we entered into an unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks which provides for the borrowing of up to million 
the credit facility is in the form of a day revolving credit agreement that may be converted by us into a two year term loan at expiration 
on september   we borrowed million under the credit facility 
the proceeds from such borrowings were contributed to our subsidiaries to support their underwriting activities 
the facility is available to provide capital in support of our growing insurance and reinsurance businesses  as well as other general corporate purposes 
we are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit facility agreement 
these covenants require  among other things  that we i maintain a debt to shareholders equity ratio of not greater than to  ii maintain shareholders equity in excess of billion plus of future aggregate net income not including any future net losses and of future aggregate capital raising proceeds  and iii that our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain at least a b rating from am best 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility agreement at december  see contractual obligations and commercial commitments credit line for a description of the credit facility 
in january  the securities and exchange commission declared effective our universal shelf registration statement 
this registration statement  which replaces our previous shelf registration statement with an unused portion of approximately million  allows for the possible future offer and sale by us of up to million of various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares  common shares  warrants  share purchase contracts and units and depositary shares 
the shelf registration statement enables us to cost effectively and efficiently access public debt and or equity capital markets in order to meet our future capital needs 
any additional issuance of common shares by us could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and our book value per share 
in addition  the registration statement allows selling shareholders to resell up to an aggregate of  common shares that they own or may acquire upon the conversion of outstanding preference shares or warrants in one or more offerings from time to time pursuant to existing registration rights principally granted in connection with the capital infusion 
we will not receive any proceeds from the shares offered by the selling shareholders 
this report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
at december   our total capital of billion consisted of revolving credit facility borrowings of million  representing of the total  and shareholders equity of billion  representing of the total 
at december   our total capital of billion consisted of shareholders equity with no borrowings outstanding 
the increase in our total capital during was primarily attributable to the effects of net income for the year ended december  and the borrowings under our credit facility in september certain matters which may materially affect our results of operations and or financial condition reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections  at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred 
estimating loss reserves is inherently difficult  which is exacerbated by the fact that we are a relatively new company with relatively limited historical experience upon which to base such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
see the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
premium estimates our premiums written and premiums receivable include estimates for our insurance and reinsurance operations 
insurance premiums written include estimates in our program business and aviation business 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums for which ceding company reports have not been received 
the basis for the amount of premiums written recognized varies based on the types of contracts we write 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
premium estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  based on management s detailed review by treaty  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums 
in addition  a confirmation by the responsible underwriter to the broker as to the realization of the expected premium is performed prior to the detailed treaty review along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates recorded 
based on such review  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings favorably or unfavorably in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
due to the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts has been recorded on the premium estimates at december  reinsurance protection and recoverables for purposes of limiting our risk of loss  we reinsure a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write  and we may also use retrocessional protection 
for the year ended december   ceded premiums written represented approximately of gross premiums written  compared to for the year ended december  the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
currently  the market for these arrangements is experiencing high demand for various products and it is not certain that we will be able to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  we may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
further  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and retrocessionaires because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
at december   approximately of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses of million not including prepaid reinsurance premiums were due from carriers which had an am best rating of a or better

additionally  am best has five classifications within the not rated or nr category 
reasons for an nr rating being assigned by am best include insufficient data  size or operating experience  companies which are in run off with no active business writings or are dormant  companies which disagree with their rating and request that a rating not be published or insurers that request not to be formally evaluated for the purposes of assigning a rating opinion 
in connection with our acquisition of arch specialty in february  the seller  sentry  agreed to assume all liabilities arising out of arch specialty s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
in addition to the guarantee provided by sentry  substantially all of the recoverable from sentry is still subject to the original reinsurance agreements inuring to arch specialty and  to the extent sentry fails to comply with its payment obligations to us  we may obtain reimbursement from the third party reinsurers under such agreements 
includes amounts recoverable from separate cell accounts in our alternative markets unit 
substantially all of such amounts are collateralized with letters of credit or deposit funds 
the am best group rating of a excellent has been applied to all lloyd s of london syndicates 
in connection with our acquisition of western diversified in june  the seller  protective life corporation  and certain of its affiliates including lyndon property insurance company agreed to assume all liabilities arising out of western diversified s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
the balance due from lyndon property insurance company reflected above includes all such amounts 
gerling global reinsurance corporation of america is a stand alone subsidiary of gerling globale r ckversicherungs ag 
gerling global reinsurance corporation of america reported that it had approximately million of statutory policyholders surplus at december  and is current in its payment obligations to us 
the following table provides a breakdown of the all other category by am best rating of total companies rated a or better companies not rated total natural and man made catastrophic events we have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires 
catastrophes can also cause losses in non property business such as workers compensation or general liability 
in addition to the nature of property business  we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property  including inflation  property value appreciation and geographic concentration tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
it is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and  to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  claims for natural and man made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  we may not be successful in doing so 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of policy language or otherwise issue a ruling adverse to us 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client and prudent underwriting of each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we generally seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
there can be no assurance that various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  will be enforceable in the manner we intend 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
for our catastrophe exposed business  we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses in any geographic zone 
we monitor our exposure to catastrophic events  including earthquake  wind and specific terrorism exposures  and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures 
our estimated probable maximum pre tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques  but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures 
we seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a percentage of our total shareholders equity for severe catastrophic events 
currently  we generally seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to approximately of total shareholders equity for a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone that could be expected to occur once in every years 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of our total shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques 
in addition  depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio  we may seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a higher percentage of our total shareholders equity for our catastrophe exposed business 
for property catastrophe related exposures from january  through september   our insurance operations entered into a reinsurance treaty which provides coverage for property catastrophe related losses equal to of the first million in excess of a million retention of such losses 
on october   our insurance operations increased their coverage for property catastrophe related losses to of the first million in excess of a million retention of such losses 
in addition  our reinsurance operations have purchased reinsurance which primarily provides coverage for certain catastrophe related losses in california and florida 
recoveries under such reinsurance treaties are calculated based upon the size of insured industry losses 
in the future  we may seek to purchase additional catastrophe or other reinsurance protection 
the availability and cost of such reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
as a result of market conditions and other factors  we may not be successful in obtaining such protection 
see reinsurance protection and recoverables above 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation we write business on a worldwide basis  and our net income may be affected by fluctuations in the value of currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates can reduce our revenues and increase our liabilities and costs  as measured in the us dollar as our functional currency 
we have not attempted to reduce our exposure to these exchange rate risks by investing in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we may therefore suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  we are considering reducing our exposure to these exchange rate risks in by investing in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
management and operations as a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  our success will depend on our ability to integrate new management and operating personnel and to establish and maintain operating procedures and internal controls including the timely and successful implementation of our information technology initiatives  which include the implementation of improved computerized systems and programs to replace or support manual systems to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements  and no assurances can be given as to the success of these endeavors  especially in light of the rapid growth of our business 
accordingly  we have been  and are continuing to  enhance our procedures and controls  including our control over financial reporting 
shareholders agreement the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds together control a majority of our voting power on a fully diluted basis and have the right to nominate a majority of directors to our board under the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion 
the shareholders agreement also provides that we cannot engage in certain transactions  including mergers and acquisitions and transactions in excess of certain amounts  without the consent of a designee of the warburg pincus funds and a designee of the hellman friedman funds 
these provisions could have an effect on the operation of our business and  to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of our common shares 
by reason of their ownership and the shareholders agreement  the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds are able to strongly influence or effectively control actions to be taken by us 
the interests of these shareholders may differ materially from the interests of the holders of our common shares  and these shareholders could take actions that are not in the interests of the holders of our common shares 
contingencies relating to the sale of prior reinsurance operations see note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
industry and ratings we operate in a highly competitive environment  and since the september  events  new capital has entered the market 
these factors may mitigate the benefits that the financial markets may perceive for the property and casualty insurance industry  and we cannot offer any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our industry or that the intensity of competition in our industry will not erode profitability for insurance and reinsurance companies generally  including us 
in addition  we can offer no assurances that we will participate at all or to the same extent as more established or other companies in any price increases or increased profitability in our industry 
if we do not share in such price increases or increased profitability  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
financial strength and claims paying ratings from third party rating agencies are instrumental in establishing the competitive positions of companies in our industry 
periodically  rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for the ratings assigned to us by them 
our reinsurance subsidiaries  arch re us and arch re bermuda  and our principal insurance subsidiaries  arch insurance company  arch e s and arch specialty  each currently has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best 
the a rating is the fourth highest out of fifteen ratings assigned by am best 
with respect to our non standard automobile insurers  american independent has a financial strength rating of b very good from am best  and psic has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best 
the b rating is the sixth highest out of fifteen ratings assigned by am best 
we are in the process of obtaining a financial strength rating for western diversified  acquired in  which currently has been assigned nr rating procedure inapplicable from am best 
rating agencies have been coming under increasing pressure as a result of high profile corporate bankruptcies and may  as a result  increase their scrutiny of rated companies  revise their rating policies or take other action 
we can offer no assurances that our ratings will remain at their current levels  or that our security will be accepted by brokers and our insureds and reinsureds 
a ratings downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  could adversely affect both our relationships with agents  brokers  wholesalers and other distributors of our existing products and services and new sales of our products and services 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments letter of credit facilities we have access to letter of credit facilities loc facilities for up to million as of december  the principal purpose of the loc facilities is to issue  as required  evergreen standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements to ensure that such counterparties are permitted to take credit for reinsurance obtained from our reinsurance subsidiaries in united states jurisdictions where such subsidiaries are not licensed or otherwise admitted as an insurer  as required under insurance regulations in the united states 
the amount of letters of credit issued is driven by  among other things  the timing and payment of catastrophe losses  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the further expansion of our business and the loss experience of such business 
when issued under the loc facilities  such letters of credit are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the loc facilities also requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  with which we were in compliance at december  at such date  we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit under the loc facility which were secured by investments totaling million 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the agreements for such loc facilities at december  in addition to letters of credit  we have and may establish insurance trust accounts in the us and canada to secure our reinsurance amounts payable as required 
at december   cad million had been set aside in canadian trust accounts 
the loc facilities expire in august and november it is anticipated that the loc facilities will be renewed or replaced on expiry  but such renewal or replacement will be subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
in the event such support is insufficient  we could be required to provide alternative security to cedents 
this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources 
if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required under such regulations  our operations could be significantly and negatively affected 
credit line in september  we entered into an unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank and banc of america the credit facility 
the credit facility is in the form of a day revolving credit agreement that may be converted by us into a two year term loan at expiration 
the credit facility provides for the borrowing of up to million with interest at a rate selected by us equal to either i an adjusted london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin or ii an alternate base rate base rate 
the base rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by jpmorgan chase bank as its prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
the payment terms for amounts converted into a term loan at expiration are as follows due months following expiration  due months following expiration and due months following expiration 
the facility is available to provide capital in support of our growing insurance and reinsurance businesses  as well as other general corporate purposes 
we are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit facility agreement 
these covenants require  among other things  that we i maintain a debt to shareholders equity ratio of not greater than to  ii maintain shareholders equity in excess of billion plus of future aggregate net income not including any future net losses and of future aggregate capital raising proceeds  and iii that our principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries maintain at least a b rating from am best 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility agreement at december  on september   we borrowed million at a fixed interest rate of approximately through march following march  the interest rate will be adjusted at the prevailing interest rate at such date as described above 
the proceeds of such borrowings were contributed to our subsidiaries to support their underwriting activities 
we incurred interest expense in connection with the facility of million during in addition  we paid million in fees in connection with the credit facility during such fees were deferred and are being amortized over the loan period 
the unamortized balance at december  was million

off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
we are currently evaluating interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was recently issued by the financial accounting standards board and will become effective for us during the first quarter 
we currently believe that  under such interpretation  we will be required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations if any of a certain managing general agency in which one of our subsidiaries has an investment 
such agency ceased producing business in and is currently running off its operations 
based on current information  no assets or liabilities of such agency would be required to be reflected on the face of our financial statements 
therefore  we believe that the adoption of fin r will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
investments at december   consolidated cash and invested assets totaled billion  consisting of million of cash and short term investments  billion of publicly traded fixed maturity securities and million of privately held securities 
at december   our fixed income portfolio  which includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments  had an average standard poor s quality rating of aa and an average duration of years 
our fixed income investment portfolio is currently managed by external investment advisors under our direction in accordance with investment guidelines provided by us 
our current guidelines stress preservation of capital  market liquidity and diversification of risk

we currently do not utilize derivative financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options or other financial instruments with similar characteristics such as interest rate caps or floors and fixed rate loan commitments 
our portfolio includes investments  such as mortgage backed securities  which are subject to prepayment risk 
our investments in mortgage backed securities  which amounted to approximately million at december   or of cash and invested assets  are classified as available for sale and are not held for trading purposes 
our privately held equity securities consist of securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies 
at december   our private equity portfolio consisted of five investments totaling million in fair value  with additional investment portfolio commitments in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
we do not currently intend to make any significant investments in privately held securities over and above our current commitments

book value per share the following book value per share calculations are based on shareholders equity of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
book value per share excludes the effects of stock options and class b warrants

restricted common shares are included in the number of common shares outstanding as if such shares were issued on the date of grant 
pursuant to the subscription agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion the subscription agreement  an adjustment basket relating to certain non core operations was calculated during the fourth quarter for purposes of determining whether we would be required to issue additional preference shares to the investors as a purchase price adjustment 
the adjustment basket was equal to the difference between value realized upon sale and the gaap book value at the closing of the capital infusion november as adjusted based on a pre determined growth rate of agreed upon non core businesses  plus the difference between gaap net book value of the insurance balances attributable to our core insurance operations with respect to any policy or contract written or having a specified effective date at the time of the final adjustment and those balances at the closing  minus reductions in book value arising from costs and expenses relating to the transaction provided under the subscription agreement  actual losses arising out of breach of representations under the subscription agreement and certain other costs and expenses 
if the adjustment basket had been calculated as less than zero  we would have been required to issue additional preference shares to the investors based on the decrease in value of the components of the adjustment basket 
in february  the parties agreed that the adjustment basket was greater than zero 
accordingly  no purchase price adjustment was required pursuant to the above calculations and  therefore  no additional preference shares will be issued to the investors 
in addition  on the fourth anniversary of the closing  there will be a calculation of a further adjustment basket based on liabilities owed to folksamerica if any under the asset purchase agreement  dated as of january   between us and folksamerica  and specified tax and erisa matters under the subscription agreement 
market sensitive instruments and risk management we are exposed to potential loss from various market risks  including changes in equity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of december  market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and consists of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and invested assets  excluding investments carried under the equity method of accounting 
interest rate risk we consider the effect of interest rate movements on the market value of our assets under management by third party investment managers and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation 
the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate parallel shift in the us interest rate yield curve would have on our assets under management by third party investment managers at december  interest rate shift in basis points in millions total market value     market value change from base change in unrealized appreciation in addition  our million unsecured credit facility is subject to variable interest rates 
on september   we borrowed million at a fixed interest rate of approximately through march at such date  the interest rate will be adjusted at the prevailing interest rate as defined in the credit facility agreement and we will be subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the interest rate available at such date is higher than the current rate

equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risks on the private equity securities included in our investment portfolio 
all of our privately held securities were issued by insurance and reinsurance companies or companies providing services to the insurance industry 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
investments in privately held securities issued by privately held companies may include both equity securities and securities convertible into  or exercisable for  equity securities some of which may have fixed maturities 
our privately held equity securities  which at december  were carried at a fair value of million  have exposure to price risk 
the estimated potential losses in fair value for our privately held equity portfolio resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices  dealer quotes or fair value is approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value  income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation of the us dollar against other currencies under our outstanding contracts at december  would have resulted in unrealized losses of approximately million and would have decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  for further discussion on foreign exchange activity  please refer to results of operations net foreign exchange gains or losses
