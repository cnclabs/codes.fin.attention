item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
we generate revenues from the sale of semiconductor devices that we have designed and developed 
almost all of our revenues in any given year come from the sale of semiconductors that are developed prior to that year 
for example  more than of our revenues in came from parts developed in and earlier 
after an individual part is completed and announced it may take several years before that device generates any significant revenues 
a portfolio of more than products generates our current revenue 
in addition to incurring costs for the marketing  sales and administration of the sale of existing products  we expend a substantial amount every year for the development of new semiconductors 
we decide on the amount to expend on the development of new semiconductors based on our assessment of the future market opportunities for those components  and the estimated return those parts will generate 
for the past three years  we have expended more on the development of new parts than we generate in operating profit from the sale of our existing parts 
throughout this period  we have reduced our research and development spending to a level that we believe matches current market opportunities 
as demand for our products in the end markets that we serve continues to improve then we expect profitability to increase 
net revenues  change change networking products non networking products total net revenues net revenues for increased million  or  over net revenues in net revenues for decreased by million  or  from net revenues in networking in  we saw an improvement over the business conditions that had depressed demand for our communication products in and we saw improved demand for our microprocessor products in enterprise related applications and products used in asynchronous digital subscriber line adsl infrastructure applications 
our customers began placing new orders for our products as they depleted their inventories of our products that they had held over the past two years 
we generated networking revenues of million in  an increase of over in and  our net revenues were impacted by weakness in us and global economies  depressed spending levels by telecommunications companies and enterprises that incorporate our products into their networking equipment and excess inventory levels at customers 
many of our customers experienced significant declines in demand for their products  and accumulated significant inventories of our products that exceeded the amounts required to meet current production levels during this downturn 
this  in turn  negatively impacted our networking revenues  causing them to decline million  or in compared to over the past three years  we have seen significant growth in net revenues generated in asia  on a customer billing location 
net revenues from asia have grown to of total net revenues in  from in and in we attribute this trend primarily to increased manufacturing outsourcing directed into asia by our oem customers as well as increased levels of activity at asian customers 
non networking non networking revenues are comprised of sales of a single medical application related chip  which declined million  or  in and million  or  in due to decreased unit sales to our principal customer in this segment 
while we had wound down this product at the end of  we did ship a small quantity of this product in we do not expect further significant revenue from this product in gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit for increased by million  or  over gross profit in  which decreased by million  or  from gross profit in networking our networking gross profit for increased by million in this increase in networking gross profit related primarily to higher sales volumes in compared to also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the decrease in write downs for excess inventory from million in to nil in networking gross profit as a percentage of networking revenues increased to in from in the following factors affected the margins in compared to a decrease in the write down of excess inventory from million in to nil in  increasing gross profit by percentage points  higher shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over a greater number of units  increasing gross margin by percentage points  and improved margins from a reductions in product material costs was offset by a shift in mix from higher margin networking products to higher volume lower margin applications and a reduction in the average selling price of our high volume products 
our networking gross profit for decreased by million from the decrease in networking gross profit related primarily to lower sales volume in compared to  partially offset by a lower write down of excess inventory of million in compared with a million write down of excess inventory in while networking gross profit as a percentage of networking revenues remained constant at for and  the following factors affected the margins in compared to the write down of excess inventory in was million lower than a similar write down in  increasing gross profit by percentage points  reduced shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over fewer units resulting in lowering gross margin by percentage points  despite reducing manufacturing costs by million  and a shift in mix from the higher margin networking products to those sold into higher volume lower margin applications  further reduced gross profit by percentage points 
non networking in absolute dollar terms  non networking gross profit for both and decreased as a result of declining sales volume 
our non networking product is a single medical device chip 
we do not expect to ship this product in and have not developed any new products of this type 
other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of deferred stock compensation research and development marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues impairment of property and equipment percentage of net revenues restructuring costs and other special charges percentage of net revenues impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets percentage of net revenues amortization of goodwill percentage of net revenues research and development expenses our research and development  or r d  expenses were million  or  lower in compared to due to the restructuring program implemented in the first quarter of and ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
headcount reductions resulting from the first quarter restructuring program and attrition have decreased our r d personnel and related costs by million 
of the remaining million decrease in other r d expenses since  million related to reduced depreciation expense as more property and equipment became fully depreciated and was not replaced 
the other main reason for the decrease in other r d expenses was that costs incurred for product development tools were million lower in than in as less software and related maintenance was required to support current development activity levels 
contributing to this reduction in tooling costs was the closure of our development sites in ireland  india and maryland as there were fewer licenses required to support the reduced r d headcount 
in  our r d expenses decreased to million  or  from due to the company s restructuring and cost reduction programs implemented in the first and fourth quarters of as a result of these programs  we reduced our r d personnel and related costs by million and other r d expenses by million compared to million of this decrease in other r d expenses was attributable to reduced product development materials and development related services and software tools as we downsized the number of development projects we were pursuing at that time 
further  there was a million decrease in depreciation expense due to the write down of property and software assets during our restructuring program 
marketing  general and administrative expenses our marketing  general and administrative  or mg a  expenses decreased million  or  in compared to reductions in headcount due to our first quarter restructuring program and attrition resulted in a decrease of personnel related costs of million 
other mg a expenses decreased million primarily due to reduced sales commissions of million  reduced spending on marketing and corporate communications of million  and decreased professional fees of million 
the reduction in professional fees included the elimination of a provision for potential litigation costs of million 
other mg a expenses also decreased million due to a reduction in facilities related costs  resulting from our restructuring programs and ongoing cost control measures 
in  our mg a expenses decreased by million  or  compared to of this decrease  million was attributable to lower variable sales commissions as a result of lower revenues 
the remainder was attributable to the restructuring and cost reduction programs implemented in  which reduced our mg a personnel and related costs by million and other mg a expenses by million compared to  including reduced facilities costs of million 
other factors contributing to the decrease in other mg a expenses were reduced spending on marketing  advertising and professional fees of million and the write off of property and equipment related to restructuring  which reduced depreciation expense by million 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded a non cash charge of million for amortization of deferred stock compensation in compared to million in and million in deferred stock compensation charges decreased million from to due to the termination of certain employees as part of our january restructuring and to the deferred stock compensation for certain employees becoming fully amortized in deferred stock compensation charges decreased by million in compared to because we accelerated vesting for certain employees terminated as part of our restructurings 
impairment of property and equipment in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting a reduction in the estimated fair value of a product tester 
this equipment was removed from service because lower manufacturing and product development volumes resulted in excess product testing capacity 
there were no impairments of property and equipment in or  other than those assets impaired as a result of our restructurings as described below 
restructuring costs and other special charges in response to the severe economic downturn in the semiconductor industry in  we implemented two restructuring plans aimed at focusing development efforts on key projects and reducing operating costs 
by the first quarter of  we were still operating in a challenging economic climate  making it necessary to again streamline operations and announce a further restructuring 
our assessment of market demand for our products  and the development efforts necessary to meet this demand  were key factors in our decisions to implement these restructuring plans 
because end markets for our products had contracted to such a great degree  certain development projects were curtailed 
cost reductions in all other functional areas were also implemented  as fewer resources were required to support the reduced level of development and sales activities during this period 
we have completed substantially all of the activities contemplated in the original restructuring plans  but have not yet disposed of all surplus leased facilities as of december restructuring march  we had completed the restructuring activities contemplated in the march restructuring plan by june however  we still have ongoing rental commitments for office space abandoned under this plan 
due to the continued downturn in real estate markets  we expect these costs to be higher than anticipated in the original plan 
as a result  we recorded an additional provision for abandoned office facilities of million in the third quarter of payments made in connection with these leases in were million  including amounts drawn down from accrued liabilities 
efforts to exit these sites are ongoing  however  the payments related to these facilities could extend to restructuring october  we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to reduce our operating cost structure 
this restructuring plan included the termination of employees  the consolidation of excess facilities  and the abandonment of certain research and development projects 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of on july   we terminated our remaining rental commitment for mission towers two  located in santa clara  ca  by purchasing the facility for million and then immediately reselling it for million 
we incurred fees of approximately million on these transactions 
upon completion of the sale of mission towers two  we reversed million of excess restructure provision 
the remainder of cash payments made in and the remaining accrual at december  related to other facilities abandoned in the october restructuring 
while we continue our efforts to exit the remaining sites  payments relating to these facilities could extend to restructuring january  in the first quarter of  as a result of the prolonged economic downturn in the semiconductor industry  we implemented another corporate restructuring aimed at further reducing operating expenses 
the restructuring included the termination of approximately employees and the closure of design centers in maryland  ireland and india 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these charges related to workforce reduction  lease and contract settlement costs and the write down of certain property  equipment and software assets whose value was impaired as a result of this restructuring plan 
the restructuring activities contemplated in this plan are substantially complete and we do not expect to have further material charges with respect to this restructuring 
to date  we have made cash payments of million under this plan 
we continue our efforts to exit the remaining sites  however  payments relating to these facilities abandoned under this plan could extend to amortization of goodwill and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles we adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on a prospective basis at the beginning of and stopped amortizing goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas the impact of not amortizing goodwill on the net income and net income per share for and is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas  we completed the transitional impairment test as of the beginning of and determined that a transitional impairment charge would not be required 
we also completed our annual impairment test in december and and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
during the second quarter of  we discontinued further development of the technology purchased in acquisitions completed in market opportunities for one of the products acquired were drastically reduced as our customers eliminated development programs that would use this product as a reaction to the severe reduction in capital spending by service providers 
the reduced market opportunities made further development of this particular product uneconomic 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million  equal to the remaining net book value of goodwill and intangible assets related to this acquisition 
as a result  there was no remaining goodwill or intangibles relating to one of these acquisitions to amortize in the second half of in the fourth quarter of  due to a continued decline in current market conditions and a delay in the introduction of certain products to the market  we completed an assessment of the future revenue potential and estimated costs associated with all acquired technologies 
as a result of this review  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the acquired goodwill and intangibles recognized in a second acquisition in the impairment charge was calculated by the excess of the carrying value of assets over the present value of estimated future cash flow related to these assets 
the impairment charge reduced the amounts subject to amortization for the remainder of interest and other income  net  change change interest and other income  net percentage of net revenues net interest and other income declined in by million  or 
interest and other income for  excluding interest expense and the amortization of debt financing costs  was million as compared to million in and million in interest income declined by approximately million as a result of a decline of average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments  and a further million due to an overall decline in our average cash balances 
our interest expense and amortization of our debt issuance costs in was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in was a result of the repurchase of million in face value of our convertible notes during the third quarter 
in our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding for the entire year compared to less than five months in our net interest income decreased to million in from million in while our interest income declined by approximately million as a result of a decline of average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments  this decline was offset by an additional million in interest income from an overall increase in our cash balances 
interest expense and amortized debt issuance costs increased by million and million respectively 
net gain loss on investments  change change gain loss on investments percentage of net revenues we reported a net gain on investments of million in and net losses of million in and million in in  we sold our remaining investment in sierra wireless  inc  a public company  resulting in a gain of million 
we also recorded a million charge for the impairment of a portion of our investments in non public companies 
in  we recorded a million gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless  inc  as well as other investments 
this gain was offset by a million charge to recognize the impairment of our investments in non public entities 
in  we recorded a million gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless  as well as other investments 
this gain was offset by a million charge to recognize the impairment of our investments in non public entities 
provision for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of  compared to a statutory tax rate of 
our increased effective tax rate reflects an additional recovery of prior year taxes and tax credits received by our canadian subsidiary for research and development expenses incurred 
we are able to recover taxes and tax credits  through cash payments we receive from the canadian government  for our canadian tax losses against amounts paid in taxes in the prior three years 
as we last paid tax in canada in  this is the last year we are able to recover taxes paid when we have losses  until we are profitable and pay taxes again in the future 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
excluding the effects of non deductible amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation  and incremental taxes on foreign earnings  the effective income tax rate for was a recovery of compared to the statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate as a result of a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets  where likelihood of realization is uncertain 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
excluding the effects of non deductible goodwill  deferred stock compensation amortization  impairment of purchased intangibles  and incremental taxes on foreign earnings  the effective income tax rate for was a recovery of compared to the statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for the same reason as in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are reasonable in the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies of revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to major distributors  however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates as they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
restructuring charges facilities in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities we had to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount of sublease revenues 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs for the affected facilities  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease each site 
to form our estimates for these costs we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
during  we recorded total charges of million for the restructuring of excess facilities as part of two restructuring plans 
after elimination of the lease obligation related to mission towers two during  we performed a review of our assumptions relating to the remaining lease commitments using current market conditions for the timing and rates to sublet or cancel the lease for each of the remaining facilities 
based on this analysis we determined that an additional charge of million was required for facilities closure costs due to further deterioration in facilities leasing markets 
the accrual at the end of of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for those affected sites 
in the first quarter of  we announced a further restructuring of our operations  which resulted in the closing of an additional four product development sites two in ireland  one in india and our maryland site 
during the year we recorded total charges of million when we abandoned usage of these sites 
the amount unpaid at the end of the year of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for the effected sites 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until lease termination  or the amounts and timing of offsetting sublease revenues may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
if our actual costs exceed our estimates  we would incur additional expenses in future periods 
inventory we periodically compare our inventory levels to sales forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and record a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
as a result of the downturn in networking equipment demand in and  our inventory of networking products exceeded estimated month demand by million and million in and  respectively  and we recorded a charge of those amounts in those two years 
if future demand for our products were to decline  we may have to take an additional write down of inventory 
income taxes we have incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce our tax liability on those earnings 
as we are uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  we have taken a valuation allowance against all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
our operations are conducted in a number of countries with complex tax regulations 
interpretation of regulations  and legislation pertaining to our activities  and those regulations are continually subject to change 
we have recorded income taxes payable based on our estimate and interpretation of those regulations for the countries we operate in  however those estimates are subject to review and assessment by the tax authorities of those countries 
the timing of the review and assessment of our income tax returns by local authorities is substantially out of our control and is dependent on the actions by those authorities in the countries we operate in 
reviews by tax authorities may result in adjustment of the income taxes we pay or that are refunded 
investment in non public entities we have invested in non public companies and in venture capital funds  which we review periodically to determine if there has been a non temporary decline in the market value of those investments below our carrying value 
our assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies  the current business performance of the entities in which we have invested  and if available  the estimated future market potential of the companies and venture funds 
we recorded an impairment of our investments in non public entities of million in the second quarter of when we perform future assessments of these investments  a further decline in the value of these companies and venture funds may require us to recognize additional impairment on the remaining million carrying value of our investments 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property and equipment  goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events may include a change in business strategy  significant declines in our sales forecast or prolonged negative industry or economic trends 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
for goodwill  an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent than the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting the reduction in fair value of a product tester 
we did not identify any impairment to goodwill or purchased intangibles during our annual assessments in or business outlook we expect our networking revenues for the first quarter of to increase approximately to from the fourth quarter of beyond the first quarter of  we anticipate revenues will improve  but these revenues are subject to changes in customer demand and customer component inventory levels 
we do not anticipate any meaningful revenue from our non networking products in the future as the single medical related product in this revenue category has reached end of life 
we anticipate our gross margins will be in the high range in the first quarter of  but these could vary significantly depending on the volumes and mix of products sold 
we expect slightly elevated operating expenses in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of as we incur additional payroll benefits that are typically incurred in the first half of a calendar year 
we anticipate that interest and other income will increase in compared to as we expect to generate cash from operations and financing activities 
in addition  we have significantly reduced our interest expense through the repurchase of million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe long term trends that impact our operating performance  such service provider infrastructure spending  enterprise network capital spending  communications component inventories  and general economic performance in north america and asia  have stabilized and are beginning to improve 
while we are unable to ascertain the extent to which these factors will affect our operating results  given our broad product and customer range and the complexity of the markets we serve  we believe these trends are positive for our market opportunity over the years to come 
while we participate in a highly volatile industry  we believe we have substantially completed our effort to restructure and re size our financial and operating structure to a sustainable level for the foreseeable future  given our current market opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity at december  was million in cash and investments  which included million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and million of long term investments in bonds and notes which mature within the next to months 
in  we used million of cash for operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts included a million reduction in accrued restructuring costs  primarily due to the settlement of a long term lease obligation at a santa clara  ca 
office facility  a million increase in income taxes payable  an million reduction in inventories  as we continued our efforts to reduce our networking product inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable  as a result of an increase in revenues  a million reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets  as we reduced spending on development software and maintenance in accordance with current cost control programs  and a million decrease in deferred income  as our product shipments by our major distributor exceeded our product shipments to our major distributor 
in cash flows from our investment activities included cash proceeds of million from the sale or maturities of short and long term debt investments  the purchase of million of long and short term debt investments  cash proceeds of million in wafer fabrication deposit refunds  cash proceeds of million from the sale of property and equipment  an investment of million for the purchases of property and equipment  cash proceeds of million from the sale of investments and other assets  million of which was from the sale of the remainder of our investment in sierra wireless inc  a public company  and the purchase of million in venture investments and other real estate assets 
in cash flows from our financing activities included million of cash was used to repurchase million face value of our convertible subordinated notes  and cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our equity based compensation plans 
as of december  we have commitments made up of the following in thousands contractual obligations total after operating lease obligations minimum rental payments estimated operating cost payments long term debt principal repayment interest payments purchase obligations venture investment commitments see below total contractual cash obligations subsequent to december   we repurchased million face value of our convertible subordinated notes at par plus million in accrued interest 
this will reduce the total interest commitments in the above table by million in each of the years  and respectively 
following the repurchase of the notes  we are committed to semi annual interest payments of approximately million to holders of our convertible notes 
these interest payments are due on february and august of each year  with the last payment of interest and million in principal being due on august  purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to purchase design tools and software for use in product development 
we have not included open purchase orders for inventory or other expenses issued in the normal course of business in the purchase obligations shown above 
subsequent to december   we entered into additional purchase obligations related to development tools for million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
in and  we were passive investors  like many of our peers  in four professionally managed venture funds 
these investments help us monitor technological and market developments in the rapidly evolving market in which we participate 
from time to time these funds request additional capital 
in  one of our venture funds reduced our commitment by million as the general partnership was resized to reflect the new venture market environment 
we have committed to invest an additional million into these funds  which may be requested by the fund managers at any time over the next six years 
we have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million provided we maintain eligible investments with the bank equal to the amount drawn on the line of credit 
at december  we had committed million under letters of credit as security for office leases 
we have completed most of our financial and operating restructuring expenditures  including the settlement of our long term mission towers two lease obligation and the repurchase of all but million of our convertible subordinated notes 
we expect to use approximately million of cash in for capital expenditures 
we generated million in cash in the first quarter of by selling our interest in a private company  and cannot estimate what our direct investments in venture backed startups will be in based on our current operating prospects  we believe that existing sources of liquidity will satisfy our projected operating  working capital  venture investing  debt interest  capital expenditure  wafer deposit and remaining restructuring requirements through the end of our expectation as to the sufficiency of our capital resources is based on the assumption that our market has stabilized 
while we believe our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet our long term needs for capital  we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid technological and economic changes 
in addition  we may contemplate mergers and acquisitions of other companies or assets as part of our business strategy 
consequently in the future we may determine that our sources of liquidity are insufficient and we may proceed with financing or other activities  which may dilute your investment or impact our liquidity and operating results 
factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless networking semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in pmc 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results may be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our securities to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we are subject to rapid changes in demand for our products due to customer inventory levels  production schedules  fluctuations in demand for networking equipment and our customer concentration 
we have very limited revenue visibility 
our ability to project revenues is limited because a significant portion of our revenues in a quarter derives from orders placed and shipped in the same quarter  which we call our turns business 
our turns business varies widely quarter to quarter 
customers often request short lead times between order and shipment  which can reduce our visibility 
accordingly we do not project revenues beyond the current quarter  and our projection depends largely on our estimated turns business for the quarter 
recent improvements in our revenues may not continue in our revenues largely depend on end user demand for networking equipment  particularly demand by telecommunications service providers  as our oem customers have increasingly manufactured their products only when they have firm orders to fulfill 
many of our customers have forecast only modest growth in while some of our customers have reported that demand for some of their products has improved  demand may fluctuate from current levels depending on their customers specific needs 
many service providers have limited capital expenditure budgets  and purchase only equipment that can generate rapid financial returns 
many platforms in which our products are designed have been cancelled as our customers cancel or restructure product development initiatives 
further growth of our revenues may be delayed or adversely impacted if these conditions continue or worsen 
our customers actions have reduced our visibility of future revenue streams 
as most of our costs are fixed in the short term  a further reduction in demand for our products may cause a decline in our sales and gross margins 
we may fail to meet our demand forecasts if our customers cancel or delay the purchase of our products 
many of our customers have numerous product lines  numerous component requirements for each product  sizeable and complex supplier structures  and often engage contract manufacturers for additional manufacturing capacity 
this makes forecasting their production requirements difficult and can lead to an inventory surplus of certain of their components 
our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  decide to use competing products  are acquired or divested  market different products  or change production schedules 
customers frequently request shipment of our products at less than our normal lead times 
we may be unable to deliver products to customers when they require them if we incorrectly estimate future demand  and this may lead to higher fluctuations in shipments of our products 
in addition  we believe that uncertainty in our customers end markets and our customers increased focus on cash management has caused our customers to delay product orders and reduce delivery lead time expectations 
this may increase the proportion of our revenues in future periods that will be from orders placed and fulfilled within the same period 
this will decrease our ability to accurately forecast and may lead to greater fluctuations in operating results 
we rely on a few customers for a major portion of our sales  any one of which could materially impact our revenues should they change their ordering pattern 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  cisco systems and hewlett packard each accounted for more than of our fiscal revenues 
we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
the loss of a key customer  or a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we anticipate lower margins on high volume products  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in average selling prices  or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher average selling prices 
yield or other production problems  or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current operating costs 
oems are increasingly price conscious as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in oem equipment 
we have experienced more aggressive price competition from competitors that wish to enter into the market segments in which we participate 
these circumstances may make some of our products less competitive and we may be forced to decrease our prices significantly to win a design 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
in addition  our networking products range widely in terms of the margins they generate 
a change in product sales mix could impact our operating results materially 
design wins do not translate into near term revenues and the timing of revenues from newly designed products is often uncertain 
we have announced a number of new products and design wins for existing and new products 
while some industry analysts may use design wins as a metric for future revenues  many design wins have not  and will not generate any revenues as customer projects are cancelled or rejected by their end market 
in the event a design win generates revenue  the amount of revenue will vary greatly from one design win to another 
in addition  most revenue generating design wins do not translate into near term revenues 
most revenue generating design wins take more than years to generate meaningful revenue 
our restructurings have curtailed our resources and may have insufficiently addressed market conditions 
in and  we announced and implemented plans to restructure our operations in response to the decline in demand for our networking products 
we reduced the work force and consolidated or shut down excess facilities in an effort to bring our expenses into line with our reduced revenue expectations 
while management uses all available information to estimate these restructuring costs  particularly facilities costs  our accruals may prove to be inadequate 
if our actual sublease revenues or exiting negotiations differ from our original assumptions  we may have to record additional charges  which could materially affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
restructuring plans require significant management resources to execute and we may fail to achieve our targeted goals and our expected annualized savings 
we may have incorrectly anticipated the demand for our products  we may be forced to restructure further or may incur further operating charges due to poor business conditions and some of our product development initiatives may be delayed due to the reduction in our development resources 
our revenues may decline if we do not maintain a competitive portfolio of products 
we are experiencing significantly greater competition from many different market participants as the market in which we participate matures 
in addition  we are expanding into markets  such as the wireless infrastructure and generic microprocessor markets  which have established incumbents with substantial financial and technological resources 
we expect fiercer competition than that which we have traditionally faced as some of these incumbents derive a majority of their earnings from these markets 
all of our competitors pose the following threats to us as our customers design next generation systems and select the chips for those new systems  our competitors have an opportunity to convince our customers to use their products  which may cause our revenues to decline 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
our competitors may have more opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because of the shortening product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products 
in addition  as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in oem equipment  oems are becoming more price conscious than in the past 
we have also experienced price aggressiveness from some competitors that wish to enter into the market segments in which we participate 
these circumstances may make some of our products price uncompetitive or force us to match low prices 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
we are facing additional competition from companies who have excess capacity and who are able to offer our oem customers similar products to ours 
excess capacity  in tandem with the reduced demand for oem equipment  has created downward pricing pressure on our products 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological advancement in design tools  wafer manufacturing techniques  process tools and alternate networking technologies 
we may not be able to develop new products at competitive pricing and performance levels 
even if we are able to do so  we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner 
our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation equipment with those of current or future competitors 
increasing competition in our industry will make it more difficult to achieve design wins 
we face significant competition from two major fronts 
first  we compete against established peer group semiconductor companies that focus on the communications semiconductor business 
these companies include agere systems  applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom  exar corporation  conexant systems  marvell technology group  multilink technology corporation  silicon image  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
these companies are well financed  have significant communications semiconductor technology assets  have established sales channels  and are dependent on the market in which we participate for the bulk of their revenues 
other competitors include major domestic and international semiconductor companies  such as agilent  cypress semiconductor  intel  ibm  infineon  integrated device technology  maxim integrated products  motorola  nortel networks  and texas instruments 
these companies are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantial financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate 
this represents a serious competitive threat to us 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which may also have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
these companies  individually or collectively  could represent future competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
we must often redesign our products to meet evolving industry standards and customer specifications  which may prevent or delay future revenue growth 
we sell products to a market whose characteristics include evolving industry standards  short product lifespans  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on high speed networking technologies that have not been widely adopted or ratified by one or more of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers often delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays 
since many of the products we develop do not reach full production sales volumes for a number of years  we may incorrectly anticipate market demand and develop products that achieve little or no market acceptance 
our products generally take between and months from initial conceptualization to development of a viable prototype  and another to months to be designed into our customers equipment and into production 
our products often must be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards or customer specifications 
as a result  we develop products many years before volume production and may inaccurately anticipate our customers needs 
our strategy includes broadening our business into the enterprise  storage and consumer markets 
we may not be successful in achieving significant sales in these new markets 
the enterprise  storage and consumer markets are already serviced by incumbent suppliers who have established relationships with customers 
we may be unsuccessful in displacing these suppliers  or having our products designed into products for different market needs 
in order to compete against incumbents  we may need to lower our prices to win new business  which could lower our gross margin 
we may incur increased research  development and sales costs to address these new markets 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because a significant part of our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are incurred in a variety of currencies around the world 
the us dollar has and may continue to devalue compared to the canadian dollar 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts 
the contracts reduce  but do not eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in addition  this foreign currency risk management policy may not be effective in addressing long term fluctuations since our contracts do not extend beyond a month maturity 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than companies that operate their businesses mostly in the united states  which may impair our sales  development or manufacturing of our products 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than most companies because  in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing is conducted outside the united states 
the geographic diversity of our business operations could hinder our ability to coordinate design and sales activities 
if we are unable to develop systems and communication processes to support our geographic diversity  we may suffer product development delays or strained customer relationships 
we may lose our ability to design or produce products  could face additional unforeseen costs or could lose access to key customers if any of the nations in which we conduct business impose trade barriers or new communications standards 
we may have difficulty obtaining export licenses for certain technology produced for us outside the united states 
if a foreign country imposes new taxes  tariffs  quotas  and other trade barriers and restrictions or the united states and a foreign country develop hostilities or change diplomatic and trade relationships  we may not be able to continue manufacturing or sub assembly of our products in that country and may have fewer sales in that country 
we may also have fewer sales in a country that imposes new communications standards or technologies 
this could inhibit our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and lower our revenues 
changes in political and economic climate in china may have a significant impact on our profitability 
china represents a significant and increasing portion of our net revenues   
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on our sales in china 
any instability in china s economic environment could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers 
additional risks to us include economic sanctions imposed by the us government  implications with regard to travel and trade resulting from the recent sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak  government regulation of exports  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers  uncertain protection for intellectual property rights and generally longer receivable collection periods 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and we may have difficulty collecting receivables from customers based in foreign countries 
many of our customers employ contract manufacturers to produce their products and manage their inventories 
many of these contract manufacturers represent greater credit risk than our networking equipment customers  who generally do not guarantee our credit receivables related to their contract manufacturers 
in addition  international debt rating agencies have significantly downgraded the bond ratings on a number of our larger customers  which had traditionally been considered financially stable 
should these companies enter into bankruptcy proceedings or breach their debt covenants  collection of our significant accounts receivables with these companies could be jeopardized 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
although we  or our customers and our suppliers rigorously test our products  our highly complex products regularly contain defects or bugs 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems that are significant to our customers  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
this could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems with our products 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we may be unsuccessful in transitioning the design of our new products to new manufacturing processes 
many of our new products are designed to take advantage of new manufacturing processes offering smaller manufacturing geometries as they become available  as the smaller geometry products can provide a product with improved features such as lower power requirements  increased performance  more functionality and lower cost 
we believe that the transition of our products to smaller geometries is critical for us to remain competitive 
we could experience difficulties in migrating to future geometries or manufacturing processes  which would result in the delay of the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays  or allow competitors parts to be chosen by customers during the design process 
our business strategy contemplates acquisition of other companies or technologies  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is part of our business strategy 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have an equal or a senior interest 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
we participate in funds that invest in early stage private technology companies to gain access to emerging technologies 
these companies possess unproven technologies and our investments may or may not yield positive returns 
we currently have commitments to invest an additional million in such funds 
as well as consuming significant amounts of cash  these investments are risky because the technologies that these companies are developing may not reach commercialization 
we may record an impairment charge to our operating results should we determine that these funds have incurred a non temporary decline in value 
the loss of personnel could preclude us from designing new products 
to succeed  we must retain and hire technical personnel highly skilled at the design and test functions needed to develop high speed networking products 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we do not have employment agreements in place with many of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of grant and that are subject to vesting 
as our stock price varies substantially  the stock options we grant to employees are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products if we do not accurately predict demand or if we fail to secure adequate wafer fabrication or assembly parts and capacity 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment  our customers are focusing more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and because we supply a large number of products to a variety of customers and contract manufacturers who have many equipment programs for which they purchase our products 
our customers are frequently requesting shipment of our products earlier than our normal lead times 
if we do not accurately predict what mix of products our customers may order  we may not be able to meet our customers demand in a timely manner or we may be left with unwanted inventory 
a shortage in supply could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customer demand  which could adversely affect our customer relationships along with our current and future operating results 
we rely on limited sources of wafer fabrication  the loss of which could delay and limit our product shipments 
we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
three outside foundries supply greater than of our semiconductor device requirements 
our foundry suppliers also produce products for themselves and other companies and thus we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
we depend on third parties in asia for assembly of our semiconductor products that could delay and limit our product shipments 
sub assemblers in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays that  in turn  may result in the loss of revenues 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
our business is vulnerable to interruption by earthquake  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist activity and other events beyond our control 
we do not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to a major earthquake and other calamities 
we have operations in seismically active regions in california  and we rely on third party wafer fabrication facilities in seismically active regions in asia 
we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake in either region  and do not have a recovery plan for earthquake  fire  power loss  terrorist activity or similar disasters 
we are unable to predict the effects of any such event  but the effects could be seriously harmful to our business 
we depend on a limited number of design software suppliers  the loss of which could impede our product development 
a limited number of suppliers provide the computer aided design  or cad  software we use to design our products 
factors affecting the price  availability or technical capability of these products could affect our ability to access appropriate cad tools for the development of highly complex products 
in particular  the cad software industry has been the subject of extensive intellectual property rights litigation  the results of which could materially change the pricing and nature of the software we use 
we also have limited control over whether our software suppliers will be able to overcome technical barriers in time to fulfill our needs 
from time to time  we become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment 
we become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time 
companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability  as well as contract and personal claims 
we may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits  and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure 
these proceedings may result in material charges to our operating results in the future if our exposure is material and if our ability to assess our exposure becomes clearer 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from copying our technology and selling similar products  which would harm our revenues 
to compete effectively  we must protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold several patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation and prevent us from selling our products 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
although we have neither received any material claims relating to the infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties nor are we aware of any such potential claims  we  and our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties in the future 
this has happened in the past 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  or find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents compared to our larger competitors  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our larger competitors and customers 
our customers are required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
we have a significant debt load as a result of the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
as at december  we owed million in convertible subordinated notes 
on january  we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes pursuant to a cash tender offer  leaving approximately million owing after the repurchase 
our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
on august   we are obliged to repay the full remaining principal amount of the notes that have not been converted into our common stock 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
in particular  our stock price declined significantly following announcements made by us and other semiconductor suppliers of reduced revenue expectations and of a general slowdown in the markets we serve 
given these general economic conditions and the reduced demand for our products that we have experienced  we expect that our stock price will continue to be volatile 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of their securities 
if instituted against us  regardless of the outcome  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we could be required to pay substantial damages  including punitive damages  if we were to lose such a lawsuit 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan in  pursuant to which we declared a dividend of one share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
if certain events occur  including if an investor tenders for or acquires more than of our outstanding common stock  stockholders other than the acquirer may exercise their rights and receive worth of our common stock in exchange for per right  or we may  at our option  issue one share of common stock in exchange for each right  or we may redeem the rights for per right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cash equivalents  short term investments and investments in bonds and notes we regularly maintain a short and long term investment portfolio of various types of government and corporate debt instruments 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
maturities of these instruments are less than two and one half years  with the majority being within one year 
to minimize credit risk  we diversify our investments and select minimum ratings of p or a by moody s  or a or a by standard and poor s  or equivalent 
we classify these securities as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we were to sell securities that have declined in market value because of changes in interest rates 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our investment portfolio by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately million  million and million respectively 
other investments we have a number of strategic investments in privately held companies or venture funds that are carried on our balance sheet at cost  net of impairments 
we expect to make additional investments like these in the future 
these investments are inherently risky  as they typically are comprised of investments in companies and partnerships that are still in the start up or development stages 
the market for the technologies or products that they have under development is typically in the early stages  and may never materialize 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment of our other investments of million in response to declining market valuations for these investments 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies and partnerships or may incur an additional expense if we determine that the value of these assets have been further impaired 
subsequent to year end  we sold our interest in a private technology company in exchange for total consideration of million in cash 
we expect to record the disposition of this investment  which had a carrying value of million at december   in the first quarter of foreign currency our sales and corresponding receivables are made primarily in united states dollars 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states including canada  europe  the middle east and asia 
we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
through our operations in canada and elsewhere outside the united states  we incur research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other foreign currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures 
in our effort to manage such risks  we have adopted a foreign currency risk management policy intended to reduce the effects of potential short term fluctuations on our operating results stemming from our exposure to these risks 
as part of this risk management  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries 
these forward contracts offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows or firm commitments 
we limit the forward contracts operational period to months or less and we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
because we do not engage in foreign exchange risk management techniques beyond these periods  our cost structure is subject to long term changes in foreign exchange rates 
as at december   the company had three currency forward contracts outstanding that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges 
the us dollar notional amount of these three contracts was million and the contracts had a fair value of million 
a shift in foreign exchange rates would not have materially impacted our other income because our foreign currency net asset position was immaterial 
debt at december   million of our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding 
subsequent to that date  we repurchased approximately million of these notes at par  leaving approximately million outstanding 
because we pay fixed interest coupons on our notes  market interest rate fluctuations do not impact our debt interest payments 
however  the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes will fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of our common stock  changes in market interest rates and changes in our credit worthiness 
our convertible subordinated notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  but have been traded over the counter  on the portal market or under rule of the securities act of the exchange prices from these trades are not always available to us and may not be reliable 
trades under the portal market do not reflect all trades of the securities and the figures recorded are not independently verified 
the average bid and ask price of our convertible subordinated notes on december  approximated their face value
