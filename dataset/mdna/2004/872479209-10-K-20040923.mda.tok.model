item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
business tii network technologies  inc  formerly named tii industries  inc  and subsidiary together  the company or tii  designs  produces and markets lightning and surge protection products  network interface devices nids  station electronic and other products 
the company has been a leading supplier of overvoltage surge protectors to us telephone operating companies telcos for over years 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments tii s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments 
the company believes that the determination of the carrying value of the company s inventories and long lived assets and establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets are the most critical areas where management s judgments and estimates most affect the company s reported results 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  misinterpretation of the conditions that affect the valuation of these assets could result in actual results varying from reported results  which are based on the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments as of the balance sheet date 
inventories are required to be stated at net realizable value at the lower of cost or market 
in establishing the appropriate inventory write downs  management assesses the ultimate recoverability of the inventory considering such factors as technological advancements in products as required by the company s customers  average selling prices for finished goods inventory  changes within the marketplace  quantities of inventory items on hand  historical usage or sales of each inventory item  forecasted usage or sales of inventory and general economic conditions 
the company reviews long lived assets  such as fixed assets to be held and used or disposed of  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
at june   the company has provided a valuation allowance against all its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing any future benefits there from 
if and when the company s historical and projected pre tax earnings indicate it will be more likely than not  all or a portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized  the company would reduce its valuation allowance  accordingly 
results of operations general over the last several years  a telecommunications industry wide slowdown  cutbacks in construction and maintenance budgets by the telcos and a reduction in the number of their access lines has adversely affected the company 
during this period  the company has been both reducing the cost of its products and its overall cost structure see note of notes to consolidated financial statements while also developing new products in an effort to increase its market share and diversify its customer base 
these actions  combined with an increase of sales over the prior year  have enabled the company to operate profitably for the full fiscal year 
the company s major cusotmer  verizon  has begun its strategy to deploy fiber optic lines to homes and businesses within their region referred to as fiber to the premise  or fttp 
this multi year program is expected to result in a reduction of capital outlays on their traditional copper network and will therefore impact the company s traditional protection based products since fttp networks require less traditional protection than the current copper networks 
though the full extent of the impact on the company of this program is not yet known  the comany believes that the current embedded copper infrastructure will continue to play a significant role as a transmission medium for years to come 
sales of the company s products to telcos are generally through as ordered general supply agreements 
general supply agreements do not require telcos to purchase specific quantities of products and can be terminated  amended or extended for reasons such as changing technologies  product standardizations  or a policy of consolidation of vendors 
the verizon general supply agreement is scheduled to expire in april of however  verizon is in discussions with the company  and the company s competitors to  among other things  incorporate new sealing technologies into the nids that the company is currently supplying under its agreement
