overview the year ended december  was one of the most successful in our history 
we focused on a low risk drilling program in our core areas of operation where we experienced significant increases in oil and natural gas reserves and production 
we drilled wells during  of which were completed  resulting in a success rate 
production from our properties averaged mmcf per day of natural gas and  barrels of oil and natural gas liquids per day  or mmcfe per day for we increased production  from an average of mmcfe per day during the first quarter to an average of mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter 
oil and natural gas reserves increased during to bcfe  which include reserve additions of bcfe  replacing of our net production 
including positive reserve revisions of bcfe  our overall reserve replacement rate was 
we took several major steps during to further strengthen our financial condition  lower interest costs and provide increased financial flexibility 
the balance of our outstanding series a convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock 
this conversion simplified our overall capital structure and eliminated the dividend obligation associated with the preferred stock 
in the first quarter we paid off our maturing senior note obligations 
in the fourth quarter  we amended and restated our bank credit facility  which increased our revolving credit capacity to million and significantly reduced our borrowing costs 
we also completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings under our bank credit facility and to accelerate our drilling program in certain core areas 
our successful drilling program  along with strong oil and natural gas prices and proceeds from our public common stock offering  allowed us to reduce debt from million  or per mcfe of reserves  at the beginning of the year to million  or per mcfe of reserves  at the end of the year 
in the mid continent region  we concentrate our drilling programs primarily in north louisiana  east texas  oklahoma anadarko and arkoma basins and west texas 
our mid continent region operations provide us with a solid base for production and reserve growth 
we plan to continue to exploit areas within the various basins that require low risk exploitation wells for additional reservoir drainage 
our exploitation wells are generally step out and extension type wells with moderate reserve potential 
during  we drilled wells in this region with a success rate of 
we have a multi year inventory of locations in the mid continent region and plan to increase the level of drilling in our elm grove  talihina and joaquin fields and to continue the development program in our sawyer canyon field in in the gulf coast region  we concentrate our drilling programs primarily in south texas 
we also have working interests in several minor non operated offshore and mississippi salt basin properties 
we conduct development programs and pursue moderate risk  higher potential exploration drilling programs in this region 
our gulf coast operations have numerous exploration prospects that are expected to provide us additional growth 
during  we drilled exploratory and development wells in this region with a success rate of 
all of the wells drilled during  except one non operated offshore well  were located in south texas 
we anticipate drilling wells in this region in  approximately half of which will be exploratory 
we believe that the steps taken during position us to grow our reserves and production through a balanced investment program including low risk exploitation and development activities in the mid continent and gulf coast regions and moderate risk  higher potential exploration drilling programs in the onshore gulf coast region 
major influences on results of operations oil and natural gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  including worldwide political conditions especially in the middle east and other oil producing regions  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
the price we receive for our natural gas production is generally to cents below nymex prices 
the primary factors for this differential are the geographic locations of our producing properties and the btu content of our natural gas 
the average btu content of our natural gas is in excess of  btu per cubic foot 
the price we receive for our oil production is generally to below the koch west texas intermediate posted prices for sweet crude in texas new mexico 
our reported realized prices for oil and natural gas are also affected by the production payment we sold in february at a weighted average realized discounted price of per mcfe which has the effect of lowering our reported realized price in periods when cash prices exceed per mcfe and raising our reported realized prices when cash prices are lower than per mcfe 
the effect of the production payment was to reduce realized prices by per mcfe in and to increase realized prices by per mcfe in and per mcfe in certain terminated derivative instruments also affect our reported realized prices 
in february  we terminated per mmbtu swaps on million mmbtu through that we inherited when we acquired medallion california properties company and related entities 
this resulted in a million hedge loss that is being amortized as a non cash reduction of revenue over the original term of the derivative instruments 
the effect of this amortization of the cost of these terminated swaps was to reduce realized prices by  and per mcfe in  and  respectively 
production 
the primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability  the success of our drilling program and  in recent years  the winding down and expiration of our purchased vpp program in in  our main objective was to position ourselves to meet our senior note obligations that were due in january in order to do so  we curtailed our capital spending program and sold certain non core producing properties 
as a result of the property sales and curtailed drilling  our production declined significantly compared to in  with our senior note obligations having been met  we were able to direct our cash flow to our drilling operations and increase production levels throughout the year 
in  bcfe  or  of our production and in  bcfe  or  of our production was derived from our purchased vpp program 
we have not made any vpp investments since as our primary focus since that time has been to add oil and natural gas reserves through the drill bit 
final deliveries under our existing vpps were received in november although specific terms of our vpps varied  we were generally entitled to receive delivery of the scheduled oil and natural gas volumes at agreed delivery points  free of drilling and lease operating expenses and free of state production taxes 
during the life of the program  we invested million to acquire reserves of bcfe of natural gas and oil and realized approximately million from the sale of oil and natural gas acquired as well as an additional bcfe under a vpp that was converted to a working interest 
our reported production includes volumes dedicated to the production payment sold in discussed below 
however  we view the net production after our delivery obligations associated with the production payment as more important because that is what generates cash flow 
for example  while total production declined from bcfe in to bcfe in due to the expiration of purchased vpp s  our net production actually increased from bcfe in to bcfe in as delivery obligations associated with the production payment declined from bcfe in to bcfe in this bcfe increase in net production in resulted in incremental cash flow of approximately million 
sale of production payment 
in february  we sold a bcfe production payment  referred to in this annual report on form k as the production payment  in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy 
the net proceeds from this sale of approximately million was recorded as deferred revenue and is amortized over the five year period that scheduled deliveries of production are made 
deliveries under this production payment are recorded as non cash oil and gas revenue with a corresponding reduction of deferred revenue at the weighted average price of approximately per mcfe 
we also reflect the production volumes and depletion expense as deliveries are made 
however  the associated oil and natural gas reserves are excluded from our oil and natural gas reserve data 
amortization of deferred revenue comprised  and of our oil and gas revenue during  and  respectively 
at december   bcfe remained to be delivered under the production payment of which bcfe will be delivered in  bcfe in and bcfe in operating costs 
we monitor our business to control costs from both a gross dollar standpoint and from a per unit of production perspective 
we are able to control our lease operating expenses largely because we are focused in certain core areas which allows us to operate efficiently 
lease operating expenses were million in  million in and million in in terms of gross dollars  these costs fluctuated primarily due to levels of production and workover activities 
in order to measure our operating performance  we monitor lease operating expenses on a per unit of production basis excluding the production received under our purchased vpp program because volumes received under the purchased vpp program were free from these expenses as discussed above 
lease operating expenses excluding production from purchased vpps per mcfe were in  in and in general and administrative expenses are monitored closely with the objective of operating an efficient organization with an appropriate cost structure 
in and  we reduced our staff in response to limited capital availability and curtailed drilling activity 
in  we added staff modestly in response to our resumed growth 
general and administrative expenses were million  or per mcfe  in  million  or per mcfe in and million  or per mcfe in factors affecting comparability income taxes 
our results included a million non cash income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets while includes a million non cash write down to zero of the book value of net deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of  uncertainty resulting from relatively low commodity prices and the january maturity date for our senior notes led management to increase the valuation allowance by million 
this increase in the valuation allowance reduced the carrying value of net deferred assets to zero 
since that time  we have generated significant levels of taxable income thereby utilizing a portion of our deferred tax asset and the future outlook for taxable income has improved substantially 
oil and natural gas prices have improved significantly and are expected to remain relatively high for the foreseeable future based on existing available information  including current prices quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
therefore  during  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance related to expected taxes on future years taxable income  which is reflected as an income tax benefit in the condensed statements of consolidated operations 
accounting changes 
our results included a million charge against earnings related to our change to the unit of production method of accounting for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation and recorded a million charge against earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
sale of emission credits 
we sold emission credits totaling million and million in and  respectively 
we did not sell any emission credits in we currently do not anticipate any significant emission credit sales in purchased vpps 
as discussed above under major influences on results of operations production  the decision to cease purchases of vpps in and the expiration of volumes received under the purchased vpp program affects the comparability of our production  lease operating expenses and production taxes 
stock compensation 
stock compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these non cash expenses reflect the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses associated with certain stock options granted in that are subject to variable accounting 
the stock option expenses can fluctuate significantly as the expense recognized during a reporting period is directly related to the movement in the market price of our common stock during that period 
reorganization 
in  we conducted a reorganization in bankruptcy  and the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware confirmed our plan of reorganization in under the reorganization plan  holders of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes received all accrued and unpaid interest  our senior noteholders received a partial pre payment of principal  our trade creditors were paid in full and our stockholders retained of their common stock  subject to dilution upon conversion of the million of series a convertible preferred stock sold in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy 
the consolidated statement of operations for included million of net costs associated with the reorganization 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following discussion details the more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities i the successful efforts method and ii the full cost method 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs into one country wide cost center 
these costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  equipment  certain salaries and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
these costs are then amortized over the remaining life of the aggregate oil and natural gas reserves using the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense discussed below under amortization of oil and gas properties 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and gas exploration business and are therefore capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
as a result  we believe the full cost method of accounting is appropriate and accurately reflects the economics of our programs for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
under the successful efforts method  costs of exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs that would be capitalized under the full cost method would be charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur 
accordingly  our financial position and results of operations may have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also may change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  as we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves have been audited or prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
amortization of oil and gas properties effective january   we began amortizing the capitalized costs related to our oil and gas properties under the unit of production  or uop  method using proved oil and natural gas reserves 
under the uop method  the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate is computed based on the ratio of production to total reserves 
this rate is applied to the amortizable base of our oil and gas properties the net book value of oil and gas properties less the costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties plus estimated future costs to develop the oil and gas properties with proved reserves 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization requires the use of significant estimates pertaining to oil and natural gas reserves and future development costs 
bad debt expense we routinely review all material trade and other receivables to determine the timing and probability of collection 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
therefore  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
we market the majority of our production and these receivables are generally collected within a month 
the receivables for the remaining production are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve for a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is doubtful that the receivable will be collected in full and the amount of any reserve required can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition oil and natural gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collection of the revenue is probable 
we follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues 
under this method of accounting  revenues are recognized based on actual production volume sold 
the volume of natural gas sold may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our working interest 
an imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under produced owner s to recoup its entitled share through future production 
natural gas imbalances can arise on properties for which two or more owners have the right to take production in kind 
in a typical gas balancing arrangement  each owner is entitled to an agreed upon percentage of the property s total production 
however  at any given time  the amount of natural gas sold by each owner may differ from its allowable percentage 
two principal accounting practices have evolved to account for natural gas imbalances 
these methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas sales method or an owner s entitled share of the current period s production entitlement method 
we have elected to use the sales method 
if we used the entitlement method  our reported revenues may have been materially different 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  we perform an extensive analysis of our operations to determine the sources of future taxable income 
the analysis consists of a detailed review of all available data  including our budget for the ensuing year  forecasts based on current as well as historical prices  and the independent petroleum engineers reserve report 
the determinations to establish and adjust a valuation allowance requires significant judgment as the estimates used in preparing budgets  forecasts and reserve reports are inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision as a result of changes in the outlook for prices  production volumes and costs  among other factors 
it is difficult to predict with precision the timing and amount of taxable income we will generate in the future 
our current net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately million have remaining lives ranging from to years  with the majority having a life in excess of years 
however  we examine a much shorter time horizon  usually two to three years  when projecting estimates of future taxable income and making the determination as to whether the valuation allowance should be adjusted 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments as most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and because contracts and regulations often contain vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the periods in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  as a result  net property  plant and equipment was increased by million  an asset retirement obligation of million was recorded and a million charge against net income was reported in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
requires a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception 
we  therefore  calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance 
the sum of these cumulative expenses was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded 
as the historically recorded depletion was lower than the cumulative expense calculated under sfas no 
 the difference resulted in a loss that we recorded as cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  upon implementation  we also had to determine if the statement required us to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling test 
we chose not to recalculate our historical full cost ceiling test even though our historical oil and gas property balance would have been higher had we applied the statement from its inception 
we believe this approach is appropriate because sfas no 
is silent on this issue and was not effective during the prior implementation test periods 
if a recalculation of the historical full cost ceiling test resulted in impairment  the charge would have increased the cumulative loss recorded upon adoption and reduced depletion expense subsequent to adoption 
we also had to determine how to incorporate the asset retirement obligations into our quarterly calculations of our full cost ceiling test 
sfas no 
is silent with respect to this issue and although there are various views  we elected to continue to include the capitalized cost of our asset retirement obligation in our oil and gas property balance and exclude the cash outflow associated with future abandonment cost from future development cost when calculating the pre tax present value of our future net revenues 
this results in both a higher ceiling test threshold and a higher net oil and gas property balance 
another widely contemplated view is to include the undiscounted asset retirement obligation as part of future development cost  essentially reducing the pre tax present value of future net revenues and to net the asset retirement obligation recorded on the balance sheet against the oil and gas property balance 
we believe that our approach is more conservative although at the present time there is no material difference in our ceiling test calculation using either of these methods 
prospectively  our depletion expense will be reduced because we will deplete a discounted asset retirement cost rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted 
the lower depletion expense under sfas no 
is offset  however  by higher accretion expense  which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time 
derivatives we use commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we account for our commodity derivative contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
realized gains and losses from our cash flow hedges  including terminated contracts  are generally recognized in oil and natural gas production revenue when the hedged volumes are produced and sold 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
results of operations income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change for was million compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher natural gas and oil prices and the sale of emission reduction credits  partially offset by decreased oil and natural gas production due to the expiration of our volumetric production payment  or vpp  program and the effect of the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties in income tax benefit for was million compared to an income tax expense of million in due to changes in our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect of accounting change was million  or a loss per basic and diluted share  in resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
in  the cumulative effect of accounting change was million  or a loss per basic and diluted share  which reflected the change from the future gross revenue method of accounting for amortization of capitalized costs related to oil and gas properties to the unit of production method 
income available to common stockholders in was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to a loss of million  or per basic and diluted share in income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change for was million compared to million in dramatically lower natural gas prices  lower non oil and natural gas revenue and lower production were partially offset by significantly lower operating  reorganization and interest expenses 
income tax expense for was million compared to an income tax benefit of million in we reported a net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or per basic and diluted share  as a result of the non cash income tax expense in in  the cumulative effect of accounting change to the unit of production method of amortization of oil and gas property costs was a million loss  or a per basic and diluted share

natural gas revenue 
in  natural gas revenue was million compared to million in as a result of a increase in realized natural gas prices and a decrease in production 
the production decrease was primarily due to the expiration of our vpp program  as new production from the successful drilling program essentially offset the impact of property sales and the natural decline of producing wells 
in  natural gas revenue was million compared to million in as a result of a decrease in realized natural gas prices and a decline in production 
the production decline was primarily due to the sale of oil and gas properties and the expiration of certain volumetric production payments 
furthermore  the natural decline of producing properties was not fully offset by new production largely due to our curtailed capital investment program 
oil and liquids revenue 
in  oil and liquids revenue increased million to million primarily due to a increase in the weighted average realized price offset by a decrease in production 
the decrease in production was attributable to the sale of non core oil and gas properties in and natural decline of oil properties as the drilling program focused almost entirely on natural gas prospects 
in  oil and liquids revenue decreased million to million primarily due to a decrease in production 
the decrease in production in was attributable to the sale of oil and gas properties and the natural declines of producing properties 
other  net 
other  net was million in compared to a net cost of million in the increase was primarily attributed to the sale of emission reduction credits 
we do not anticipate that there will be any significant sales of emission credits in other  net decreased from million in to a net cost of million in of the million in  million was from the sale of emission reduction credits and million was from non cash gains on derivative instruments that were not designated as oil and natural gas hedges when we adopted sfas no 
the remainder was primarily attributable to marketing and transportation revenue incidental to our oil and gas operations 
in  the net cost of million was primarily attributable to marketing and transportation activities 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december   lease operating expenses  or loe  increased to million  compared to million in on a per unit basis  loe was per mcfe of working interest production in compared to per mcfe in the increase was primarily attributed to a higher level of workover activity on oil and gas wells in for the year ended december   loe decreased to million per mcfe of working interest production  compared to million per mcfe of working interest production in increased focus on cost reductions and operating efficiency along with lower production largely due to the sale of certain non core properties contributed to the reductions 
production taxes production taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in production taxes are generally based on a percentage of revenue  excluding revenue from our now terminated vpp program 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher oil and natural gas revenue associated with higher average realized prices and higher production tax rates in louisiana where we significantly increased our production in the elm grove field 
production taxes decreased million to million in compared to million in due to lower oil and natural gas revenue associated with the decrease in working interest production and lower average realized prices 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease resulted from lower labor costs associated with a reduced work force  partially offset by a higher incentive compensation expense resulting from improved operating results 
general and administrative expenses in decreased million to million compared to million in the decrease in resulted from lower labor costs associated with a reduced work force  partially offset by an increase in insurance premiums and employment severance payments 
stock compensation stock compensation reflects the non cash expense associated with stock options issued in that are subject to variable accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  or fin  and the non cash expense associated with the amortization of restricted stock grants 
under variable accounting for stock options  the amount of expense recognized during a reporting period is directly related to the movement in the market price of our common stock during that period 
for  stock compensation was million compared to million in primarily due to the significant increase in the market price of our common stock during stock compensation was million in compared to million in these amounts reflect the non cash amortization of restricted stock grants 
no expense was recorded pursuant to fin as the options subject to variable accounting discussed above were out of the money during and the expense amount includes incremental costs associated with initial grants made upon our emergence from bankruptcy to compensate for a portion of stock options previously issued but cancelled in connection with our plan of reorganization 
bad debt expense bad debt expense was million in compared to million in bad debt expense was million in  primarily due to an allowance against receivables due from various enron entities that are now in bankruptcy for oil and natural gas sales and derivative instruments 
we ceased all sales to enron entities after november accretion of asset retirement obligation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accretion of our asset retirement obligation was million in depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million compared to for the year ended december  this million decrease was primarily attributable to reduced production as a result of the expiration of our vpp program and the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties in effective january   we began amortizing our oil and gas properties using the uop method based on proved reserves 
this change resulted in additional amortization of million through december   which is classified as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  in for the year ended december   depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million to million 
the decrease reflects reduced production and a lower depletable base 
interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in and million in these amounts primarily represent interest income earned on accumulated cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the higher interest expense in reflects the million write off of deferred financing costs and a million early termination fee paid to a previous lender as a result of amending and restating our bank credit facility in november to increase availability and reduce future interest costs 
interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs was million lower in compared to primarily due to lower average outstanding debt in in  we anticipate a significant reduction in interest expense as a result of lower interest rates associated with our amended and restated bank credit facility and lower average borrowings following our public common stock offering 
the proceeds of our public common stock offering were initially used to repay debt 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease reflected the trend of lowering outstanding debt and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates on the bank credit facility  partially offset by a million write off of deferred financing costs in december reorganization items we completed our bankruptcy proceedings in accordingly  there were no reorganization items in or for the year ended december   we recorded million of reorganization items  primarily for legal and financial advisory services in connection with our completed bankruptcy proceedings 
income taxes income tax benefits were million in compared to income tax expense of million in and income tax benefits of million in these amounts reflect changes in our valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets 
during the second quarter of  uncertainty resulting from relatively low commodity prices and the january maturity date for our senior notes led management to increase the valuation allowance by million 
this increase in the valuation allowance reduced the carrying value of net deferred assets to zero 
since that time  we have generated significant levels of taxable income thereby utilizing a portion of our deferred tax asset and the future outlook for taxable income has improved substantially 
oil and natural gas prices have improved significantly and are expected to remain relatively high for the foreseeable future based on existing available information  including current prices quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
therefore  during  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance related to expected taxes on future years taxable income  which is reflected as an income tax benefit in the condensed statements of consolidated operations 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a liability of million representing the fair market value of our derivative instruments upon adoption and an after tax charge to other comprehensive income of million from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during  we reclassified million of the liability as a non cash reduction to oil and natural gas revenues and reduced the valuation allowance related primarily to net operating losses  for a related tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources improved significantly during in january  we amended and restated our bank credit facility to increase our borrowing availability and paid off the maturing senior note obligations 
we also accelerated our drilling program  resulting in increased production and oil and natural gas reserves 
we drilled wells during with a success rate of 
we increased production  from an average of mmcfe per day during the first quarter to an average of mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter 
the increase in production coupled with a strong natural gas and oil price environment resulted in a substantial increase in cash flow as discussed below 
we took several major steps during to further strengthen our financial condition  lower interest costs and provide increased financial flexibility 
the balance of our outstanding series a convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock 
this conversion simplified our overall capital structure and eliminated the dividend obligation associated with the preferred stock 
in the first quarter we paid off our maturing senior note obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we amended and restated our bank credit facility  which increased our revolving credit capacity to million and significantly reduced our borrowing costs 
we also completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings under our bank credit facility and to accelerate our drilling program in certain core areas 
our successful drilling program  along with strong oil and natural gas prices and proceeds from our public common stock offering  allowed us to reduce debt during from million  or per mcfe of reserves  at the beginning of the year to million  or per mcfe of reserves  at the end of the year 
with the completion of the steps outlined above  we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on the current strong natural gas and oil price environment  to focus on developing our multi year prospect inventory  to increase reserves and production in our core areas and to further reduce debt per mcfe 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  operating expenses and debt service 
for  we have budgeted million for capital investments in natural gas and oil properties and anticipate drilling over wells 
of the million  we anticipate spending approximately million in the elm grove field  million at the joaquin field  million at the sawyer canyon field  million at the talihina field  million at other mid continent properties  million on the gulf coast exploration program and million on the gulf coast development drilling program 
we expect to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows 
the amount and allocation of our capital investment program is subject to change based on operational developments  commodity prices  service costs  acquisitions and numerous other factors 
generally  we do not budget for acquisitions 
we believe that cash on hand  net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital expenditure program and satisfy our liquidity needs 
in the future  we may also utilize various financing sources  including the issuance of debt or equity securities under our shelf registration statement or through private placements 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our financial condition 
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in the improvement in our cash flow in was primarily due to higher realized oil and natural gas prices and substantially less production dedicated to repayment of the production payment 
the net increase in trade accounts receivable reflects the higher natural gas and oil price environment in and the timing of cash receipts 
the net change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily attributable to increased drilling well pre payments received from non operating working interest owners and higher incentive compensation accruals 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in cash provided by operating activities in was significantly impacted by the execution of our plan of reorganization  which included net proceeds of million from the production payment sold in february  the payment of million of interest expense including million that pertained to prior years and the million cost of terminating certain derivative instruments in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy 
cash provided by operating activities during was negatively impacted by lower realized natural gas prices and lower production 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  including million invested in oil and gas properties  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in in  we invested million in oil and gas properties and realized million from the sale of non core properties 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including million used for development activities  million used for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling and million used for other assets 
these amounts include costs that were incurred and accrued as of december  but are not reflected in the net cash used in investing activities above until payment is made in capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including million used for development activities  million used for the acquisition of proved reserves and million used for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including million used for development activities  million used for the acquisition of proved reserves  million used for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling and million used for other assets 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in in  net proceeds from the common stock offering were million  proceeds from borrowings under the bank credit facility were million  repayments of debt were million and net payments of deferred financing costs and other were million 
in  proceeds from borrowings were million  repayments of debt were million and payments for deferred financing costs and other were million 
shelf registration statement common stock offering on september   we  along with two of our operating subsidiaries  kcs resources  inc and medallion california properties company  filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement covers the issuance of an unspecified amount of senior unsecured debt securities  senior subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants  units or guarantees  or a combination of those securities 
we may  in one or more offerings  offer and sell common stock  preferred stock  warrants and units 
we may also  in one or more offerings  offer and sell senior unsecured and senior subordinated debt securities 
under our shelf registration statement  our senior unsecured and senior subordinated debt securities may be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by kcs resources  inc and medallion california properties company 
on november   in a public offering under our shelf registration statement  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share 
on december   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option and we sold an additional million shares of common stock at per share 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately million from the public offering and the exercise of the over allotment option to repay borrowings under our bank credit facility and to accelerate our drilling program in certain core areas  including the elm grove  joaquin and talihina fields  where we have accumulated a substantial drilling prospect inventory 
as of december   there were million remaining under our shelf registration statement 
bank credit facility on november   we amended and restated our bank credit facility with a group of commercial bank lenders 
the bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  and to support our capital expenditure program 
the bank credit facility provides up to million of revolving borrowing capacity and matures on november  the maturity date will be october  if our senior subordinated notes are not fully refinanced or repaid by october  borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base initially set at million and is reviewed at least semi annually and may be adjusted based on the lenders valuation of our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors 
substantially all of our assets  including the stock of all of our subsidiaries  are pledged to secure the bank credit facility 
further  each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed our obligations under the bank credit facility 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest  at our option  at an interest rate of libor plus to or the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the base rate  plus to  depending on utilization 
these rates will decrease by after the final deliveries are made in connection with the production payment discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and the lien on the subject property is released 
a commitment fee of per year is paid on the unused availability under the bank credit facility 
financing fees pertaining to the bank credit facility are being amortized over the life of the facility 
deferred financing fees of million associated with the bank credit facility prior to it being amended and restated in november and an early termination fee of million paid to a previous lender were charged to interest expense during the fourth quarter of the bank credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including minimum levels of liquidity and interest coverage 
the bank credit facility also contains other usual and customary terms and conditions of a conventional borrowing base facility  including requirements for hedging a portion of our oil and natural gas production  prohibitions on a change of control  prohibitions on the payment of cash dividends  restrictions on certain other distributions and restricted payments  and limitations on the incurrence of additional debt and the sale of assets 
financial covenants require us to  among other things maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  other non cash charges and exploration expenses minus amortization of deferred revenue attributable to production payment sold in february to cash interest payments of at least to  maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities excluding the current portion of indebtedness for borrowed money and the face amount of letters of credit of not less than to until march   to from april until september  and to at all times after september  any unused portion of the commitment amount of the bank credit facility is deemed to be a current asset of ours for purposes of this calculation  and not enter into hedging transactions covering more than of projected production from our proved developed producing reserves for the period of such transactions 
the bank credit facility also contains customary events of default  including any defaults by us in the payment or performance of any other indebtedness equal to or exceeding million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the bank credit facility  the weighted average interest rate was and million was available for additional borrowings we were also in compliance with all covenants under the bank credit facility as of that date 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than in thousands of dollars total year years years years long term debt   operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations    the above table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration cost of oil and gas properties 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other commercial commitments in connection with the production payment  we have obligations to deliver bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in as of december   we had million of surety bonds that remain outstanding until specific events or projects are completed and any claims that may be made are settled 
as of december   we had outstanding a million standby letter of credit supporting hedge transactions with one counterparty 
this letter of credit was cancelled upon the settlement of the related hedges in the first quarter of off balance sheet arrangements we do not utilize and are not currently contemplating using any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions or for any other purpose 
any future transactions involving off balance sheet arrangements will be scrutinized and disclosed by our management 
new accounting principles effective january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 our net property  plant and equipment was increased by million  an additional asset retirement obligation of million primarily for plugging and abandonment costs of oil and gas wells was recorded and a million charge  net of tax against net income or a loss per basic and diluted share was reported in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to adoption  the effect of the change in accounting principle was a million additional non cash charge against income 
effective january   we began amortizing the capitalized costs related to oil and gas properties on the unit of production  or uop  method using proved oil and natural gas reserves 
previously  we had computed amortization on the basis of future gross revenue 
we determined that the change to the uop method was preferable under gaap as  among other reasons  it provides a more rational basis for amortization during periods of volatile commodity prices and also increases consistency with others in the industry 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of million  net of tax  or per basic and diluted common share in the first quarter of in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity  or vie  if it has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that is exposed to a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
in addition  more extensive disclosure requirements apply to the primary and other significant variable interest owners of the vie 
this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin is also generally effective for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to vies in which a company holds a variable interest that is acquired before february  we have concluded that we do not have any interest in vies and that this interpretation has no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards on how we classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that we classify as liabilities the fair value of all mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that had previously been recorded as equity or elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective for all existing financial instruments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal sfas no 
did not impact our classification of our previously outstanding convertible preferred stock because the convertible preferred stock was not mandatorily redeemable as defined by sfas no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no  goodwill and intangible assets  were issued by the fasb in june and became effective for us on july  and january   respectively 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
additionally  sfas no 
requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
depending on how the accounting and disclosure literature is applied  oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds may be classified separately from oil and gas properties  as intangible assets on our balance sheets 
in addition  the disclosures required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to financial statements 
historically  we  like most other oil and gas companies  have included these oil and natural gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves as part of the oil and gas properties  even after sfas no 
and sfas no 
became effective 
our results of operations and cash flows would not be affected  as these oil and natural gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves would continue to be accounted for in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
at december  and december   we had leaseholds of approximately million and million  respectively that would be reclassified from oil and gas properties to intangible leaseholds on our consolidated balance sheets if we applied the interpretations 
these figures represent the costs incurred  net of amortization  since june   the effective date of sfas no 
amounts prior to june  were not identified since our accounting procedures were not designed to account for leaseholds separately 
these classifications would require us to make disclosures set forth under sfas no 
related to these interests 
we will continue to classify our oil and natural gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all information and statements included in this section  other than historical information and statements  are forward looking statements 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is to oil and natural gas prices  which have historically been volatile 
realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional spot prices for natural gas production 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  derivative contracts  including swaps  futures contracts  options and collars to manage this price risk 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
while these derivative contracts are structured to reduce our exposure to decreases in the price associated with the underlying commodity  they also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from price increases 
we maintain a system of controls that includes a policy covering authorization  reporting  and monitoring of derivative activity 
as of december   we had no outstanding derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we had derivative instruments outstanding covering mmbtu of natural gas production and million barrels of oil production  with a fair market value of million 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our oil and natural gas hedged position as of december  expected maturity  fair value at st nd rd th december  quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands swaps oil volumes bbl      weighted average price bbl natural gas volumes mmbtu      weighted average price mmbtu collars natural gas volumes mmbtu     weighted average price mmbtu floor cap way collars natural gas volumes mmbtu   weighted average price mmbtu floor purchased put option

the fair value of our derivative instruments was million as of december  as compared to none as of december  in addition to the information set forth in the table above  we will deliver bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in under the production payment sold in february and amortize deferred revenue at a weighted average price of per mcfe 
during  we delivered approximately of our production under the production payment and amortized deferred revenue at the weighted average realized price of per mcfe and also entered into derivative arrangements designed to reduce price downside risk for approximately of the balance of our production 
during  we delivered approximately of our production under the production payment sold in february at a weighted average discounted price of per mcfe and also entered into derivative contracts that covered approximately of the balance of our production 
commodity price swaps 
commodity price swap agreements require us to make or receive payments from the counter parties based upon the differential between a specified fixed price and a price related to those quoted on the new york mercantile exchange for the period involved 
futures contracts oil or natural gas futures contracts require us to sell and the counter party to buy oil or natural gas at a future time at a fixed price 
option contracts 
option contracts provide the right  not the obligation  to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price 
by buying a put option  we are able to set a floor price for a specified quantity of our oil or natural gas production 
by selling a call option  we receive an upfront premium from selling the right for a counter party to buy a specified quantity of oil or natural gas production at a fixed price 
price collars 
selling a call option and buying a put option creates a collar whereby we establish a floor and ceiling price for a specified quantity of future production 
buying a call option with a strike price above the sold call strike establishes a way collar that entitles us to capture the benefit of price increases above that call price 
interest rate risk we use fixed and variable rate long term debt to finance our capital spending program and for general corporate purposes 
the variable rate debt instruments expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt and the associated weighted average interest rate was million at as of december  and million at as of december  our variable rate debt and weighted average interest rate was million at as of december  and million at as of december  the tables below present principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity date for our debt obligations as of december  and dollars in millions
