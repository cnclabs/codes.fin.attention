table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part iv of this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements  such as our projections about future results of operations that are inherently uncertain 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect our business in this item 
introduction our current efforts are focused on improving cash flows  manufacturing products and entering into relationships to market and sell our products 
management s objective is to manufacture and sell products in order to generate sufficient cash flows to sustain the company s operations 
our cash balance was million at december  we have incurred negative operating cash flows of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we have reduced all research and development expenditures not supporting product development 
any further significant reductions will impede our ability to develop and manufacture products 
on march   we sold  shares of common stock at a share and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in a private placement with gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds after expenses of approximately million 
the warrants include an anti dilution provision in connection with any future issuance of our securities at a price below the exercise price 
however  the warrant shares cannot be issued at an exercise price below per share 
these funds combined with our existing resources  are expected to sustain our operations through we will require substantial additional working capital to continue our product development programs and to fund our future operations 
overview current significant financial and operating events and strategies are summarized as follows product focus we have shifted our focus from proteomic tools and services to therapeutic protein and vaccine products and diagnostic tests 
our current primary product focus is alpha galactosidase a enzyme replacement therapy product and aprotinin 
both of these products have remaining development periods extending past for the pharmaceutical market 
although no assurances can be given  we project sales of research grade aprotinin beginning in the third quarter of commercialization of our bamf technology for diagnostic tests of cancer and other diseases is in an early stage of commercialization 
cancellation of niehs contract will have a small long term effect on loss from operations the national institute of environmental health services niehs contract with us was terminated for the government s convenience after an agreed upon wind down period ending on december  our performance under the contract including sample analysis  reports and data deliverables has been in strict conformance with contract specified research protocols and timetables 
as a result of the termination of the niehs contract and consistent with our product refocus  we have ceased operating activities at our germantown  maryland facility and are in the process of eliminating any remaining operating costs 
we expect that these cost savings will offset the decrease in 
table of contents revenues and the termination of the niehs contract will have a small long term effect on loss from operations 
continued cost reductions we implemented a company wide restructuring in june that reduced our headcount and cancelled certain consulting and outside service contracts 
cost reductions continued into with our reorganization in june and wind down of our germantown  maryland proteomics operations 
these reorganizations eliminated several management positions and the board of directors appointed kevin j 
ryan as president and chief executive officer and promoted ronald j 
artale to chief operating officer 
the total number of full time permanent employees declined from in to in march  a decrease of 
we recorded million of severance benefits during comprised of million in the second quarter related to our reorganization and million in the fourth quarter related to the wind down of our germantown  maryland operations 
the wind down of our germantown  maryland operations resulted in impairment charges of million in that reduced the carrying value of property  plant and equipment 
current projections indicate that further impairment charges will not be required 
however  no assurances can be made that events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may be impaired 
also  upon the disposal of certain germantown  maryland assets  we will incur charges that may be partially or totally offset by income 
results of operations revenues the following table presents the changes in revenues from through increase from decrease from amount amount revenues revenues in and  primarily attributed to research contracts and grants  have offset costs  but have not been sufficient to sustain the company operations 
the increase in revenues from to is attributable to the niehs contract 
the niehs contract revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
we believe that the loss of revenues from the termination of the niehs contract will have a limited long term effect on our loss from operations  since the costs associated with this contract are in the process of being eliminated 
the decrease in revenues from to is primarily attributed to the completion of the research collaboration with the dow chemical company and its subsidiary  dow agrosciences llc dow in august dow associated revenues were million in we expect that quarterly revenues will be lower in the first half of than as a result of the cancellation of the niehs contract 
however  we expect quarterly revenue increases with our first product sales of research grade aprotinin starting in the third quarter of cost and expenses the cost reduction programs and reorganizations during and and the wind down of the germantown  maryland operations have significantly reduced costs and cash expenditures throughout the company 
from to expenses decreased million for employee compensation and benefits  million for outside consulting and research services  million for patent application legal services  and million for materials purchases 
in addition  non cash depreciation decreased million  non cash compensation decreased million  non cash amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles decreased by million and non cash impairment charges increased by million 

table of contents development agreements and research and development costs the following table presents the changes in total research activities from through increase decrease from decrease from amount amount development agreements research development total research activities development agreements and research and development costs consist mainly of personnel expenses  outside research services  research materials and laboratory overhead costs 
costs of total research activities have decreased significantly because of our product refocus and cost reduction efforts 
development agreement costs  as they related to activities performed under revenue generating research agreements and grants  have and are expected to fluctuate consistently with increases or decreases in revenues earned from research agreements and grants 
specifically in  the increased development agreement costs are attributed to increased research activities in the amount of million for the niehs contract and million for the nist grant  partially offset by decreased efforts performed under commercial contracts 
the decrease in research and development expense in is attributed to this allocation of resources to customer projects and the cost reductions efforts including million for employee compensation and benefits from headcount and salary reductions  million for outside consulting and research services  and million for materials purchases 
in addition  non cash depreciation decreased million and non cash compensation decreased million 
we expect that our research and development expenses will be lower in than as the annualized effect of cost reductions are realized 
we expect to incur costs of product sold as we begin to manufacture and sell our first product 
the decrease in development agreement costs in from is primarily attributable to the completion of our research collaboration with dow in august the decrease research and development costs in from is primarily attributable to the company wide restructuring in june that reduced the company s headcount and the cancellation of certain consulting and outside research services 
general and administrative the following table presents the changes in general and administrative expenses from through decrease from decrease from amount amount general administrative general and administrative expenses have decreased significantly because of our cost reduction efforts including million for patent application legal service and million for employee compensation and benefits from headcount and salary reductions  partially offset by increases in other costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be lower than as the annualized effect of cost reductions are realized 
impairment of property the wind down of our germantown  maryland operations resulted in impairment charges of million in that reduced the carrying value of property  plant and equipment 
in  we determined that certain machinery and equipment  related to our germantown  maryland operation  was permanently idle and as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million 

table of contents impairment of goodwill our goodwill balance of million related to our purchase of the germantown  maryland operations in  was determined to be impaired and was written off at december  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangible assets relate to the purchase of our germantown  maryland operations in amortization expense decreased million in from  as goodwill was no longer amortized effective january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
however  amortization of purchased intangibles continued until those assets became fully amortized in  resulting in decreased amortization expense of million in from interest income the decreased interest income of million in and of million in is attributable to our declining cash and marketable securities balances available for investment and significant reductions in interest yields 
we expect interest income in to be lower than due to the declining cash and marketable securities balances 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities the following table presents annual cash flows from operating activities from through year ended december  cash paid to employees cash paid to suppliers total cash paid to employees and suppliers cash received from customers interest received interest paid net cash used in operating activities due to our cost reductions programs and reorganizations during and  we progressively decreased the amount of total cash paid to employees and suppliers from through the net cash used in operating activities increased from to because of the lower amount of cash received from customers related to the ending of the dow research collaboration  and less interest received related to the declining investment balances and interest yields 
the net cash used in operating activities decreased from to because of the decreased total cash paid to employees and suppliers related to our cost reduction programs 
the following table presents quarterly cash flows from operating activities during quarters ended  december september june march cash paid to employees cash paid to suppliers total cash paid to employees and suppliers cash received from customers interest received interest paid net cash used in operating activities 
table of contents during  we progressively decreased the quarterly net cash used in operating activities 
cash paid to employees include severance benefits of   and  in the quarters ended december  september and june  respectively 
the improvement in our operating cash usage is attributable to our cost reduction efforts 
we expect the negative operating cash flows to continue throughout at a similar rate as the fourth quarter 
however  this rate of cash usage is not sustainable for a long term period 
our ability to develop our products and sustain operations will require subsequent funding through collaborations  or debt or equity financing in the short term and product sales in the long term 
although product sales would increase our short term usage of cash for inventory and cost of product sold  it is expected that they would eventually generate positive cash flows 
cash used in investing activities capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and respectively 
we have no material capital expenditure commitments at december  we anticipate that in our biomanufacturing facility in owensboro  kentucky will require approximately million of expenditures to support our business objectives 
such capital expenditures will be financed through the recently completed equity financing 
net cash provided used in by financing activities in  we received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering  which has sustained the company s operations since that time 
financing activities have not provided significant cash flows from through the net cash use by financing activities in is attributable to debt repayments 
interest rates could be increased or payments accelerated for our long term note payable with a balance of  at december  if certain levels of employment are not increased at our owensboro  kentucky facility 
we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding at any time 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
commitments the following commitments table presents our non cancelable minimum payments under contractual obligations as of december  payments due and and thereafter total long term debt accrued stock compensation operating leases research agreements license agreements total commitments we lease facilities in vacaville  california and germantown  maryland under operating leases 
we have research sponsorship agreements with major universities  government institutions or other companies whereby we fund specific projects of interest to us 
in addition to the future non cancelable minimum payments above  certain of the research agreements require future aggregate payments of  if the agreements are not cancelled 
our long term accrued stock compensation relates to employee restricted stock awards that can be settled by us 
table of contents in stock or cash  unless certain cash flow objectives are met  and then  only in stock 
we do not have any capital lease obligations  long term purchase obligations  off balance sheet arrangements or any other long term liabilities besides those listed above 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are explained in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical given they involve estimates and judgments made by management and are important for our investors understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
long lived assets our long lived assets include capitalized costs of filing patent applications  capitalized licenses and property and equipment 
see notes  and to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report for more detail regarding our long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
estimates of future cash flows and timing of events for evaluating long lived assets for impairment are based upon management s judgment 
if any of our intangible or long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over its fair value 
the net carrying value of long lived assets at december   subject to possible impairment charges in the future  are presented by location in the following table below vacaville california owensboro kentucky germantown maryland total machinery and equipment land  building and leasehold improvements patents licensees patent technology is also used at the owensboro  kentucky biomanufacturing facility 
all long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  the estimated period that the assets will generate revenue  or the statutory or contractual term in the case of patents and intellectual property licenses 
estimates of useful lives and periods of expected revenue generation are reviewed periodically for appropriateness and are based upon management s judgment 
workforce reductions in connection with our restructuring plans  we accrue for severance payments and other related termination benefits provided to employees in connection with involuntary staff reductions 
we accrue for these benefits in the period when benefits are communicated to the terminated employees 
typically  terminated employees are not required to provide continued service to receive termination benefits 
in general  we use a formula based on the number of years of service to calculate the termination benefits to be provided to affected employees 
at december   million was accrued for future severance benefit payments 
stock based compensation during  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation effective as of 
table of contents january  for its stock based employee compensation plans using the prospective recognition method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas this method applies the recognition provisions of sfas to all employee stock awards granted  modified  or settled after january  and accordingly  recognized compensation expense for those issuances under our stock based employee compensation plans 
methodologies used for calculations such as the black scholes option pricing model and variables such as volatility and expected life are based upon management s judgment 
such methodologies and variables are reviewed and updated periodically for appropriateness and affect the amount of recorded charges 
see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report for more information on the amounts  methodologies and variables related to non cash stock based compensation charges 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
factors that may affect our business risks related to our business we have a history of significant net losses and negative cash flows 
we recently have raised additional working capital 
however  our working capital may not be sufficient to fund all of our product development initiatives 
we have realized significant net losses and negative operating cash flows in recent years and in the year ended december  our working capital balance at december  was million 
on march   we sold additional common stock see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations raising net proceeds after expenses of approximately million 
based upon our current working capital balance  our current rate of negative operating cash flows and the expected cost to complete the development of our products  we cannot assure you that the company will be able to sustain operations without additional working capital 
our recent operating results and our current stock price may limit our ability to issue additional equity securities and existing stockholders could experience significant dilution upon such an issuance 
our revenues for the years ended december  and were not significant 
we may be required to further reduce our operating costs by further restructuring our operations or reducing the scope of our development programs 
these actions may adversely affect our ability to generate new sources of revenue 
we currently lease excess office and laboratory space in germantown  maryland 
we are attempting to sublease our germantown facility for the remainder of the lease term that expires in if we are unable to sublease this excess space  we will not realize all of our planned cost saving for if we are unable to significantly increase our revenues or reduce expenses  we will not be able to achieve profitability or positive operating cash flows  our working capital will continue to erode  and our business will suffer 
we need to continue funding our product development programs 
our aprotinin and alpha galactosidase products require clinical trials to prove their efficacy and safety for pharmaceutical applications 
we do not have sufficient working capital to complete all phases of clinical trials 
if we are unable to raise sufficient equity or collaborative funding  we may delay or abandon some of our product development initiatives  which would likely harm our business 

table of contents we may require additional capital 
we require substantial working capital to continue our product development programs and to fund our operations 
in addition  the risks inherent in developing innovative products  such as aprotinin  alpha galactosidase and the bamf technology based diagnostic tests make it difficult to forecast with certainty the capital required to commercialize our products 
we may raise this capital through public or private equity financings or through collaborations or strategic partnerships 
our access to equity markets may be restricted by depressed stock valuations or other factors 
also  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  existing stockholders may be significantly diluted 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new collaboration or strategic partnership that results in significant working capital or revenue 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
we may not be able to enter into collaborations necessary to fully develop and commercialize our products and technologies  and we will be dependent on our collaborators if we do 
we are independently pursuing some therapeutic product applications into the development stage 
however  we expect to develop and commercialize most of our future products in collaboration with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other companies 
for example  our strategy concerning our aprotinin and alpha galactosidase a involves seeking partners to complete the development of these products 
we cannot assure you that such collaborative arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if our cash flows continue to deteriorate or we take significant steps to reduce our expenses  potential partners may question our ability to perform and choose not to do business with us  which would make it harder for us to find a partner and would harm our ability to commercialize our products 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to enter into future collaborations with other companies for the financing of development and or regulatory approval and commercialization of our products 
our reliance upon these companies for these capabilities will reduce our control over such activities and could make us dependent upon them 
furthermore  obtaining funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to sell or license the rights to certain of our products or technologies on terms that are worse than we might have been able to obtain in a different environment 
to date  we have entered into only a limited number of collaborations 
generally  the scope of these collaborations has been to demonstrate the function of plant genes and the feasibility of using viral vectors to create proteins in plants and to identify marker proteins for drug development and diagnostics 
some of our existing agreements provide us with rights to participate financially in the commercial development of products resulting from the use of our technologies 
we may be unable to obtain such rights in future collaborations 
in addition  unforeseen delays or complications could arise and result in the breach of our contractual obligations with our collaborators and others  or render our technologies unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success 
we may be unable to recruit and retain senior management and other key scientific personnel on whom we are dependent 
the loss of one or more of our senior management or other key scientific personnel could significantly harm our business  cause collaborators to cease doing business with us or potential collaborators to decline to do business with us  and could otherwise inhibit our research and development and commercialization efforts 
none of our key personnel are subject to employment agreements that prevent them from leaving our employment 
we face competition for research scientists and technical staff from other companies  academic institutions  
table of contents government entities  nonprofit laboratories and other organizations 
we have implemented cash salary reductions substituting non cash stock compensation for our highest paid employees to conserve cash 
our compensation practices may be less attractive compared to our competition 
failure to recruit and retain senior management and scientific personnel on acceptable terms may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
future workforce reductions and management restructurings may hurt the performance of our continuing personnel  and make it more difficult to retain the services of key personnel 
we restructured our operations in both and  resulting in substantial workforce reductions 
these reductions affected all functional areas including a change in top management 
future changes and reductions may create concerns in our employee base about job security  our direction or focus  and the continued viability of the company 
such concerns could lower productivity  make it more likely that some of our key employees will seek new employment and require us to hire replacements  and cause concerns among collaborators or potential collaborators about doing business with us 
these factors also may make the management of our business more difficult and make it harder for us to attract employees in the future 
we are at an early or middle stage of product commercialization  and we may not be able to successfully develop our products and technologies nor sustain commercial use of our technology 
we are in an early or middle stage of commercialization  and we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of a business enterprise  including the need for substantial capital to support the development of our products and technologies 
our anticipated products most likely will require that we enter into new collaborations before we can manufacture and or market them 
our nhl vaccine cannot be further developed without collaboration in the foreseeable future 
development of our alpha galactosidase a and aprotinin products without collaboration or partnering are limited in terms of development 
because we are in new and developing fields such as diagnostic tests for disease  and our research focuses on new and unproven products  our therapeutic vaccines  proteins and other therapeutics under development may not be effective for their intended purpose  or may not meet regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy 
in addition  even if we successfully develop a product  there may not be a substantial commercial market for that product at commercially viable prices 
we are in new and developing fields and there may not be a market for our technologies 
our technologies  including our geneware and bamf technology  have limited commercial precedent 
much of our research is fundamentally unique and we cannot assure the acceptance of its scientific merit or the benefits of products produced by it  nor that the public will react favorably to it 
the usefulness of the information and products generated by our proteomics  functional genomics and bioinformatics technologies is unproven  and our collaborators and potential collaborators may determine that they are not useful  cost effective  or otherwise unacceptable to them 
we generate large amounts of data from our research with genes and proteins and we may not be able to mine or integrate this data in a timely manner  or turn it into commercially viable information 
in addition  because our fields are characterized by rapid innovation  we must complete development of our technologies in time to meet market demand  if any 
if we fail to do so  it is likely that other technologies and companies will predominate and we will not be able to earn a sufficient return on our investment 

table of contents alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them non competitive 
genomics  proteomics  biomanufacturing and bioinformatics are intensely competitive fields 
they are characterized by extensive research efforts  which result in rapid technological progress that can render existing technologies obsolete or economically noncompetitive 
if our competitors succeed in developing more effective technologies or render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive  our business will suffer 
many universities  public agencies and established pharmaceutical  biotechnology  health care  chemical and other life sciences companies with substantially greater resources than we have are developing and using technologies and are actively engaging in the development of products similar to or competitive with our products and technologies 
like us  our competitors are using proteomics and genomics technologies to identify potential drug targets  therapeutic proteins and diagnostic marker proteins 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in new technologies and improve existing technologies 
if our revenues and cash flows do not improve significantly  we will not have the resources to continue such investment 
our competitors may devise faster  more complete or more accurate methods to obtain proteomic and functional genomic information than our technologies and systems  including our geneware systems and bamf technology 
there has been and continues to be substantial academic and commercial research effort devoted to the development of such methods 
if successful competitive methods were developed  it would undermine the commercial basis for the products and technologies we intend to provide 
general economic conditions may cause uncertainty with respect to other companies and entities collaborating with us or otherwise dealing with us  and this can have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows 
to a large extent  decisions by businesses and other entities to collaborate or otherwise do business with us are discretionary  and the decision making process typically takes many months to complete 
we believe that the previous slowdown in the us and global economies  and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in particular  has caused potential collaborators and customers to defer decisions to work with us or to access our technologies 
as a result  revenues and cash flows have been uncertain 
future results are difficult to predict  as it is difficult to accurately assess and predict the future demand for our products  technologies and services 
general economic conditions are expected to improve as the economy grows 
however  we cannot assure you that any such improvement will cause our results of operations to improve 
if economic conditions decline or stagnate  our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
conflicts with collaborators or licensees could harm our business 
conflicts with collaborators could have a negative impact on our relationships with them  including on our revenues to be derived from certain of these relationships  and impair our ability to enter into future collaborations  either of which could adversely affect our business 
collaborators could develop competing products  preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors or terminate their agreements with us prematurely 
moreover  disagreements could arise with collaborators or licensees over rights to our intellectual property  our rights to share in any of the future revenues from products or technologies resulting from use of our technologies  our rights to payments for achievement of milestones or our performance of research and development activities on behalf of collaborators  or our activities in separate fields may conflict with other business plans of our collaborators or licensees 

table of contents we must enter into agreements with third parties to provide sales and marketing services  or develop these capabilities on our own  if we are to successfully commercialize our products and technologies 
although we plan to enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms  if at all 
we must also continue to develop a business development force with sufficient technical expertise to generate demand for our products and technologies 
our possible inability to develop business development personnel  or contract for effective sales and marketing capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technologies 
we may not be able to successfully manufacture products in commercial quantities or at acceptable costs 
the failure of our technologies to provide safe  effective  useful or commercially viable approaches to the discovery  development and or production of drug targets and proteins which can be used as therapeutics and diagnostic tests for diseases such as cancer would significantly limit our business plan and future growth 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may enable them to collectively influence significant corporate transactions that require stockholder approval 
our directors  our executive officers and principal stockholders affiliated with our directors and executive officers beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  the concentration of ownership in combination with other common stockholders may collectively influence significant corporate transactions such as mergers  changes in control  consolidation or sale of some or all of our assets  and other significant corporate transactions requiring shareholder approval 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of may  subject to certain specified exceptions and limitations under the rights plan  we will continue to issue one right for each share of common stock that becomes outstanding after may  each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one one hundredth of a share of our series a junior participating preferred stock for per unit 
under certain circumstances  if a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding shares of common stock  holders of the rights other than the person or group causing their exercisability will be able to purchase  in exchange for the exercise price  shares of our common stock or of any company into which we are merged having a value of in addition  the board of directors has the option  under certain circumstances  to exchange each right other than rights held by the person or group triggering the board of directors option for a share of common stock for no additional consideration on the part of the holder of the right 
the rights expire on april  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock by causing substantial dilution of the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to acquire control of us 
our rights plan may have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts because a potential acquirer would have to negotiate with our board of directors to avoid suffering dilution 

table of contents provisions in our charter and bylaws and applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law may also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our common stock or delay  prevent or deter a merger  acquisition  tender offer or proxy contest  which may adversely affect our stock price 
risks related to our industry if companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  healthcare  and life sciences industries do not succeed or their demand for our products and technologies decreases  then our revenues could be reduced 
we expect to derive our revenues primarily from products and technologies provided to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  healthcare and life sciences industries 
accordingly  our success will depend directly on the success of companies in these industries and their demand for our products  services and technologies 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in expenditures by companies in those industries  or their unwillingness or inability to use our products and technologies 
these reductions and delays may result from factors that are not within our control  such as changes in economic conditions generally  the extent to which companies in these industries conduct research and development involving diagnostics  proteomics and functional genomics in house or through industry consortia  the extent to which genomic information is or is not made publicly available  consolidation within one or more of these industries  changes in the regulatory environment affecting these industries  pricing pressures  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and or other factors affecting spending in these industries 
if competitive products are better than our products  then our business may fail 
our human and veterinary therapeutics and vaccines are included in the highly competitive markets for protein development and production 
we face significant competition in our protein product development and production efforts from entities using alternative  and in some cases higher volume and larger scale  approaches for the same purpose 
competitors with substantially greater resources are actively developing products similar to or competitive with our products and potential products 
our competitors may succeed in developing products or obtaining regulatory approval before we do or in developing products that are more effective than those we develop or propose to develop 
a large number of universities and other not for profit institutions  many of which are funded by the us and foreign governments  are also conducting research to discover genes and their functions 
any one or more of these entities may discover and establish a patent position in one or more of the genes or proteins that we wish to commercialize 
several pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and other life sciences companies engage in research and development in the use of unique gene expression systems to produce therapeutic proteins 
these competitors may develop products earlier or obtain regulatory approvals faster 
table of contents than we may be able to  or develop products that are more effective than ours 
new developments are expected to continue  and discoveries by others may render our products and technologies noncompetitive  which could lead to the failure of our business 
diagnostics companies in the health care industry with more resources than us constitute varied competition for our diagnostic technology  which is early stage 
competing diagnostic technologies may be developed and marketed that may be competitively superior to ours 
our collaborators and we may not obtain fda and other approvals for our products in a timely manner  or at all 
drugs and certain diagnostic products and tests are subject to an extensive and uncertain regulatory approval process by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries 
the regulation of new products and certain diagnostic products and tests is extensive  and the required process of laboratory testing and human studies is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the burden of these regulations will fall on us to the extent we are developing proprietary products 
we may not be able to obtain the clearances and approvals necessary for the clinical testing  field testing  manufacturing or marketing of our products 
if the products or diagnostic tests are the result of a collaborative effort  these burdens may fall on our collaborators or we may share these burdens with them 
we may not obtain fda or other approvals for those products or tests in a timely manner  or at all 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
even if we obtain fda regulatory approvals  the fda extensively regulates manufacturing  labeling  marketing  promotion and advertising after product approval 
further  once a manufacturer obtains regulatory approval  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  test or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  test  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product or test from the market 
in some countries  regulatory agencies also set or approve the sale prices for drug and diagnostic products and tests 
additionally  several of our product development areas may involve relatively new technology that has not been the subject of extensive product testing in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these products and diagnostic and tests and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products and tests themselves may be subject to substantial review by the fda and foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval 
regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test  manufacture and commercialize our products and tests 
usda rules could adversely affect us or our collaborators 
we must comply with usda regulations for outdoor releases of genetically engineered organisms as well as other products designed for use on or with agricultural products 
in addition  the usda prohibits growing and transporting genetically modified plants except pursuant to an exemption or under special permits 
we may use genetically modified plants as screening or production hosts 
changes in usda policy regarding the movement or field release of genetically modified plant hosts could adversely affect our business by increasing the cost of our products and technologies or decreasing consumer demand for those products and technologies or causing the government to prohibit their sale or use 
if we fail to comply with such rules or policies  we may be subject to financial loss or be liable for costs incurred as a result of non compliance 

table of contents if there is negative public reaction to the use of genetically engineered products and technologies  then the market for certain products and technologies we develop will be adversely affected 
future commercial success of some of our products and of the products of some of our collaborators will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products including drugs  plants and plant products 
claims that genetically engineered products are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment may influence public attitudes 
negative public reaction to genetically modified organisms and products could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and resultant products  including stricter labeling requirements  and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  even if such products do not result from gmo organisms 
we may be sued for product liability and our product liability insurance may not be adequate 
the testing  marketing and sale of our and our collaborators products and diagnostic tests will entail a risk of allegations of product liability  and third parties may assert substantial product liability claims against us 
while we have limited product liability insurance to protect against this risk  adequate insurance coverage may not be available at an acceptable cost  if at all  in the future and a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of the products and diagnostic tests developed by our collaborators or us 
if we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our products or our collaborators products  our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability 
if we use hazardous materials in our business in a manner that causes injury or violates laws  we may be liable for substantial damages 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
the chemicals we use include  but are not limited to  flammable solvents such as methanol and ethanol  ethidium dye which is a commonly used fluorescent dye for visualizing dna  and buffer solutions used in the purification of dna  and various organic solvents  acids and bases 
we also use several radioisotopes including phosphorous  carbon  sulfur  phosphorous  iodine and hydrogen we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages and criminal penalties in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
further  it is possible that the materials we use could contaminate another party s property 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability 
in addition  compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research and development and production efforts 
although we have general liability insurance  these policies do not cover claims arising from pollution from chemical  radioactive or biological materials 
our collaborators may also be working with various types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  any hazardous materials 

table of contents healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit the financial returns from our products and diagnostic tests 
our ability and that of our collaborators to commercialize therapeutics and diagnostic products and tests may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will pay the cost of these products and tests 
these third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new medical products  tests and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics and diagnostics  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for any product to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
risks related to our intellectual property patent protection in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical  and healthcare industries is uncertain  which may result in a decrease in the value of our products and technologies 
we are involved in overlapping and rapidly evolving areas of biotechnology  pharmaceutical development  healthcare  and diagnostics and basic research involving viral vectors  plant transgenics  proteomics  functional genomics  protein transformation  and immunotherapy 
each of these areas has been the subject of intense research and patenting activity throughout the world by our commercial competitors  actual and potential collaborators  academic institutions and government researchers 
we cannot determine whether or not there are patents currently pending that  if issued  would prevent us from practicing our core technologies  commercializing them or developing commercially viable products and diagnostic tests based upon them 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that will determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize products and technologies similar to our products and technologies without any compensation to us 
our potential collaborators or customers may conclude that uncertainties about patent protection decrease the value of our databases  products and services 
throughout the world there are numerous issued patents  as well as published foreign patent applications which may be issued as patents  many of which relate to our current operations  our anticipated future operations and the products we are likely to develop 
the scope of these patents is a matter of legal interpretation and is subject to uncertainty 
we have not obtained  but we may in the future obtain  opinions from our patent counsel that we have freedom to conduct our commercial activities free of claims of patent infringement from third parties 
from time to time  we receive letters from third parties that allege patent infringement on our part 
disagreements arising from these letters could result in costly and time consuming litigation and divert our financial and managerial resources 
in addition  if we are ever determined to infringe the patent of any third party  we may be required to obtain a license to use this patent  which would increase our cost of doing business 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents that are enforceable 
our disclosures in our patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability in all cases 
as a result  we do not know which of our patent applications will result in enforceable patents 
our patent applications may not be issued as patents  and any patents that are issued to us may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
any issued patent may not provide us with competitive 
table of contents advantages 
others may challenge our patents or independently develop similar products that could result in an interference proceeding in the us patent and trademark office 
others may be able to design around our issued patents or develop products similar to our products 
in addition  others may discover uses for genes or proteins other than those uses covered in our patents  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
public disclosure and patents relating to genes and gene sequences and diagnostic products and tests held by others may limit our proprietary rights 
the human genome project and many companies and institutions have identified genes and deposited those sequences in public databases and are continuing to do so 
these public disclosures might limit the scope of our claims or make unpatentable subsequent patent applications on full length gene sequences 
we are aware of issued patents and patent applications containing subject matter such that we or our licensees or collaborators may require a license or rights in order to research  develop or commercialize some of our products  diagnostic tests and technologies 
we may find that licenses relating to such subject matter will not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
patent infringement or enforcement litigation or interference proceedings could be costly and disrupt our business and may prevent us from commercializing our products and diagnostic tests 
the technology that we use to develop our products  diagnostic tests and key resources  and those that we incorporate in our products  diagnostic tests and technologies  may be subject to claims by third parties  including our collaborators  that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
technologies of our collaborators may also be subject to infringement or similar claims which could impair our collaborative product and diagnostic test development and commercialization efforts 
we also may need to enforce our patent rights in actions against others  which could be expensive 
the risk of such events occurring will tend to increase as the fields of proteomics  genomics  health care and the biotechnology industry expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and proteins and engage in other proteomics  genomics  diagnostics and biotechnology related businesses 
with respect to identifying proteins uniquely associated with disease states or as targets for drug therapy  we are aware that companies have published patent applications relating to nucleic acids encoding specific proteins 
we are also aware of issued and pending patent applications covering certain aspects of bioinformatic based diagnostic testing 
the issued patents by the us patent and trademark office to these companies  may limit our ability and the ability of our collaborators to practice under any patents that may be issued to us 
also  even if the us patent and trademark office issues us a patent  the scope of coverage or protection afforded to the patent may be limited 
we may not be able to protect our know how and trade secrets 
we generally control the disclosure and use of our know how and trade secrets using confidentiality agreements 
it is possible  however  that some or all confidentiality agreements will not be honored  third parties will independently develop equivalent technology  disputes might arise with our consultants  collaborators or others concerning the ownership of intellectual property  and or unauthorized disclosure of our know how or trade secrets will occur
