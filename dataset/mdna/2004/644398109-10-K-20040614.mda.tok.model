readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to our ability to retain our major customers that account for and of our total revenue  our ability to compete effectively for quality content with our pay tv group s primary competitor who has significantly greater resources than us  our ability to compete effectively with our pay tv group s major competitor or any other competitors that may distribute adult content to cable msos  dbs providers  or to the hotel industry  our ability to retain our key executives  our ability to successfully manage our credit card chargeback and credit percentages in order to maintain our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment for our products and services  and our ability to attract market support for our stock 
the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
our business our goal is to be the leading provider in the electronic distribution of high quality adult entertainment via cable  satellite and broadband platforms 
as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment  we use the following core competencies o leveraging our technical infrastructure we own and operate a broadcast origination facility where our licensed content is a ingested at one central point and converted into multiple digital formats that allow for broadcast  vod and internet delivery  b tagged with meta data that allows for efficient cataloging of the elements included in the movie  c edited into the proper formats required by our customers ie  most edited  partially edited  and least edited  and d subjected to several rigorous quality control reviews prior to airing on our ppv or vod services or the internet 
by owning and operating our own technical infrastructure  including our proprietary media asset management software tool  we are able to quickly respond to new revenue opportunities with zero to very little capital outlay 
for example over the years  we have worked closely with many cable msos in understanding and perfecting the delivery of vod content  allowing us to become the leader in the delivery of vod content in the adult category 
we have been able to easily capitalize on new opportunities for delivering our content to the hotel industry due to our technical infrastructure 
we responded to the demand for new partially edited ppv services by launching two new networks in only days at very little additional cost 
we believe that our technical infrastructure will allow us to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities in the cable  satellite  and broadband areas as well as any new platforms that may be discovered 
o content library we license content from a network of over different adult studios  allowing us access to a wider variety of directors  actors and actresses  and content niches than our primary competitor 
we are committed to providing our consumers with variety  breadth and depth of content in order to appeal to the widest audience base possible 
we understand that our content is purchased in an impulse environment and in order to capture those purchases we must provide a large amount of content to the consumer 
therefore  we have licensed what we believe to be the largest digital library of adult content in the world that we use to program our ppv networks  vod service and internet website 
content is used continuously through the life of the license term and will be repurposed in many ways  including using clips of the content and creating compilations or blocks of programming from several movies 
we spend approximately million annually licensing content for our ppv networks  vod service and internet website 
the amount spent annually on licensing content has been the same for three years 
o expertise in aggregation of adult content we consider ourselves to be experts in the aggregation of high quality adult content 
we ensure that we have all proper documentation required to verify that the cast members of the movies that we license are eighteen years or older 
we monitor the trends in the video sales and rental market to understand what content niches are popular and program our networks to correspond to these trends 
we monitor the trends of the vod buys of our own content to understand what type of content is selling the best and adjust our programming models for these trends 
we strive to provide the best performing ppv networks and vod service to the cable dbs hotel markets 
we program seven ppv networks in order to accommodate different editing standards and different programming niches to best serve our customers needs 
we also ensure that the interstitial programming that we create is entertaining  edgy  and appeals to our consumer audience 
we operate our company in two different segments pay tv and internet 
our core business resides within the pay tv segment and this is where the majority of our financial and human resources are concentrated 
pay tv segment our pay tv segment is focused on the distribution of its seven ppv networks and its video on demand vod service to cable msos and dbs providers 
in addition  the pay tv group has had success in delivering its vod service to hotel rooms through its current distribution arrangement with on command 
the pay tv group earns a percentage of revenue on each pay per view  subscription  or vod transaction related to its services 
revenue growth occurs as the pay tv group launches its services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experiences growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where its services are currently distributed on line growth  launches additional services to its existing cable dbs partners  experiences new and on line growth for its vod service  is able to effect increases in the retail price of its products  and is able to increase the buy rates for its products 
the pay tv group seeks to achieve distribution for at least four of its services on every digital platform in the us based on the current market of million dbs households and million digital cable households  the pay tv group currently has of its defined market share 
revenue growth for the pay tv group for the year ended march  was driven primarily by o growth in revenue from its vod service provided to the cable and hotel industries o growing acceptance for its partially edited services revenue from the pay tv group s vod service became a significant part of its overall revenue mix representing of total pay tv revenue during the fiscal year ended march   as cable operators upgraded their systems to deliver content in this manner 
the pay tv group currently delivers its vod content to million cable network households as compared to million a year ago  as well as to  hotel rooms through its distribution arrangement with on command 
the company expects cable operators will continue to upgrade their systems to allow for the delivery of vod content to the home 
vod can only be delivered in a digital  cable environment 
currently  per the ncta  there are million digital cable households in the us we estimate that million digital cable households are vod enabled and  of this amount  million provide adult content to their vod customers 
we anticipate that by the end of calendar year over of digital cable households will be vod enabled 
we expect that our vod cable revenue will increase as msos continue the deployment of this technology to their digital cable subscribers and as they increase the amount of space allocated on their vod servers to the adult category currently we provide hours of programming each month 
today  we are the sole provider of adult vod content to the two largest us cable msos 
however  we can give no assurances that we will continue to remain the exclusive provider of adult vod content to these two cable msos 
the pay tv group s relationship with on command generated incremental vod revenue for the year ended march  however  we do not expect significant revenue growth in fiscal year from the hospitality industry 
future revenue growth from vod revenue generated through the hospitality industry is dependent upon the addition of new hotel properties by on command  an increase in business traveler occupancy rates  and our ability to distribute our vod content through other providers of in room entertainment to the hospitality industry 
in addition to the growth in vod  the pay tv group experienced a growing acceptance for its partially edited services during the fiscal year 
the pay tv group launched two new partially edited services in january to respond to this change 
accordingly  we are seeing a shift in our distribution away from our most edited service pleasure as more cable operators choose to launch our partially edited services ten  ten clips  ten blue and ten blox 
to date  the focus of the pay tv group has been on the distribution of its ppv and vod services to cable  dbs and hotel platforms in the us market only 
the pay tv group also provides its two least edited services to the c band market on a direct to the consumer basis 
c band customers contact the pay tv group s in house call center directly to purchase the networks on a one month  three month or six month subscription basis or ppv basis 
the pay tv group retains of the revenue from these customers and over of the sales are made via credit cards 
this market has been declining for several years as these consumers convert from c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller  inch digital dbs satellite systems 
the pay tv group has been able to decrease its transponder  uplinking and call center costs related to this business over the years in order to maintain its margins 
however  based on the rate of revenue decline and the expected erosion of its c band margins  the pay tv group expects that it will no longer be operating this business by the end of its fiscal year 
the pay tv group expects continued declines in revenue from this segment of its business during looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that could impact the pay tv group s future financial results including the following o increased competition from other adult companies attempting to provide vod content and ppv services to cable providers or dbs platforms o increased regulation of the adult industry o loss of exclusivity on the vod platform of certain cable operators we believe that many opportunities accompany these challenges and risks 
among these opportunities  we believe the following exist for the pay tv group o upcoming ppv and vod launches with our newest cable affiliates o obtaining distribution for our ppv services with directv o continued growth in the vod segment from further deployment of this technology by the largest cable operator in the us o implementation of technologies that will allow for distribution of our content on new platforms o future international distribution opportunities internet segment the internet group generates revenue by selling monthly memberships to its website  ten 
com  by earning a percentage of revenue from third party gatekeepers like on command for the distribution of ten 
com to their customer base  and by selling pre packaged video and photo content to webmasters for a monthly fee 
in fiscal years and  the internet group also generated revenue by selling traffic from its sites that did not convert into a member to other webmasters 
due to the decline in the volume of traffic to ten 
com  we no longer generate revenue from selling non converting traffic to other webmasters 
during the and fiscal years  we significantly restructured our internet business 
the decision to restructure our internet business was based on a number of factors including the large number of adult websites competing for web surfers  the lack of barriers to entry into the adult internet business  the increased regulation from visa and mastercard  and the amount of free adult content available on the internet 
through this restructuring we moved the internet group from los angeles  california to boulder  colorado  decreased staffing levels from approximately employees to seven  decreased the number of websites we were creating and managing from thirty to one  discontinued the practice of purchasing large amounts of traffic  and focused the business on creating a premiere broadband website branded as ten 
com 
in addition  in connection with a legal settlement  the internet group transferred approximately of its primary domain names to a third party as of april  the transfer of these domain names resulted in a significant  although expected  decline in traffic volume to ten 
com 
once the restructuring was completed  we shifted our focus to forming long term revenue sharing partnerships with third party gatekeepers  such as cable companies  hospitality providers and portals for the distribution of ten 
com  whereby we could gain direct access to consumers in search of adult entertainment 
we completed one such agreement with on command for the distribution of ten 
com through their digitally wired hotel rooms  and we expect to create additional revenue sharing arrangements in the near term with select cable operators 
the success we achieve with these cable operators will dictate the revenue potential for this segment in the longer term and will serve as justification for larger mso s to adopt this business model 
currently we do not generate any meaningful revenue from these third party arrangements less than of total internet revenue 
over of revenue from the internet group continues to be generated from monthly memberships to ten 
com 
however  we have seen this revenue erode over the past several years since the current traffic volume to ten 
com does not generate enough new monthly sign ups to offset the churn of our renewing membership base 
the decline in membership revenue has slowed over the past several quarters as new marketing efforts have increased traffic to ten 
com  generating monthly sign ups that are close to or slightly exceeding our monthly cancellation rate 
we will be focusing on other ways to generate profitable traffic during the fiscal year in order to reverse the decline in membership revenue from ten 
com 
we have also seen a decrease in revenue generated from selling pre packaged content to webmasters 
this decrease in revenue from the sale of content is due to a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
in addition  we have not allocated any significant resources towards a sales effort for these content products during the fiscal year 
we expect to contract with a third party during the fiscal year to sell our products to the webmaster community 
we view our internet group as an investment in the future  and we do not anticipate any significant revenue growth from this segment during the fiscal year 
as broadband distribution grows  and as technology improves the delivery of content through wireless applications such as cell phones and personal digital assistants pdas  the internet group will be the segment through which we will capitalize on these potential revenue generating opportunities 
until then  the internet group will focus its efforts on deriving monthly subscription revenue from traffic directed to ten 
com through advertising on the pay tv group s networks and affiliate webmaster programs  as well as to completing new revenue sharing partnerships through which we can gain access to captive adult consumers of the cable msos 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  goodwill impairment  and prepaid distribution rights content licensing 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed with our audit committee the development  selection  and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues for the pay tv group are primarily related to the sale of our ppv and vod services to cable dbs and hotel affiliates 
the cable affiliates do not report actual monthly ppv or vod sales for each of their systems to the pay tv group until days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the pay tv group s historical experience for each affiliated system 
the pay tv group subsequently adjusts its revenue to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the cash 
historically  any differences between the amounts estimated and the actual amounts received have been immaterial due to the overall predictability of pay per view revenues 
since vod is such a new service  the revenue expected from new vod cable affiliates can be more difficult to predict 
the pay tv group believes that it is conservative in estimating the impact of the rollout of vod households  and it continually adjusts estimates to reflect actual revenue remitted 
the recognition of revenues for both the pay tv and internet groups is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
we have currently recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
should we determine that a reduction in the valuation allowance is appropriate  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a reserve for chargebacks and credits for estimated refunds related to customers whose transactions were processed via credit cards for both the pay tv and internet groups 
should our actual chargebacks and credits be higher than estimated we would have an additional expense for the period in which this was experienced 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method 
through the end of fiscal year  the company amortized its goodwill over years using the straight line method 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles fas  that was effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal year  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
the company completed the initial impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal year and concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting unit the pay tv group exceeded its respective carrying value as of june  and  therefore  no impairment existed at that date 
in addition to the initial impairment test completed during the first quarter of fiscal year  we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment process compares the fair value of the pay tv group to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the pay tv group 
we concluded for the and fiscal years that the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charge was required 
if actual operating results or cash flows are different than our estimates and assumptions  we could be required to record impairment charges in future periods 
prepaid distribution rights content licensing our pay tv group s film and content library consists of newly produced and historical film licensing agreements 
we account for the licenses in accordance with fas financial accounting by broadcasters 
accordingly  we capitalize the costs associated with the licenses and certain editing costs and amortize the costs on a straight line basis over the life of the licensing agreement usually to years 
pursuant to fas the costs associated with the license agreements should be amortized based on the relative revenues earned for each usage of the film 
we have determined that it is appropriate to amortize these costs on a straight line basis under the assertion that each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenues 
we regularly review and evaluate the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis and assess if an accelerated method would more appropriately reflect the revenue generation of the content 
through our analysis  we have concluded that the current policy of recognizing the costs incurred to license the film library on a straight line basis most accurately reflects the revenue generated by each showing of the film 
we periodically review our film library and assess if the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the films 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  we will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value of the film library to the fair market value 
results of operations pay tv group formerly  called subscription pay per view tv group the following table outlines the current distribution environment and networks households for each network and our vod service estimated network households in thousands as of as of as of march  march  march  network distribution method pleasure cable    ten cable dbs    ten clips cable dbs    video on demand cable    ten xtsy c band cable dbs    ten blueplus c band cable n a ten max c band cable ten blue cable  n a ten blox cable  n a total network households    note n a indicates that network was not launched at that time ten xtsy  ten blueplus and ten max addressable household numbers include million  million  and million c band addressable households for the years ended march    and respectively 
the pay tv group discontinued providing its ten blueplus network in february the above table reflects network household distribution 
a household will be counted more than once if the home has access to more than one of the pay tv group s services  since each service represents an incremental revenue stream 
the pay tv group estimates its unique household distribution as of march  to be million cable homes and million dbs homes 
the following table sets forth certain financial information for the pay tv group for the three years ended march in millions twelve months ended march percent change vs vs net revenue cable dbs hotel c band total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income net revenue cable dbs hotel revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s cable dbs hotel revenues from to was attributable to the following items o a increase in vod revenue o the addition of vod revenue from the hospitality industry o a increase in revenues generated by our three services on the dish platform o an increase in cable revenue from our partially edited services the above items are described in more detail below 
revenue from our vod service became a significant contributor to the pay tv group s revenue mix during the fiscal year as cable operators have aggressively upgraded their plants to deliver content in this manner to their customers 
our vod content is available through our distribution arrangements with cable msos to million cable network households  up from million households a year ago  representing an increase of 
additionally  we are currently the sole provider of adult vod content to the two largest cable msos in the us during the fiscal year  we also began delivering our vod content to  hotel rooms through our distribution arrangement with on command 
through this agreement we deliver up to fourteen titles on a monthly basis to on command for use on their in room entertainment platform which they provide to the hospitality industry 
our vod revenue from both cable households and the hospitality industry via our arrangement with on command accounted for and of total cable dbs hotel revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
revenue from our ten  ten clips and ten xtsy networks on the dish platform increased year over year 
this increase was due to an overall increase in ppv buys for each service while the number of monthly subscribers to each service increased 
we believe that these increases in buys and subscribers can be attributed to the increase in overall subscribers to the dish platform 
as discussed above  the pay tv group has seen a growing acceptance by its consumer base for its partially edited services  ten  ten blue  ten blox  and ten clips 
we view this as a positive development given the higher buy rates and higher retail rates associated with this editing standard 
in anticipation of the increased acceptance for partially edited programming  we launched two new networks in january these two new services  ten blue and ten blox  plus our legacy partially edited services  ten and ten clips  are now distributed to million network households as compared to million network households a year ago  representing a increase 
revenue from these four networks increased from to cable dbs hotel revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s cable dbs hotel revenues from to was attributable to the following items o an increase in revenue generated by ten xtsy on the dish platform o an increase in revenue generated by ten clips as a result of an increase in distribution for this network from to o an increase in our vod revenue from to the following items offset the increase in revenue from the above items o a decrease in revenue from our pleasure network due to disaffiliations by directv and dish o a decrease in ten revenue generated on the dish platform the above items are described in more detail below 
in january  dish launched ten xtsy on its satellite at degrees 
in august  dish moved ten xtsy to its satellite at degrees 
significantly more addressable subscribers view dish s satellite at degrees than its satellite at degrees 
in addition to the satellite change  in september dish increased its retail price for ten xtsy to for a ppv purchase and for a monthly subscription from and  respectively 
together  these changes resulted in an increase in revenue generated by the ten xtsy network on the dish platform from to ten clips was available to million and million network households as of march  and  respectively  representing a increase in distribution year over year 
dish also increased its retail prices for ten clips in september to for a ppv purchase and for a monthly subscription from and  respectively 
revenue from ten clips increased from to as a result of an increase in distribution and the increase in retail prices on the dish platform 
we experienced significant growth in revenue from our vod service  ten on demand  between and as this technology was rolled out for the first time by several cable msos 
revenue from our vod service accounted for of total cable dbs hotel revenue for the year ended march   as compared to for the year ended march  during the fiscal year  both dish and directv terminated distribution of our pleasure network 
both dbs providers terminated distribution of pleasure to create available bandwidth for the addition of partially edited services to their platforms 
the loss of this distribution resulted in a decrease in revenue from the pleasure network from to however  this decrease was offset by an increase in revenue from new launches and online growth for our pleasure network with several cable msos 
revenue from our ten network declined from to because of a decrease in the number of monthly dish subscribers 
this decline in the number of monthly subscribers has been ongoing since dish converted ten to a ppv service in in addition  ppv buys from ten on the dish platform declined from to due to the addition of a competing network of the same editing standard to the dish platform in september c band revenue the year over year decreases in c band revenue are due to the continued decline of the c band market as consumers convert c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller  inch digital dbs satellite systems 
the total c band market declined from to and from to although the c band market has continued to decline  our c band revenue declined at a slower rate due to the fact that our only competitor on this platform went out of business during the fiscal year 
providing service to the c band market continues to be profitable for us  generating operating margins of approximately during the fiscal year 
we will continue to closely monitor this business and when margins erode to an unacceptable level we will discontinue providing our content on this platform 
we anticipate that we will no longer be providing our networks on the c band platform by the end of the fiscal year 
in an effort to minimize costs associated with this revenue stream  we discontinued selling ten blueplus on the c band platform during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast facility  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisition and conforming costs  vod transport costs  amortization of content licenses  and c band call center costs 
the increase in cost of sales from fiscal year to is due to a a increase in costs associated with our digital broadcast center and b the addition of vod transport costs during the fiscal year 
the increase in costs related to our digital broadcast facility is due to the hiring of additional personnel to manage our growing vod business 
we began paying transport costs to tvn for the services they provide in delivering our vod content to cable msos during the fiscal year 
these fees are expected to increase during the fiscal year as our vod business continues to grow 
the increase in our cost of sales from to was offset by a decrease in c band call center costs and a decrease in transponder costs for this same period 
the pay tv group successfully renegotiated its lease costs for its analog transponders during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we discontinued one of our c band services allowing us to terminate the lease for one of our analog transponders 
the increase in cost of sales from fiscal year to is due to a a increase in the amortization of the pay tv group s content licenses and b a increase in costs associated with the digital broadcast center related to new functionalities and redundancies added during the fiscal year 
these increases were offset by a decrease in transponder lease costs and a decrease in c band call center costs 
the pay tv group successfully renegotiated its lease cost for its four analog transponders at the end of its fiscal year 
operating income operating income increased from to largely as a result of a increase in revenue year over year 
gross margins increased from to year over year and operating expenses declined during the same period 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year from for the fiscal year 
the decrease in operating expenses from to is primarily related to a decrease in c band marketing costs during the fiscal year 
at the end of the first quarter of its fiscal year  the pay tv group discontinued using its barker channel to market its c band services 
the decrease in operating costs associated with the barker channel was offset by an increase in sales commissions and costs associated with the pay tv group s in house promotions department 
sales commissions increased during the fiscal year due to an increase in distribution for our ppv and vod services 
costs associated with operating our in house promotions department increased during the fiscal year as we hired more personnel to produce and edit the promotional and branding elements of our ppv and vod programming 
the increase in operating income from to is primarily related to a decrease in operating expenses during this period 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined from to during this same period 
the decline in operating expenses from to was related to a decline in a the costs associated with the group s c band barker channel  b advertising costs  c payroll costs associated with the elimination of two senior manager positions  and d commissions paid to the group s sales force as a result of a change in the commission plan and a decline in the number of people being commissioned 
in addition  due to an accounting pronouncement change  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer required to be amortized and are  instead  tested for impairment on an annual basis using the guidance for measuring impairment as set forth in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill amortization was  and  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively

we ceased actively purchasing traffic for our web sites during the fiscal year ended march  instead  we depended upon our adult domain names and the advertising of ten 
com on the pay tv group s networks to generate type in traffic for ten 
com 
in addition  we transferred domain names to a third party in settlement of a lawsuit at the end of the fiscal year 
the loss of these urls resulted in an expected decline in the volume of traffic to ten 
com during the fiscal year such that the number of new monthly sign ups was not enough to offset the monthly cancellation rate 
the decrease in revenue from the sale of content during the past three fiscal years is a result of a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
in addition  we did not allocate any significant resources towards a sales effort for our content products during the fiscal year 
revenue from the sale of traffic was earned by forwarding exit traffic and traffic from selected vanity domains to affiliated webmaster marketing programs domestically  monetizing foreign traffic via international dialer companies  marketing affiliated webmaster sites through our double opt in email list  and by directing traffic to our pay per click ppc search engine  www 
sexfiles 
com 
due to the decline in traffic volume to ten 
com during the and fiscal years  our sale of traffic revenue decreased from to and was completely eliminated during the fiscal year 
in addition  we ceased the use of our opt in email list and ppc search engines at the end of the fiscal year as a means to generate revenue from the sale of traffic 
our other revenue was earned from the sale of services such as hosting  co location and bandwidth management isp services to non affiliated companies 
during the fiscal year ended march   we ceased selling our isp services to outside customers and focused our data center operations solely on our internal needs 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of variable expenses associated with credit card fees  bandwidth costs  traffic acquisition costs purchase of traffic  web site content costs and depreciation of assets 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of sales from to is related to a decline in depreciation expense and bandwidth costs 
these costs declined due to the data center restructuring completed during the fiscal year see data center restructuring below through which we wrote off excess equipment  moved the data center to boulder  colorado  and negotiated more favorable bandwidth rates 
in addition  we eliminated the costs associated with our ppc search engine and email program at the end of fiscal year 
variable costs related to the processing of credit cards for membership revenue also declined from to in tandem with the decrease in this revenue stream 
the decrease in costs of sales from to is related to a decline in traffic acquisition costs 
traffic acquisition costs declined from to because we ceased actively purchasing traffic for our sites during the fiscal year 
in addition  depreciation expense declined due to the restructuring completed during the fiscal year through which we wrote off excess equipment 
variable costs related to the processing of credit cards for membership revenue also declined from to as this revenue stream declined year over year 
operating income loss operating income increased from to primarily due to the fact that cost of sales and operating expenses declined by million year over year while revenue for the same period declined by only million 
the decline in operating expenses from to is related to decreases in payroll  benefits and other office expenses for all of our departments as a result of the final restructuring completed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year see internet restructuring below 
this restructuring resulted in a decrease in sales  marketing  data center  and web development personnel 
operating income decreased from to primarily due to the fact that the decrease in revenue year over year was only partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales and operating expenses for the same period 
the decrease in operating expenses from to was related to a the elimination of our in house customer service and credit card processing functions  b a decrease in payroll  benefits  and facility costs related to the restructuring and relocation of the sales  marketing  engineering and web development departments to boulder  colorado  c a decrease in trade show related costs  and d a decrease in travel related costs

asset impairment we recognized impairment losses on certain domain names owned by our internet group of million during the fiscal year ended march  management identified certain conditions  including a declining gross margin due to the availability of free adult content on the internet and decreased traffic to the internet group s domain names  as indicators of asset impairment 
these conditions led to operating results and forecasted future results that were substantially less than had been anticipated at the time of our acquisition of the internet group 
we revised our projections and determined that the projected results would not fully support the future amortization of the domain names associated with the internet group 
in accordance with the company s policy  management assessed the recoverability of the domain names using a cash flow projection based on the remaining amortization period of two to four years 
based on this projection  the cumulative cash flow over the remaining amortization periods was insufficient to fully recover the intangible asset balance 
corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for corporate administration expenses for the three years ended march in millions twelve months ended march percent change vs vs operating expenses expenses related to corporate administration include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the pay tv and internet operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq and the sec  investor relation cost  and printing costs associated with the company s public filings 
the decrease in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to an decrease in legal fees 
legal fees decreased from due to the settlement of a lawsuit with three former officers of our company during the last quarter of our fiscal year 
in addition  we also saw a decrease in our postage  printing and public relation expenses 
these expenses were higher in the fiscal year due to the proxy fight that the company was involved in that year 
consulting costs also declined from  as we were no longer using an outside corporate advisory firm 
the decline in these costs was offset by an increase in our accounting and auditing costs and an increase in fees paid to our outside board members for the fiscal year 
the increase in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to a lawsuit that we filed against three former officers of our company these lawsuits were settled by the end of the fiscal year and no additional costs were incurred going forward  a increase in general insurance and directors and officers insurance premiums  the addition of fees paid to our outside board members  and a increase in expenses related to the proxy fight that the company defended itself against public relations  printing and postage costs 
the increase in these expenses was offset by a decrease in payroll and benefit costs due to the elimination of several senior management positions and a decrease in travel costs 
we estimate that approximately million of our corporate administration expenses related to the proxy fight and our lawsuit with our former officers 
deferred taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion will not be realized 
the company routinely evaluates its recorded deferred tax assets to determine whether it is still more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
during the years ended march  and  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized and we  accordingly  recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
if we generate future taxable income against which these attributes may be applied  some portion of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods 
however  during the fiscal year  options and warrants were exercised and certain disqualified dispositions occurred resulting in deductions for tax purposes of approximately million 
as the million valuation allowance for these tax assets is reversed it will be credited to additional paid in capital instead of net income

purchases of equipment and furniture for the fiscal year related primarily to purchases of software licenses  minor equipment upgrades to the pay tv group s digital broadcast facility and the purchase of encrypting equipment for new cable launches  while the purchases completed during the fiscal year were primarily related to the internet group s data center facility in los angeles 
we currently estimate that purchases of equipment and furniture during the fiscal year will be less than million  which will include approximately million to complete the improvements we are making to our digital broadcast facility 
purchases of investments represented the next most significant investing activity during the fiscal year 
these purchases related to certificates of deposits in which we invested during the year 
financing activities our cash flows provided by used in financing activities are as follows in millions year ended march  cash flows provided by used in financing activities payments on capital lease obligations decrease notes payable stock options warrants exercised retirement of stock issuance of redeemable preferred stock redemption of redeemable preferred stock other net cash provided by used in financing activities during the fiscal year we issued million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay million of the company s notes payable 
an additional million in debt was converted to million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock 
during the fiscal year  we issued million shares of class b redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem million of the company s class a redeemable preferred stock and to fund the purchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of new frontier media  inc common stock from edward bonn  a former officer of the company 
during the fiscal year  we redeemed million of the class a and class b redeemable preferred stock 
in addition  during the fiscal year million of the class b redeemable preferred stock was converted into a note payable which was then subsequently repaid 
much of our cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was offset by the exercise of stock options and warrants which generated cash from financing activities of million 
in may  we repaid our secured note payable in the amount of million 
ongoing interest expense for our remaining capital lease obligations and debt is anticipated to be immaterial 
if we were to lose our major customers that account for and of our revenue  our ability to finance our future operating requirements would be severely impaired 
the company did not incur any federal income taxes for the year ended march   due to certain prior year restructuring charges and impairments being deductible in the current year  deductions resulting from the exercise of warrants and options  and the availability of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
certain state taxes were unable to be offset by these deductions 
we expect that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss carryovers from this and prior years to offset most of our taxable income for the fiscal year 
however  we do expect to pay some federal and state taxes during the fiscal year 
we currently estimate the cash required for these taxes to be less than million 
we believe that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements  and we believe that any capital expenditures that may be incurred can be financed through our cash flows from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is principally confined to cash in the bank  money market accounts  and notes payable  which have short maturities and  therefore  minimal and immaterial market risk 
interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had cash in checking and money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these assets 
furthermore  the company s borrowings are at fixed interest rates  limiting the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not have any foreign currency exposure because it currently does not transact business in foreign currencies
