item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by advantage bank 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions of marietta savings  first savings  first bank for savings  germantown federal  westwood homestead and columbia savings and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offered 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth by integrating its residential lending function through establishing mortgage banking operations in the bank s primary market areas and  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s divisions have the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent divisions from its competition 
management believes that the bank divisions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s net earnings have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the terms anticipates  plans  expects  believes  and similar expressions as they relate to camco or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
camco s actual results  performance or achievements may materially differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such material differences include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the financial services industry  changes in law  governmental policies and regulations  and rapidly changing technology affecting financial services 
critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco financial s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing assets and goodwill impairment 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to us 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the bank s trends in delinquencies and loan losses  as well as trends in delinquencies and losses for the region and nationally  and economic factors 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
while the corporation strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
mortgage servicing assets to determine the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  management transmits information to a third party provider  representing individual loan information in each pooling period accompanied by escrow amounts 
the third party then evaluates the possible impairment of msrs 
this process is described below 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology to the servicing valuation  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each grouping of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for float  which is supplied by management  takes into consideration the investment portfolio average yield as well as current short duration investment yields 
management believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by the third party provider utilizing the economic outlook as published by the office of chief economist of the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac in estimating prepayment speeds and provides a specific scenario with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earning figures approximate the cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  management reviews the information and the mortgage servicing asset is marked to lower of amortized cost or market for the current quarter 
goodwill we have developed procedures to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis using june financial data 
this testing procedure is outsourced to a third party that evaluates possible impairment based on the following the test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
the value is determined assuming a freely negotiated transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
accordingly  to derive the fair value of the reporting unit  the following common approaches to valuing business combination transactions involving financial institutions are utilized by a third party selected by camco the comparable transactions approach specifically based on earnings  book  assets and deposit premium multiples received in recent sales of comparable thrift franchises  and the discounted cash flow approach 
the application of the valuation techniques takes into account the reporting unit s operating history  the current market environment and future prospects 
as of the most recent period  the only reporting unit carrying goodwill is the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no second step is required 
if not  a second test is required to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the second test of the overall goodwill impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the impairment loss shall equal the excess of carrying value over fair value 
after each testing period  the third party compiles a summary of the test that is then provided to the audit committee for review 
summary management believes the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuations of mortgage servicing assets and the goodwill impairment test are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed camco s disclosures relating to them in this annual report 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled billion  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of a decrease in investment securities and mortgage backed securities  which were partially offset by an increase in loans receivable 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
investment securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  investment securities purchases were comprised of million of intermediate term fhlb and fnma bonds  all were callable  with an average yield of 
such purchases were offset by maturities of million and sales of million during the year 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  mortgage backed securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million and sales totaled million during the year ended december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were comprised primarily of balloon and ten year amortizing us government agency securities yielding  which were classified as available for sale 
loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over the total at december  the increase resulted primarily from loan disbursements and purchases totaling million  which were substantially offset by loan sales of million and principal repayments of million 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  during exceeded volume by million  or  which was primarily attributable to an increase in refinancing activity following the decreases in the overall level of long term interest rates during the two year period ended december  during  camco continued to experience a high rate of loan refinance activity as the interest rate environment remained at almost unprecedented lows 
however  as came to a close  our production levels had decreased approximately from mid year we anticipate current levels of production to continue into the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans days or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million at both december  and  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
at december   nonperforming loans were comprised of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million of loans secured by multi family  nonresidential real estate and commercial loans and  of consumer and other loans 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
the decrease resulted primarily from management s decision not to aggressively bid on certificates of deposit which matured during  to manage interest rate risk in the current low interest rate environment 
while management has generally pursued a strategy of moderate growth in the deposit portfolio  advantage has not historically engaged in sporadic increases or decreases in interest rates offered  nor has it offered the highest interest rates available in its market areas 
advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb decreased by million  or  to a total of million at december  in the fourth quarter management restructured million of fhlb borrowings having an average term of months and an average fixed rate of  replacing them with variable rate advances having a weighted average rate of approximately at december  the prepayment fee incurred was  on an after tax basis  but management believes that the positive net earnings impact in could approach  or 
per share  as a result of the reduced borrowing cost 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   a million  or  decrease from december  the decrease resulted primarily from purchases of treasury shares totaling million  dividends of million and a million decrease in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which were partially offset by net earnings of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
the increase in treasury shares represented purchases under the stock repurchase plan that was announced in october the bank is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations 
during  management was notified by its supervisory regulators that advantage was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
at december   the bank s regulatory capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net earnings for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of net earnings reported in the decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to a million decrease in net interest income  a one time charge of million in pre tax expense associated with the restructuring of a portion of the bank s fhlb borrowings  an increase in the provision for losses on loans of  and an  increase in general  administrative and other expense  which were partially offset by an increase of million in other income and a million decrease in the provision for federal income taxes 
net interest income 
total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of a decrease of basis points in the average yield  from in to in  and a million  or  decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding and a basis point decrease in the average yield  to in interest income on mortgage backed securities totaled million for the year ended december   a million  or  decrease from the period 
the decrease was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average yield  to in  which was partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance outstanding 
interest income on investment securities decreased by  or  due primarily to a basis point decline in the average yield  to in  which was partially offset by a million increase in the average balance outstanding year to year 
interest income on other interest earning assets decreased by  or  due primarily to a decrease in the yield of basis points  to in  and a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year 
interest expense on deposits totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits  to for  and a million  or  decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits outstanding year to year 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average rate  to in  partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance outstanding year to year 
decreases in the level of average yields on interest earning assets and average cost of interest bearing liabilities were due primarily to the overall decrease in interest rates in the economy during and as a result of the foregoing changes in interest income and interest expense  net interest income decreased by million  or  to a total of million for the year ended december  the interest rate spread decreased to approximately at december   from at december   while the net interest margin decreased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the period 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the bank s loan portfolio 
based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the provision recorded in the provision was predicated primarily on the overall increase in the loan portfolio  including the increased percentage of loans secured by commercial real estate within the loan portfolio and an increase in the level of loan charge offs year to year 
for  we believe the provision will continue to grow as we anticipate changing our loan mix by increasing the percentage of commercial loans and consumer loans to total loans 
management believes all nonperforming loans are adequately collateralized  however  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb losses on known nonperforming assets or that the allowance will be adequate to cover losses on nonperforming assets in the future 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in other income was primarily attributable to an  increase in gain on sale of investment and mortgage backed securities  an increase of  or  in title fees  a combined increase of  in gains on sale of premises and equipment and real estate acquired through foreclosure  and an overall increase of  or  in mortgage banking related income  partially offset by a  or  decrease in late charges  rent and other income 
the increase in title fees was due primarily to an increase in production related to the low interest rate environment 
the increase in mortgage banking income was comprised of an  or  increase in gain on sale of loans  a  or  increase in loan servicing fees and a net decrease in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights of  or 
the increase in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to an increase in the volume of loans sold of million  or  over the volume of loans sold in during  the bank recorded mortgage servicing rights on new loan sales totaling million and amortization of mortgage servicing rights totaling million  which resulted in a net income item of  during  the bank recorded mortgage servicing rights on new loan sales totaling million  amortization of mortgage servicing rights totaling million and recapture of an impairment charge of  all of which resulted in a net income item of million 
due to an anticipated drop in fixed rate residential one to four family loan production  we expect a reduction in mortgage banking income in general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due primarily to the million fee associated with the restructuring of a portion of the bank s fhlb borrowings and an increase of  or  in employee compensation and benefits  a  or increase in franchise taxes  a  or  increase in occupancy and equipment and the absence of  related to the reversal of the restructuring charge recognized in the increase in employee compensation and benefits was due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation and health insurance costs  as well as normal merit increases  which were partially offset by an increase in deferred loan origination costs related to the increase in lending volume year to year 
the increase in franchise tax expense reflects the effects of refund claims recorded in the increase in occupancy and equipment was due primarily to an increase in office repairs and maintenance expenses  as well as costs associated with the new dover office location

general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in general  administrative and other expense was due primarily to an increase of million  or  in employee compensation and benefits  a  or  increase in occupancy and equipment  and an increase of  or  in other operating expense  which were partially offset by the effects of a nonrecurring restructuring charge totaling  recorded in and the  restructuring credit recognized in  as well as a  or decrease in franchise taxes  a  or  decrease in data processing and a  decrease in goodwill amortization 
the increase in employee compensation and benefits was due primarily to the acquisition of the columbia division  an increase in management staffing levels  an increase in incentive compensation and other benefit plan costs and normal merit compensation increases  which were partially offset by an increase in deferred loan origination costs related to the increase in lending volume year to year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of the bank s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the bank s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the bank s balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and achieving consistent growth in core deposits 
management considers interest rate risk the bank s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the bank s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
to identify and manage its interest rate risk the bank employs an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes senior management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the bank 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the bank s current interest rate risk position is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point bp instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 
given the current federal funds rate of at december   a linear bp decrease was modeled in the estimated earnings sensitivity profile in place of the linear bp decrease in accordance with the bank s interest rate risk policy 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of net interest income for a month horizon 
the following table shows the bank s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in percentage change in interest rates net interest income basis points months given a bp linear increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated net interest income for the bank would increase by over one year 
a bp linear decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
management does not expect any significant adverse effect on net interest income in based on the composition of the portfolio and anticipated upward trends in rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the bank has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or federal national mortgage association fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
a total of million and million of such loans were sold to the fhlmc  fnma and other parties during and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources camco  like other financial institutions  is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
liquid assets consist of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  investments and mortgage backed securities 
management monitors and assesses liquidity needs daily in order to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract as of december  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank      certificates of deposit     amount of commitments expiration per period commitments to originate loans overdraft lines of credit home equity commercial lines of credit   one to four family and multi family loans   non residential real estate and land loans   total contractual obligations      advantage bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
based upon historical deposit flow data  the bank s competitive pricing in its market and management s experience  management believes that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with the bank 
the bank engages in off balance sheet credit related activities that could require advantage to make cash payments in the event that specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts of these activities represent the maximum exposure to the bank 
however  certain off balance sheet commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  therefore  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these off balance sheet activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of the bank s customers 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of advantage s management strategy 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  brokered deposits  and through the sales of loans and or securities
