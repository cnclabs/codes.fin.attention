overview the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussions under application of critical accounting policies  which describes key estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our financial statements and additional factors that may affect our business  future operating results  and financial condition which describes key risks associated with our operations and industry 
teletouch is a leading provider of wireless telecommunications services  primarily paging services  in non major metropolitan areas and communities in the southeast united states 
as of may   the company had approximately  pagers in service 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed  periodic fees without incurring additional selling expenses or other fixed costs

index to financial statements results of operations for the fiscal years ended may   and total revenue changes in teletouch s total revenue are shown in the table below twelve months ended may  twelve months ended may  change change service  rent and maintenance revenue product sales revenue gross revenue service  rent and maintenance revenue service  rent and maintenance revenues declined due to losses in paging and messaging revenues of million in fiscal year from fiscal year and million in fiscal year from fiscal year this resulted from fewer pagers in service and lower demand for one way paging 
pagers in service decreased to approximately  at may  as compared to  and  at may  and may   respectively  due to a continuing decline in the demand for one way paging service 
as discussed earlier  demand for one way paging services has declined over the past several years and teletouch anticipates that it will continue to decline for the foreseeable future  which will result in reductions in service  rent and maintenance revenues due to the lower volume of subscribers 
teletouch continues to strive to develop new products and services that could partially offset the loss in paging subscribers and the related recurring revenues 
to date  the revenues generated by the company s new telemetry products have offset only an insignificant portion of the decline in paging revenues 
the company continues to be able to generate sufficient cash to operate the business as a result of certain cost saving measures it has implemented over the past several years 
if revenues from its new telemetry products do not increase significantly during the first half of fiscal  the company will have to consider restructuring its operations to reduce expenses further to help offset some of the continuing paging revenue deterioration in order to ensure sufficient cash to operate the business during the coming year 
if additional funds are needed to operate the business in fiscal beyond cash flows from operations  the company has an additional million available under a lending arrangement with tll partners  a company controlled by robert mcmurrey  chairman of the board of teletouch as well as a revolving line of credit with first community financial corporation with borrowings available up to million based primarily on the company s eligible accounts receivable 
the company will be implementing certain programs during fiscal in an attempt to stabilize its current paging subscriber base and reduce the cost of supporting these customers 
some areas of focus include more aggressive customer retention efforts  pricing strategies to combat the increasingly competitive paging market and locating strategic paging carrier partners to share in the relatively fixed network costs of the paging infrastructure 
product sales revenue the decline in product sales revenues was due primarily to the company s exit from the retail business in november which resulted in a decline in cellular revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and million for fiscal as compared to fiscal compounding the decline in product sales revenue was a decline in pager equipment sales of million for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulting from the decrease in demand for these devices 
the decline in product sales revenue was partially offset by an increase in two way equipment sales revenue of million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the two way equipment sales revenue increase is attributable to the purchase of the assets and customer base of delta communications  inc  in the third quarter of fiscal year  which enabled teletouch to expand its coverage to the dallas fort worth area as well as certain sales contracts achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal that were the result of the release of federal grant monies under the homeland security programs which allow city  county and local emergency response entities to upgrade their communications equipment 
total costs and expenses the comparability of operating  selling and general and administrative expenses is affected by the inclusion of certain restructuring costs relating to the company s closing of retail stores 
total costs and expenses  as listed below  are presented excluding restructuring costs of million and million  included in operating expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations  for fiscal years and respectively

in addition  third party airtime expense declined million from fiscal year over fiscal year due to better rates negotiated by the company combined with lower use as a result of the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base

in addition  third party airtime expense declined million due to better rates negotiated by the company combined with lower use as a result of the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base 
in may  the company completed a review of the financial performance of its retail stores 
this review resulted in the decision to close of the company s locations 
provisions for estimated losses on the abandonment of certain leased retail space were  and the loss recorded on the abandonment of related leasehold improvement costs was  as of may  and these charges were included in the operating expense of the company during fiscal after completing the retail exit plan discussed in item restructuring activities and during the quarter ending february   the company increased its provision for losses for certain changes in estimates related to the company s retail exit plan including  for personnel related costs and  for lease obligations 
quarter end november  charges related to the company s retail exit plan included  for the abandonment of certain leased retail space   for the abandonment of related leasehold improvements   for personnel related costs and  for write downs on excess furniture and fixtures and computer equipment held for sale 
such charges have been included in operating expenses in the company s consolidated statement of operations

as paging subscribers and the related recurring revenues continue to decline  operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue will continue to increase unless the company is able to generate sufficient revenue growth in its other product and service offerings or it restructures its operations again to reduce its operational costs 
future restructuring of the company s operations will be difficult as the personnel and facilities costs have been reduced to a level that the company s management believes that further reductions in these areas may have a greater negative impact on revenues due to a potential impairment in teletouch s ability to service its existing customers 
although no restructuring plans have been formalized by the company it is currently evaluating the profitability of each of its paging systems throughout the southeast united states 
if the revenues on a system were to decline to the point that the system were unprofitable  the company would be forced to shut that system down and forfeit the revenues associated unless it were able to convert those customers to another compatible system 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the declines in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal years and are due primarily to a write off  in fiscal year  of certain paging infrastructure equipment of million  write downs on excess furniture  fixtures and computer equipment held for sale of million  and charges to write off leasehold improvements relating to store closings of million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements loss on disposal of assets the increase in loss on disposal of assets is due primarily to the write off of million of computer software programs in the third quarter of fiscal the company purchased the computer software  in fiscal  which was represented to be a fully integrated system 
after a year of implementation  it was determined that the software was not capable of handling the complexities of a telecommunications company 
the company is currently proceeding with a potential legal claims it may have against the vendor 
write off of equipment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed verification procedures of its property  plant and equipment 
as a result of the procedures performed  certain paging infrastructure equipment was not identified 
the company believes that a significant amount of the equipment not identified was attributable to ongoing significant repair and upgrades of its network performed on its paging infrastructure over the seven years prior to this verification without always accurately accounting for the replacement or removal of capitalizable infrastructure equipment 
during these prior periods  the removal of certain equipment during the maintenance process was not recorded 
due to the seven year time period over which this activity likely took place it was impractical for the company to accurately attribute this loss to the period in which it occurred  therefore  the company recorded a charge of approximately  during the second quarter of fiscal to write off the remaining carrying value of this equipment 
the company believes that the amount of the loss attributable to any prior year is not significant to any prior annual operating results or financial position 
interest expense net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal years and from million in fiscal the decline in interest expense in fiscal years and as compared to fiscal year  is directly attributable to the company s successful restructuring of the senior and junior subordinated debt on may  which resulted in the company extinguishing approximately million in unpaid principal and accrued interest in exchange for approximately million in cash and the delivery of a new promissory note in the amount of million and certain other securities 
income taxes the effective tax rate is for the twelve months ended may   due partially to the interest expense related to the redeemable common stock warrants being non deductible for tax purposes and due to a change in the tax accrual estimates made at may  the company s net operating loss carryforwards were reduced to at may  from approximately million at may  other deferred tax assets were reduced as well 
this reduction occurred in accordance with the attribute reduction rules of internal revenue code section related to the company s debt restructuring 
a corresponding reduction to the valuation allowance previously recorded against these assets was also recorded and the valuation allowance as of may  was financial condition teletouch s cash balance was  at may  as compared to  at may  cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations during fiscal years and was primarily due to the continued decline in paging and messaging service revenue 
in addition during fiscal year  the company made payments of  related to fiscal year federal income taxes and  for fiscal year estimated federal income taxes 
the decrease in cash provided by operations is partially offset by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the completion of the retail exit plan in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year was 
table of contents 
index to financial statements primarily due to the company ceasing interest payments on the credit agreement in june during the continued negotiations with the lenders to reorganize this senior debt instrument 
the company was successful in restructuring its senior debt in may by paying its senior lenders an aggregate cash amount of approximately  and delivering a new promissory note to one of the original senior lenders in the amount of  discussed below under senior debt reorganization 
additionally  pursuant to the restructuring agreement dated may  by and among tll partners  gm holdings and teletouch  the two holders of the company s junior subordinate notes reached an agreement that released and discharged teletouch of its junior debt obligations without recourse 
gm holdings forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  including accrued interest and tll partners forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  if the revenues from the company s new telemetry product initiatives materialize during the first half of fiscal  the company expects that cash flow provided from operations  together with the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs in fiscal otherwise  the company may have to eliminate certain costs from its operations to meet its cash requirements during fiscal teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase pagers for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s existing subscribers 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  amounted to million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal was due to less capital spending on opening new retail stores as well as the declining number of paging subscribers requiring leased pager equipment 
teletouch anticipates that capital expenditures will decline in fiscal as the company plans to only replace necessary equipment to maintain the paging infrastructure while continuing to purchase an adequate supply of pagers to lease to its declining customer base 
teletouch expects to pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations 
under the company s credit agreement with first community financial corporation  the company has available borrowings of up to million which is dependent on the company s borrowing base primarily consisting of accounts receivable at any point in time 
based on the eligible accounts receivable as of may   the company s allowable borrowings under this agreement were million 
under this credit facility  million was funded as of may  under the company s credit agreement with tll partners  the company has available borrowings of up to million 
under this credit facility  million was funded as of may  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company was unable to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants under the fcfc loan agreement but these covenants were waived by fcfc to allow the company to remain in good standing for this period 
the fcfc loan agreement is a revolving line of credit that the company has utilized to bridge the timing of the receipt of customer payments with its operating cash outflows 
effective february   the company negotiated an extension of its loan agreement with fcfc through may  which included modifications to certain of the financial covenants included in the agreement 
these modifications made it easier for the company to comply with the financial covenants during fiscal if the company is unable to develop additional revenues from its new telemetry products in fiscal  the company anticipates it will be difficult to comply with these financial covenants without additional restructuring 
if this loan facility were to be unavailable  the company could experience temporary cash shortages during the year that could cause payments to vendors to be delayed 
the company was in compliance with its financial covenants at may

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  teletouch evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets  reserves for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition and certain accrued liabilities 
teletouch bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets teletouch evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets and certain intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets 
as a result of the closure of the company s retail stores in fiscal  the company identified excess furniture and fixtures and computer equipment used previously in its retail business  classified these excess assets as assets held for sale and recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated recoverable value less any anticipated disposition costs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of these assets now classified as assets held for sale from million to million by recording a charge of million to restructuring expense 
at may   all such assets held for sale had been disposed of by the company 

table of contents 
index to financial statements teletouch s review of the carrying value of its long lived assets at may  indicates that the carrying value of these assets is recoverable through future estimated cash flows 
if the cash flow estimates  or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based  change in the future  teletouch may be required to record additional impairment charges related to its long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historic collection experience  current trends and a percentage of the accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining these percentages teletouch reviews historical write offs  including comparisons of write offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues  teletouch compares the ratio of the allowance for doubtful accounts to gross receivables to historic levels and teletouch monitors collections amounts and statistics 
teletouch s allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of may  while write offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same write off rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the allowance for doubtful accounts and related provisions for write offs 
reserve for inventory obsolescence estimates are used in determining the reserve for inventory obsolescence and are based on sales trends  a ratio of inventory to revenue  and a review of specific categories of inventory 
in establishing its reserve  teletouch reviews historic inventory obsolescence experience including comparisons of previous write offs to provision for inventory obsolescence and the inventory count compared to recent sales trends 
teletouch s reserve for inventory obsolescence was million as of may  prior to fiscal  inventory obsolescence has been within our expectations and the provision established 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional reserves for inventory obsolescence to recognize the deterioration in the market value of certain pager  cellular and electronics and telemetry inventory 
pager inventory was impaired primarily due to a decline in market value of certain damaged pagers that are repaired by the company 
cellular and electronic inventory became impaired after many months of attempting to sell off this excess equipment and the company recorded a reserve equaling the total value of this inventory 
certain telemetry inventory  primarily related to the company s fixed monitoring product line  was impaired subsequent to the company exiting this business line 
teletouch management cannot guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same obsolescence rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for inventory obsolescence and the related inventory write offs 
revenue recognition teletouch s revenue consists primarily of monthly service and lease revenues charged to customers on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
deferred revenue represents prepaid monthly service fees paid by customers 
revenue also includes sales of messaging devices and other products directly to customers and resellers 
teletouch recognizes revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
teletouch believes  relative to sales of one way messaging equipment  that all of these conditions are met  therefore  product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue from sales of other products is recognized upon delivery
