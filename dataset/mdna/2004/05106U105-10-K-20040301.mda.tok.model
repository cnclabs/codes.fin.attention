item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and with the cautionary statements section included elsewhere in this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
overview since our founding in  we have become recognized as a world class provider of automated defect detection and product characterization systems for microelectronic device manufacturers 
our systems provide manufacturers with information that enables process enhancing decisions  ultimately lowering manufacturing costs  improving time to market and enhancing the performance of their products 
we combine our core competencies in machine vision technology  optics  lighting and precision motion control with our proprietary software and extensive microelectronic specific applications experience to deliver scalable  modular systems that excel at the automated detection of advanced macro defects  which we define to be defects greater in size than micron 
we sell our systems to many of the leading microelectronic device manufacturers throughout the world for inspecting semiconductors  advanced packaging applications  optoelectronics devices  mems  data storage devices and micro displays 
we have traditionally provided systems to address the automated inspection needs of the early stages of the final manufacturing or back end of the microelectronic device manufacturing process 
these needs were met primarily with our nsx series and di series of products 
we recently introduced the axi series and exi series systems for advanced macro detection in the front end of the wafer manufacturing process 
when used in conjunction with the b back side inspection option these systems allow a manufacturer to inspect the top  edge and back of a wafer s surface 
we believe we will be the first to offer all surface wafer inspection 
we complement this broad inspection capability with an expanding suite of software tools designed to enhance the speed and effectiveness of the process by which device manufacturers analyze defects  and make decisions regarding their manufacturing process to reduce or eliminate such defects 
we refer to this process as the detection to decision process 
in addition to internal development  we look to expand through strategic acquisitions of complementary products and technologies 
in april we completed the acquisition of sti  adding the wav series for high speed wafer probe mark inspection and metrology 
in july we acquired the assets of csi  including the design for a recently introduced defect review system for advanced microscope based imaging and analysis 
the versascope provides us the ability to serve our customers earlier in their device development process and to more quickly analyze defects and understand their manufacturing process once they initiate high volume production 
our business is subject to the cyclical nature of the microelectronic device manufacturing markets we serve 
these cycles are caused by significant fluctuations in the supply and demand of microelectronic devices driven by such factors as changes in technology and global economic conditions 
as a result of these fluctuations  our quarterly orders and sales have fluctuated dramatically 
we anticipate that future quarterly and annual results will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in supply and demand of microelectronic devices  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the pricing of our products and the timing and level of our research and development expenditures 
during the second quarter of  in response to an industry downturn  we began to implement components of a series of cost management programs 
the programs included  at various times  raw material cost reductions  reductions in temporary and contract staffs  work force reductions  mandatory time off  decreases in discretionary spending and reductions in executive compensation and overtime 
although we continued to maintain various components of our cost management programs during and  these savings were offset by our decision to invest in developing our worldwide sales and service organization and in the continued development of new and existing products to better serve our customers and maintain our technology leadership 
during the second half of we began to experience signs of an industry recovery 
this has resulted in a significant increase in the level of orders and sales during this period  and resulted in a record level of backlog of million at december  although management does not believe backlog is always a meaningful or accurate indication of future revenues and performance  since only a portion of our revenues for any quarter represents systems in backlog  we do closely monitor the level of orders both geographically and by product line and in relation to the level of revenues  referred to as the book to bill ratio 
during both and our book to bill ratio was a book to bill ratio greater than indicates a growing level of backlog 
in response to the current increase in activity we have added and continue to recruit additional staff in all functional areas and increased our manufacturing levels to meet the increased demand 
however  we cannot predict the sustainability of a recovery  if any  and or the industry s rate of growth in such a recovery 
if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production capacity during an industry upturn  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to monitoring our level of orders and backlog  we focus on several key financial metrics in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  most importantly revenues by product family compared to prior period revenue performance and current year plans  revenues generated by products introduced in the last two years  year over year revenue growth compared to the overall semiconductor equipment industry  operating profit or loss performance compared with prior period and current year plans and the level of operating cash flow 
we anticipate that future quarterly and annual results will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in supply and demand of microelectronic devices  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the pricing of our products and the timing and level of our research and development expenditures 
results of operations the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating loss interest income other expense loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in net revenues was primarily the result of higher sales of new models within the nsx series which were introduced in the middle of and revenues from the axi series  which was introduced in the first quarter of although the axi series initially shipped in the first quarter of  we did not begin to recognize revenue until the second half of revenues in from the nsx series and axi series were million and million  of total revenues  respectively  as compared to million and none  respectively  in overall  revenues from products introduced in the last two years increased to million  or  in as compared to million  or  in revenues also increased due to sales of products acquired in the sti and csi acquisitions 
the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from the di series 
net revenues derived from international sales represented and of total net revenues in and  respectively 
international net revenues were primarily the result of sales to taiwan and the rest of asia  which comprised and of total net revenues in and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to of net revenues in as compared to of net revenues in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to i a higher level of write offs of obsolete and excess inventory  ii an increase in the number of nsx series systems that included subsystem options manufactured by third parties  which have lower gross margins than our core inspection systems  and iii lower margins on the axi series systems sold under our joint development program with a leading device manufacturer 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues in the expense dollars in increased due to higher variable costs  such as sales commissions and variable employee compensation costs associated with the increased level of revenues  recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring new employees  costs associated with the ongoing operations and amortization of purchased technology from the sti and csi acquisitions  and costs associated with an increase in the number of systems being evaluated by customers 
the increase was partially offset by the fact that the prior year included the write off of costs related to potential acquisitions  the modification of our distributor agreement with metron technology b 
v and higher employee severance costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense dollars to increase in future quarters  primarily as a result of variable expenses associated with the expected higher level of revenues and higher recruiting  relocation and compensation costs related to the hiring of additional employees 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to decrease  as revenues are expected to increase at a higher rate than the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the expense dollars increased primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense related to assets and software capitalized subsequent to the beginning of  employee salaries and related benefits associated with the employees of sti and csi and higher travel costs related to visiting customer locations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the use of outside services and contractors in the development of new and existing products 
we believe our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace 
to do this  we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts 
our investments in new technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher productivity through cost effective  leading edge technology solutions 
as a result  we anticipate that research and development expense dollars will increase in future quarters due to ongoing development projects 
however  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to decrease  as revenues are expected to increase at a higher rate than the increase in research and development expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in interest income was due to lower rates of return earned on investment balances in as compared to and lower average investment balances in we expect interest income to increase in due to an increase in overall investment balances  as a result of the proceeds received from the follow on public offering of our common stock that was completed on september  and the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option on october  the offering 
income taxes 
there was no benefit for income taxes in compared to a provision for income taxes of  or an effective tax rate of  in the provision for income taxes in  rather than a benefit from income taxes related to the pretax loss  is due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  in the second quarter of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result of our taxable earnings history and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets at december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of lower nsx revenues  partially offset by revenues from our di series  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of the decrease in nsx revenues was due to the continued downturn in the microelectronic industries 
net revenues derived from international sales represented and of net revenues in and respectively 
international net revenues were primarily the result of sales to asia  which comprised and of net revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in the number of systems manufactured  which resulted in lower manufacturing utilization and increased labor and overhead costs per system manufactured  and was also impacted by sales of models within the di series that had lower margins than our other products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues in the expense dollars in primarily increased due to the write off of costs related to potential acquisitions  the modification of our distributor agreement with metron technology b 
v  to focus metron s activities entirely on south korea  and employee severance costs 
the increase was offset by the fact that the prior year included costs related to the modification of our distributor agreement with metron  as a result of our decision to sell directly to customers in taiwan  and employee severance costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the increase was primarily due to i our focus on advancing the development of new and existing products in each of our product lines  which led to the hiring of additional engineers and the use of additional outside contractors  ii depreciation and amortization expense related to assets and software capitalized subsequent to the beginning of  and iii travel costs related to visiting customer locations 
these increases were partially offset by various components of the cost cutting program 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased  to  in from million in the decrease is due to lower overall investment balances in  due to the use of cash to fund operations and acquire property and equipment  and lower rates of return earned on investment balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a benefit of  or an effective tax rate of  in the provision for income taxes in is due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  in the second quarter of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result of our taxable earnings history and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets at december  the high effective income tax rate in  compared to the federal statutory rate of plus state and local taxes  was primarily due to the impact of federal and state general business and extraterritorial income credits and tax exempt interest income that could not be utilized until future years due to our net loss 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  working capital increased primarily due to an increase in cash and marketable securities due to the sale of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in the offering 
in conjunction with the offering  on october   the underwriters exercised their option to acquire an additional  shares of common stock to cover over allotments 
the net proceeds received from the offering  after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses  were million 
in  we also generated cash from operating activities of million compared with a net use of cash in operating activities of million during at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and our revolving credit line  which expires in april the credit line agreement allows for borrowings of up to million subject to availability based on accounts receivable and inventory balances 
we have no outstanding debt at december  accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased million to million in  from million in  representing days sales outstanding dso during this compares to a dso of days in the decrease in accounts receivable dso was primarily due to the timely collection of our accounts receivable in due to the high mix of international revenues during a given quarter  which generally require a longer time for collection  we believe our dso could increase in future quarters 
inventories 
inventories increased million to million in  from million in  primarily due to i an increase in inventory at customer sites under purchase orders and as demonstration  ii an increase in raw material  work in process and finished goods inventory to support new product introductions and increased backlog  and iii inventory acquired with sti 
the increase in inventory at customer sites under purchase orders is primarily related to shipments of our nsx series and axi series 
we anticipate that a portion of the inventory at customer sites will be recognized as revenue during the first quarter of we expect inventory at customer sites under purchase orders and demonstration will increase as shipments of newly introduced products increase 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures were  in and our total capital expenditures are expected to be between and million in capital expenditures consist primarily of the capitalization of finished goods used to support our engineering  sales and service efforts and enhancing our enterprise resource planning system 
acquisitions 
as a result of the acquisition of sti  we entered into a two year lease for  square feet of space in plano  texas at an annual rental cost of  as a result of the acquisition of csi  we entered into a lease for  square feet in thornwood  new york at a monthly rental cost of  the lease may be terminated at any time with a six month notice 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business  the most significant of which includes the timing of the collection of receivables  the level of inventories  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our liquidity is also affected by factors beyond our control related to the uncertainties of global economies and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and microelectronic industries 
although liquidity requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of all of these factors and others  management believes that existing cash and investment balances along with our line of credit will be adequate to satisfy our existing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our future cash payments due under contractual obligations as of december  operating leases purchase obligations total in thousands total cash flows 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from the decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the increase in inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million  due to million of net purchases of marketable securities  million paid to acquire sti and csi and  of additions to property and equipment and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million of net proceeds received from the offering and underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by non cash charges  decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  due to million of net proceeds from the redemption and purchases of securities  partially offset by million of additions to property and equipment and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million from the proceeds of issuances of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased inventories  prepaid and other current assets and decreased accounts payable  partially offset by decreased accounts receivable and an increase in customer deposits 
net cash used in investing activities was  due to million of additions to property and equipment and other assets  partially offset by million of net proceeds from the redemption and purchases of securities held to maturity 
net cash provided by financing activities was  from the proceeds of issuances of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and or requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled cautionary statements 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the sale of systems  spare parts  software and services 
system sales we require customers  excluding our distributors  that have new inspection applications to complete pre shipment authorization testing of purchased systems at our facility  prior to shipment 
during this testing  the customer verifies that the system meets their specifications and authorizes shipment 
for systems that have completed pre shipment authorization testing  revenue is recognized as follows revenue from systems that have been demonstrated to meet customer specifications during pre shipment authorization testing is recognized when the product has shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from systems that have not been demonstrated to meet customer specifications during pre shipment authorization testing is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  installation has occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when a customer with a new inspection application declines pre shipment authorization testing of a purchased system  revenue is deferred until  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  installation has occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when the customer has already accepted previous systems with the same specifications  for the same application  we do not require pre shipment authorization testing 
revenue is recognized when the product has shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
system sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  we allocate the revenue to each element based on their relative fair value or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognize the associated revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
spare parts revenue spare parts revenue is recognized when the parts have been shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
software revenue software revenue is recognized ratably over the support period 
service revenue service revenue is recognized after the services are performed and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
service revenues were insignificant during the years ended december   and valuation of accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
for the three years ended december   we have had accounts receivable write offs totaling  which included the write off of one receivable totaling  changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
changes in these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of inventory 
we review inventory for obsolescence and excess quantities to determine that items deemed obsolete or excess are appropriately reserved 
in making the determination  we consider the quantity of inventory at the balance sheet date assessed against each part s historical and future usage rates 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
for the three years ended december   we have written off inventory totaling  we have an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory of  at december   which represents our estimate of obsolete and excess inventory 
changes in factors such as technology  customer demand  competitor product introductions and other matters could affect the level of obsolete and excess inventory in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of tax items for tax and accounting 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
during the second quarter of we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our consolidated financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
impact of accounting standards in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
the consolidation requirements of fin are effective for the first reporting period ending after december  for entities considered to be special purpose entities 
the consolidation requirements for all other entities subject to fin are effective for our consolidated financial statements of the first reporting period ending after march  we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  we will apply the consolidation requirements of fin in future periods should an interest in a variable interest entity be acquired 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments 
sfas became effective for us in july the adoption of sfas did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstance three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statements certain statements contained in this form k and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
as such  they are considered forward looking statements which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events 
such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may  could  possible  plan  project  should  will  forecast and similar words or expressions 
our forward looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies  financial results  product development and sales efforts 
one must carefully consider forward looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions  including  among others  those discussed below 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this subject in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  especially on forms k  q and k if any  in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
as such  investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 
the microelectronic industries that we serve are highly cyclical  causing significant variability in our results of operations 
we primarily serve microelectronic industries and our business depends heavily upon capital expenditures by manufacturers in these industries 
microelectronic industries are highly cyclical  with periods of capacity shortage and periods of excess capacity  this is historically due to sudden changes in demand for microelectronic devices 
in periods of excess capacity  there are often drastic changes in the timing and quantity of capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology or capacity needs by our customers  including sharp cuts in purchases of capital equipment  including our products  by customers 
the timing  length and volatility of these periods are difficult to predict  resulting in pressure on our revenues  gross margin and net income 
in addition to affecting our customers  downturns also challenge our suppliers  vendors  other partners  as well as our management  sales  engineering  manufacturing  customer service and other employees  who are vital to our success 
during downturns in microelectronic industries  customers typically reduce or delay purchases  and or delay delivery or cancel orders 
as a result  it is imperative that we maintain an organization able to quickly and effectively align with market conditions  including bringing our cost structures in line with current industry and overall market conditions 
at the same time  it is imperative that we meet the following objectives continue to serve our existing customers  provide new and improved solutions for new and existing customers  operate effectively with our suppliers and motivate and retain key employees 
if we are  for any reason  unable to achieve any one or more of the above objectives in an efficient  effective and timely manner  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  any delays or reductions in future purchases of capital equipment or delays or cancellations of current orders by microelectronic device manufacturers  for any reason  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection equipment 
we primarily target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection and metrology 
if for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection equipment fails to grow in the long term as we expect  we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and return to our historical growth in the long term 
growth in this market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology 
there is no assurance that manufacturers will undertake this replacement at the rate we expect 
our sales and operating results can fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could adversely affect sales or operating results  or lead to significant variability in our operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our revenue in any particular quarter has historically come from the sale of a relatively small number of systems  the loss of any sale could have a significant negative impact 
a variety of factors could cause this variability  including the following order cancellations or delays in orders by customers  the long sales cycle of our products  decreases in capital spending by our customers  new product introductions by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  entrance into  or additional resources focused on  our markets by larger competitors  component shortages resulting in manufacturing delays  and delays in the development  introduction and manufacture of our products 
we cannot predict the impact of these and other factors on our revenues and operating results in any future period 
results of operations in any period  therefore  should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
because of this difficulty in predicting future performance  our operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
global economic and political environments are important to economic conditions  and long term continued risk or concerns regarding economic and political circumstances could decrease customer demand for our products 
future political or related events similar or comparable to the september  terrorist attacks  significant military conflicts  or long term reactions of governments and society to such events  may significantly affect the willingness or ability of our customers to visit our facilities or trade shows  review our systems capabilities and or purchase or take delivery of our products  as well as our abilities to visit our customers  to perform application studies for our customers  to sell and deliver solutions and to service those solutions 
any decline in the willingness or ability of our customers to travel and visit our facilities  or in our ability to travel and visit our customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  such events could have an adverse effect on the economy generally  and microelectronic industries in particular  causing our customers to reduce or delay capital equipment purchases 
the market acceptance of our products is critical to our growth 
microelectronic device manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
we continue to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems  new models to existing system series and improvements or enhancements on current models 
due to the length of the product development cycles in our industries  we must make these significant time and resource expenditures well in advance of any prospect of a revenue stream from such new products 
if our customers do not continue to accept our current products and also accept and integrate our new products into their operations  our revenue  cash flow  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our growth expectations are dependent on successfully penetrating the front end of the microelectronic device manufacturing process 
we have recently introduced the axi series and exi series which address inspection and metrology needs in the front end of the microelectronic device manufacturing process  a market segment that we have limited experience in serving 
we are not a well recognized supplier to this market  and will need to establish new customer relationships and win the confidence of these customers to compete effectively in this market 
the front end of the microelectronic device manufacturing market is dominated by large  well established competitors with significantly greater resources and name recognition than we have 
in order to compete effectively with these larger competitors  we must develop process and applications expertise to identify the inspection needs of this market and produce cost effective  technologically advanced solutions addressing these needs 
in addition  we must create and execute programs to effectively service these customers 
failure to successfully penetrate the front end of the microelectronic device manufacturing market would adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes by developing and introducing successful new products and technologies in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete and our business will be harmed 
the microelectronic capital equipment manufacturing business is a highly competitive business and microelectronic device manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing product line to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products  such as the nsx series and the di series  or our new product development efforts such as the axi series and exi series  will be successful or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological change 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will choose the most opportunistic new markets and applications 
we continue to make and or review significant investments in research  development and engineering in new technology and or businesses with new or complementary products  services and or technologies  and we are aware of the numerous risks associated therewith  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from day to day operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  failure to commercialize the new technology or business  failure to meet the expected performance of the new technology or business  lower than expected market opportunities or market acceptance of any new products  and unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products 
if we are unsuccessful at developing new products and technologies  our revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our products are complex and any product or process development issues could negatively impact our operations or financial results 
our products are complex and often the applications of our customers are unique 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to meet our customers functionality and reliability requirements in a timely manner 
we cannot be sure that our product offerings  application assistance  enhancement efforts  or our new product development efforts will fulfill every functionality and reliability requirement 
in addition  new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance  thereby delaying revenue recognition 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our market share  revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our market is highly competitive and we may lose business to larger and better financed competitors 
the microelectronic defect inspection equipment industry is highly competitive in all areas of the world 
we have many domestic and foreign competitors 
our current primary competitors in final manufacturing are camtek ltd  hitachi  ltd  robotic vision systems  inc and toray industries  inc as we enter the front end market  we expect to compete with larger competitors  such as kla tencor corporation and rudolph technologies  inc  for certain automated macro inspection applications 
most of these competitors  as well as other potential competitors  have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support capabilities than we have 
unless we are able to invest significant financial resources in developing products and enhancing customer support worldwide  and are able to gain customer acceptance of our products  we may not be able to compete effectively 
as we continue to diversify into the evolving and emerging microelectronic markets  including semiconductors  advanced packaging  optoelectronics  mems  flat panel display  printheads  data storage  disk drives  medical devices and other similar devices  further competitors may enter our markets  or we may enter the markets of other companies 
our operations could be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions beyond our control or similar events  including global or regional outbreaks of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
disasters such as earthquakes  flooding  fire  electricity failure  or accidents that affect our operations  manufacturing facility  or the health of our employees or customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
continued or future outbreaks of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  avian flu  or other similar or comparable outbreaks or fears or concerns of possible outbreaks may significantly affect the willingness or ability of our customers to visit our facilities or trade shows  review our systems capabilities and or purchase or take delivery of our products  as well as our ability to visit our customers  to perform application studies for our customers  to sell and deliver products  and to service those products 
any government mandated or suggested restrictions on travel  quarantines  or declines in the willingness or ability of our customers to travel and visit our facilities or our ability to travel and visit our customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain the necessary resources to invest in our growth 
we intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges  which include the need to develop new products or enhance existing products  enhance our operating infrastructure  acquire complementary businesses and technologies and satisfy working capital requirements 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds 
equity and debt financing  however  might not be available when needed or  if available  might not be available on terms satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical  manufacturing  managerial  financial and marketing personnel 
the labor market in which we operate is highly competitive and as a result  we may not be able to retain and recruit key personnel 
our failure to hire  retain  or adequately train key personnel could have a negative impact on our performance 
in addition  during the recent microelectronic industry downturn we have had reductions in our work force  reduced or eliminated salary increases and for certain periods implemented pay cuts at the management level  and reduced discretionary spending 
any of the above measures may have long term adverse effects on our ability to retain key personnel 
our business may be harmed if we fail to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and our products under development 
to protect these rights  we have obtained four domestic patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
as of december   we have pending patent applications in the united states and additional international applications and expect our portfolio to grow in the future 
the process of seeking intellectual property protection can be time consuming and expensive 
we cannot ensure that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us  foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights  or others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our technology 
if we do not successfully protect and then enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees  consultants  key customers and vendors to protect our intellectual property 
other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these people 
third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs  licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to those intellectual property rights or to alter our products so that they no longer infringe 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
we may become responsible for patent litigation costs 
if we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property  whether ours or that of another company  we may have to participate in legal proceedings 
these types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us  even if we eventually prevail 
if we do not prevail  we might be forced to pay significant damages  obtain licenses  modify our products or processes  stop making products or stop using processes 
we have initiated litigation against rudolph technologies  inc and its subsidiary  we may incur significant legal costs and  if we lose  additional financial obligations 
on september   we filed a complaint in the district court of dallas county  texas seeking a declaratory judgment that we have no liability to rudolph technologies  inc or its subsidiary  isoa  inc 
doing business as yield metrology group with respect to claims they have asserted against us and our subsidiary  sti 
in addition  we are seeking a judgment against rudolph and isoa for repayment of royalties previously paid by sti to isoa and costs and attorney s fees incurred in bringing this action 
in various letters and conversations with sti and us  rudolph has asserted that sti owes rudolph development fees and royalty payments pursuant to a december  development agreement between sti and isoa  inc  which rudolph later acquired and renamed yield metrology group 
rudolph has also asserted that we may have used isoa technology in the development of one of our products and owe additional royalties to rudolph as a result 
we may incur significant legal fees and expenses in pursuing this action for a declaratory judgment 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation and we may suffer an adverse result requiring us to pay damages or royalties adversely affecting our business 
our dependence on a few significant customers exposes us to operating risks 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
our customers are able to cancel orders  prior to shipment  with few or no penalties 
if a significant customer reduces orders or delays shipments for any reason  our revenues  operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected 
in addition  our ability to increase our sales will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers for whom there is intense competition 
our dependence on subcontractors and sole or limited source suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis and could result in disruption of our operations 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of our components 
our reliance on subcontractors reduces the level of control we have over the manufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks such as inadequate capacity  late delivery  substandard quality and high costs 
if a supplier were to become unable to provide parts in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply  or manufacture the components internally 
depending on the part  the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers generally takes between and days 
we generally do not have written supply agreements with our single or limited source suppliers and purchase our custom components through blanket and individual purchase orders 
if we were unable to obtain these components in a timely fashion  we may not be able to meet demands for future shipments 
we believe that we would be able to find alternative solutions if supplies were unavailable from any of our sole source suppliers  including the supplier of our image processing component 
this may take time and the disruption would adversely affect our results of operations 
we assemble and test all of our products at a single facility  and any disruption in the operations of that facility could adversely impact our business and operating results 
our processes for manufacturing our automated inspection systems require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility 
we assemble and test all of our automated inspection systems at one facility located in bloomington  minnesota 
any disruption in the operation of that facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction or damage from fire or earthquake  infrastructure failures such as power or water shortage or any other reason  could interrupt our manufacturing operations  impair critical systems  disrupt communications with our customers and suppliers and cause us to write off inventory and to lose sales 
failure to adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents in an accurate and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer acceptance of our products could adversely affect our financial position and earnings 
our earnings could be harmed and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products 
any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position  while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products thus adversely affecting our revenues 
our dependence upon international customers and suppliers may reduce our revenues or impede our ability to supply products 
international sales have accounted for a significant and growing portion of our revenues in recent years and we expect that the percentage of sales from international customers will continue to increase 
sales outside of the united states accounted for  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
in addition  we rely on non us suppliers for several components of the systems we sell 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and the ability to manufacture our products are subject to the risks associated with international commerce 
international sales and our relationships with suppliers and customers may be hurt by many factors  including changes in law or policy resulting in burdensome government controls  tariffs  restrictions  embargoes or export license requirements  political or economic instability in our target international markets  instability caused by infectious disease or other like outbreaks  or the threat or concern thereof  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws making it harder to protect our technology from appropriation by competitors  difficulties in collecting our accounts receivable because of the geographic distance and unfavorable creditor laws  and currency fluctuations may increase the relative price of our products in foreign markets and thereby adversely affect sales 
we are also subject to risks associated with shipping products outside of the us including shipping delays  varying business conditions  differing business cultures and cultural diversities  among other risks 
if our international sales or relationships with international suppliers and customers are adversely affected by any of these factors  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
our financial performance is highly dependent upon sales to customers in asia 
sales to customers in asia accounted for  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect our dependence upon the asian market to increase 
in recent years  asia has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations  debt defaults  lack of liquidity and recessions 
our revenues depend upon the capital expenditures of microelectronic manufacturers  many of whom have operations and customers in asia 
serious economic problems in asia would likely result in a significant decrease in the sale of equipment to microelectronic industries 
if we are unable to maintain our customer relationships in asia  our future financial condition  revenues and operating results will be negatively affected 
we will continue to rely upon distributors for a portion of our future sales  and a disruption in our relationships with these distributors could have a negative impact on our international sales 
sales through our independent distributors represented  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
one distributor accounts for a significant portion of these sales 
the activities of these distributors are not fully within our control 
although we believe that we maintain good relations with our independent distributors  the relationships may nevertheless deteriorate in the future 
a reduction in the sales or service efforts or financial viability of any of our independent distributors  or a termination of our relationships with them  could harm our sales  our financial results and our ability to support our customers 
we recently acquired sti and csi and we may make other acquisitions  the acquisitions of sti and csi and any future acquisitions may not be successful and may adversely affect our business 
we are looking for strategic opportunities to grow and diversify our product offerings through acquisitions 
in this regard  we recently completed the acquisitions of sti and csi 
your evaluation of our business and prospects may be difficult because of our limited operating history with sti and csi 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating the operations of sti and csi  identifying other appropriate candidates  or integrating products and operations with any such candidates that we may acquire 
any such acquisition could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and the incurrence of debt 
in addition  the acquisitions of sti and csi and future acquisitions may involve numerous additional risks  including the diversion of the attention of our management team from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience  including difficulties in integrating purchased technologies and products with our technologies and products  the potential loss of key customers of an acquired company  the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired company  exposure to unanticipated liabilities of an acquired company  and greater financial requirements for purchase price and added working capital 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that the products will continue to be successful  that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to the acquired company or its products 
if a microelectronic device manufacturer is loyal to another microelectronic equipment supplier  we may be unable to sell our products to that potential customer and our sales and market share could suffer as a result 
we believe that once a microelectronic device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production line application  the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line  a microelectronic device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application 
if we are required to account for stock options as a compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced 
some companies have begun to account for stock options as compensation expense thus resulting in a reduction of their net income and earnings per share 
we currently grant all options at fair market value and do not record compensation expense in connection with the grants 
it is possible that future laws  regulations or changes in accounting standards will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as a compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
if such a change occurs  our net income and earnings per share may be significantly reduced 
if we cannot effectively manage our growth  our business may suffer 
we intend to continue to grow by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions 
to effectively manage our growth  we must  among other things engage  train and manage a larger sales force and additional service personnel  expand the geographic coverage of our sales force  expand our information systems  identify and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations  and administer appropriate financial and administrative control procedures 
our anticipated growth will likely place a significant strain on our management  financial  operational  technical  sales and administrative resources 
any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline 
increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices 
we expect our current competitors and other companies to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may from time to time require us to selectively reduce prices on our systems in an effort to protect our market share 
even if we reduce prices  our potential customers may choose to purchase competing products developed by our competitors  many of whom have development  production  marketing and distribution resources significantly greater than our own 
price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenues and adversely impact our financial results 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we do not have material exposure to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because all sales are made in us dollars 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from investments in cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable debt securities the investment portfolio 
the entire investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and  accordingly  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the entire investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in the investment portfolio 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of securities in the investment portfolio and trade receivables 
we limit credit risk related to the investment portfolio by placing all investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer 
as of december   of the investment portfolio consisted of government securities and corporate commercial paper and bonds with maturities of one year or less 
we limit credit risk associated with trade receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations and believe that there is no additional risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses to be inherent in trade receivables
