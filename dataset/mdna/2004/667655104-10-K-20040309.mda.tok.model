item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to the consolidated activities of the company for the three years ended dec 
 unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include regulated utility o northwest natural gas company nw natural non regulated wholly owned subsidiaries of nw natural o nng financial corporation financial corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries o northwest energy corporation northwest energy  and its wholly owned subsidiary together these businesses are referred to herein as the company see results of operations non utility operations  below  and note 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact the company s earnings and are reported net of tax 
the company believes this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on the company s earnings 
all references in this report to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
executive summary highlights among its accomplishments in  the company o grew its utility customer base by more than percent for the th year in a row  adding  customers to its gas distribution system during the year  o increased earnings from its business segment for interstate gas storage services from cents a share in to cents a share in  o secured a permit for the construction of a major extension of its pipeline from the mist storage field to the portland metropolitan area and completed the first mile segment of the pipeline extension  below budget and on time for the heating season  o successfully completed its general rate case in oregon with a result that included phased rate increases  the recovery of costs relating to its gas storage investments and higher operating expenses  and approval of a new weather normalization mechanism  o secured reliable and adequate gas supplies during a time of volatile wholesale pricing  at costs that required only relatively small rate increases for customers  and o paid dividends on common stock of a share  making the th consecutive year in which the company s dividend payments have increased 
issues  challenges and performance measures issues and challenges the company expects to face in include the effects and uncertainties relating to a general rate case in washington  volatile gas commodity prices  continuing weak economic conditions in oregon and washington  completion of the remaining portion of the pipeline extension from nw natural s mist gas storage field including the acquisition of rights of way necessary to build the pipeline  and higher capital and operating costs due to federal mandates in the area of pipeline integrity 
in order to deal with these and other issues affecting the business  in nw natural completed a new strategic plan to map the company s course during the next several years 
the plan includes strategies for further improving nw natural s ability to add customers both profitably and at a rapid pace  maintaining nw natural s reputation for exemplary service  reducing business risk  managing all costs  including capital costs  holding all employees to high performance standards  and judiciously growing beyond the company s local distribution business where it would complement core assets and competencies 
among the key performance measures the company will use in monitoring progress against its goals in these areas are utility earnings per share  customer satisfaction ratings  new customer additions  operations and maintenance expense per customer  construction cost per meter connected  and non revenue producing capital expenditures per customer 
earnings and dividends the company s earnings applicable to common stock in were million  compared to million in and million in earnings were a share in  compared to a share in and a share in net operating revenues in were about the same as in  but higher amounts for other income million in more than offset higher operating expenses million 
earnings for were reduced by charges of million before tax representing the company s transaction costs incurred in its efforts to acquire portland general electric company pge from enron 
excluding these charges  earnings per share from consolidated operations in would have been a share 
earnings for were the highest on record for the company 
nw natural earned a diluted share from gas utility operations in  compared to a share in both and weather conditions in its service territory in were percent warmer than the year average and percent warmer than temperatures in were very close to average but were percent warmer than weather in was percent colder than average 
results in from the company s non utility operations were earnings of cents a share  including cents a share from nw natural s gas storage business segment and cents a share from subsidiary and other non utility operations see results of operations non utility operations  below 
non utility results for were a loss of cents a share  including earnings of cents a share from the gas storage segment  a loss of cents a share relating to the company s efforts to purchase pge  and earnings of cents a share from other subsidiary and non utility operations 
non utility results for were earnings of cents a share  including cents a share from the gas storage segment 
for the th consecutive year  the company s dividends paid on common stock increased in dividends paid on common stock were a share in compared to a share in and a share in application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the company s financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers its critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if the company reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company s most critical estimates or judgments involve regulatory cost recovery  unbilled revenues  derivative instruments  pension assumptions  and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
regulatory accounting nw natural is regulated by the public utility commission of oregon opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc  which establish rules governing the company s utility rates and services  and to a certain extent set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  nw natural uses the same accounting principles as other non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of regulation 
for example  nw natural accounts for the cost of gas using a deferral and cost recovery mechanism called the purchased gas adjustment pga  which is approved annually by the opuc and wutc see results of operations cost of gas sold  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require the company to defer and recover or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires the company to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when nw natural is allowed to recover these expenses from or refund them to customers  it recognizes the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time it realizes the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates and charged to customers 
the conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
include o an independent regulator sets rates  o the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and o the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
nw natural applies sfas no 
in accounting for its regulated utility operations 
the company periodically assesses whether it can continue to apply sfas no 
if nw natural should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 then it would be required to write off the net unrecoverable balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities as a charge to income 
revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when the gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require management s judgment  including total gas receipts and deliveries  customer usage patterns and weather 
unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
nw natural s unbilled revenues at dec 
 and were million and million  respectively 
in november  nw natural implemented a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that helps stabilize the company s net operating revenues by adjusting current customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from gas storage services  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from optimization of excess storage and transportation capacity are recognized over the life of the contract for guaranteed amounts under the contract  or are recognized as earned for amounts above the guaranteed value 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company s derivatives policy sets forth the guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters see note 
the policy specifically prohibits the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s primary hedging activities consist of natural gas commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate hedges  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the company s commodity and foreign currency hedge transactions are included in the annual pga mechanism  and as such all gains and losses are subject to regulatory deferral under sfas no 
see regulatory accounting  above 
the following table summarizes the realized gains and losses from nw natural s commodity and currency hedge transactions in  and thousands gains losses on commodity swap contracts    gains losses on commodity option contracts    subtotal    gains on currency contracts  total gains losses on commodity and currency contracts    realized gains losses from commodity and foreign currency hedge contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market valuations are not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are reported as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  which are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions nw natural has two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering all regular employees with more than one year of service 
these plans are funded through a trust dedicated to providing retirement benefits 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below  and note  using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
nw natural s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of actuarial gains and losses  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
variances between expected returns and actual investment returns are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the dec 
 measurement date  the company o decreased its discount rate assumption from percent to percent  o lowered its salary and wage increase assumption from a range of percent to a range of percent  and o increased its expected long term return on plan assets from percent to percent 
changes in these factors were the primary contributors to a net increase in the company s accumulated benefit obligation from million at dec 
  to million at dec 
 the company believes its pension assumptions to be appropriate based upon the above factors 
however  if the discount rate were changed by one quarter percentage point  the net periodic pension cost would be changed by approximately million 
if the expected return on plan assets were changed by one quarter percentage point  the net periodic pension cost would be changed by approximately million 
contingencies the company records loss contingencies as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
in the normal course of business  the company records accruals for loss contingencies based on an analysis of potential results  developed in consultation with outside counsel when appropriate  including allowances for uncollectible accounts  environmental claims and property damage and personal injury claims 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or estimates regarding these contingencies 
with respect to environmental claims  the company records receivables for anticipated recoveries under insurance contracts  or from future utility rates  when recovery is probable 
see note results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing over percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by nw natural s ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain reasonable and timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases in august  the opuc entered an order covering all of the issues in nw natural s first oregon general rate case since the order included  among other things  i the settlement of nw natural s cost of service  including operations and maintenance expenses  ii projected investments for the prospective test year  iii a capital structure including percent common equity  iv a return on common shareholders equity roe of percent  v a rate redesign that shifted million of margin revenue requirement from industrial rate schedules to residential and commercial rate schedules  and vi the adoption of a weather normalization mechanism 
the order authorized a revenue increase of million per year  of which million went into effect on sept 
 and million went into effect on a deferred basis on nov 
 as the first miles of the company s south mist pipeline extension smpe was placed into service 
the remainder will go into effect as all or portions of the smpe project and the company s coos county distribution system project are completed and go into service in see financial condition investing activities  below 
nw natural s most recent general rate increase in washington  which was fully effective in october  authorized rates designed to produce an roe of percent 
the wutc approved a revenue increase of million per year  or percent 
in november  nw natural filed a new general rate case in washington 
the filing proposes a revenue increase of million per year from washington operations through rate increases averaging percent 
the proposed rates are designed to produce an roe of percent and to recover increases in nw natural s cost of service including costs for expansion of the mist gas storage system and construction of a new service center in vancouver  higher expenses in areas such as pensions  health benefits and insurance  and revenue declines due to changes in customers consumption patterns 
nw natural also is proposing a decoupling mechanism for residential and commercial customers that includes weather normalization  and a re design of industrial rates 
the schedule for the case provides for settlement conferences in april  the filing of wutc staff and intervenor testimony in may  hearings in july and a decision by the wutc determining new rates by the end of october the company is unable to determine the extent to which its proposals will be accepted by the wutc 
rate mechanisms the weather normalization mechanism approved by the opuc will be applied to nw natural s oregon residential and commercial customers bills between nov 
and may of each heating season  beginning november the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect normal weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
rate changes are applied each year under the pga mechanisms in nw natural s tariffs in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the costs of natural gas commodity purchased under contracts with gas producers see comparison of gas operations cost of gas sold  below  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in regulatory asset or liability accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
in  the opuc approved a rate increase averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved a rate increase averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in  the opuc approved pga rate decreases averaging percent for nw natural s oregon sales customers and the wutc approved pga rate decreases averaging percent for nw natural s washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in  the opuc approved pga rate increases averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved pga rate increases averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in an order issued in  the opuc formalized a process that tests for excessive earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings under their pga mechanisms 
the opuc confirmed nw natural s ability to pass through percent of its prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this order  nw natural is authorized to retain all of its earnings up to a threshold level equal to its authorized roe plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
no amounts were identified in this process for refund to customers with respect to nw natural s earnings results in or nw natural does not expect there will be amounts identified for refund with respect to its earnings in  which will be reviewed by the opuc in the second quarter of in  the opuc approved a rate mechanism designed to stabilize margin revenues in the face of above or below normal consumption patterns 
nw natural believes that reductions in recent years in its customers gas consumptions per degree day see comparison of gas operations residential and commercial  below were caused by increases in the cost of purchased gas that were passed on to customers as rate increases  and to efforts throughout the region to conserve energy 
the mechanism adjusts for rate changes according to the impact of price elasticity  starting with small increases to residential and commercial rates that became effective on oct 
 these rate changes contributed an estimated million of margin  equivalent to cents a share of earnings  during the fourth quarter of and an estimated million of margin  equivalent to cents a share of earnings  during the first eight months of before the oregon general rate increase took effect 
in addition  the opuc authorized nw natural to implement a partial decoupling mechanism effective oct 
 decoupling mechanisms are used to break the link between a utility s earnings and the energy consumed by its customers so the utility does not have an incentive to discourage customers conservation efforts 
the decoupling mechanism works by adding margin revenues during periods when customer consumptions are lower than baseline consumption or by deducting margin revenues when consumptions are higher than the baseline 
under the partial decoupling mechanism  nw natural uses a balancing account to defer and subsequently amortize percent of the margin differentials between baseline usage by its residential and commercial customers and weather normalized actual usage by these customers 
the deferred amounts are treated as adjustments to be refunded or collected in future periods 
baseline consumption is based on customer consumption patterns determined in the oregon general rate case  adjusted for consumptions resulting from new customers 
the partial decoupling mechanism will expire at the end of september unless the opuc approves an extension based on the results of an independent study to measure the mechanism s effectiveness 
in connection with the opuc s approval of the decoupling mechanism  nw natural agreed to adopt certain service quality measures that establish the company s performance goal for minimizing complaints by customers where the company is determined to be at fault 
if nw natural exceeds the prescribed level of at fault complaints  it will be subject to penalties 
nw natural was not subject to penalties relating to these measures in comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec 
thousands  except customers and degree days utility gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales    unbilled volumes    weather sensitive volumes    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation deliveries    total volumes sold and delivered    utility operating revenues dollars residential and commercial sales    unbilled revenues    weather sensitive revenues    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation revenues    other revenues    total utility operating revenues    cost of gas sold    utility net operating revenues margin    total number of customers end of period    actual degree days    year average degree days    nw natural refunded deferred gas cost savings to its oregon customers through billing credits in june these refunds were the customers percent portion of gas cost savings realized between october and march  which had been deferred  with interest  pursuant to nw natural s pga tariff in oregon see cost of gas sold  below 
the refunds reduced gross operating revenues during by million  and reduced both cost of gas and deferred gas costs payable by million 
the refunds also reduced margin by about million  but this amount was almost entirely offset by corresponding reductions in franchise tax expense and uncollectible accounts expense such that the effect of the refunds on net income was negligible 
residential and commercial sales nw natural continued to grow its customer base  with a net increase of  customers during this represents a growth rate of percent  compared to percent in and percent in in the three years ended dec 
  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers were percent lower in than in  reflecting warmer weather that was partially offset by customer growth and the price elasticity effects of lower rates 
related revenues were percent lower in than in excluding the impact of gas cost refunds totaling million to oregon customers during  related revenues were million  or percent  lower in than in  primarily due to lower rates effective oct 
 see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers were percent lower in than in  reflecting warmer weather as well as lower consumption patterns by customers due to higher gas commodity prices included in rates in previous years 
excluding the impact of the refunds to oregon customers during  related revenues increased percent  primarily due to pga rate increases effective oct 
 typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers 
weather conditions in were percent warmer than average 
temperatures were very close to average in and percent colder than average in weather in was percent warmer than and was percent warmer than average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
in november  nw natural implemented a weather normalization mechanism that will be applied to oregon residential and commercial customers bills between nov 
and may of each heating season see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
customers may opt out of the mechanism during a defined period each year  less than percent of nw natural s oregon residential and commercial customers opted out during its first heating season 
the mechanism contributed million of margin in the fourth quarter of due to warmer than average weather 
the contribution was equivalent to cents a share of earnings  making up a significant portion of the weather related margin loss in that quarter 
in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered and sold to customers  but not yet billed  through the end of the period 
amounts reported as unbilled revenues reflect the increase or decrease in the balance of unbilled revenues over the prior year end 
weather conditions  rate changes and customer billing dates from one period to the next affect year end balances 
industrial sales and transportation the following table summarizes the delivered volumes and utility net operating revenues margin in the industrial and electric generation markets thousands delivered volumes therms industrial sales and transportation    electric generation    total volumes    utility net operating revenues dollars industrial sales and transportation    electric generation   total margin    total volumes delivered to industrial and electric generation customers were percent lower in than in  and percent higher in than in combined margins from these customers were percent lower in than in and percent lower in than in excluding electric generation customers  volumes delivered to end use industrial sales and transportation customers were percent lower and margin was percent lower in than in results from the industrial market in reflect weak economic conditions during the year  as well as some cost related changes in the design of industrial rates in the oregon general rate case that reduced industrial margins in the fourth quarter 
volumes delivered to industrial customers were percent higher in than in  but margin was percent lower 
the decline in margin from these customers in was due to migrations of some industrial customers from higher margin firm service to lower margin interruptible service and to plant shutdowns or cutbacks in the manufacturing sector because of economic conditions 
nw natural re designed its industrial rates in oregon as part of its general rate case in  transferring million of annual revenue requirement from industrial rates to residential and commercial rates in order to better reflect relative costs of service and to become more competitive in the industrial market 
in the electric generation market  margin was negligible in but was million and million in and  respectively  equivalent to cents a share in each year 
more than percent of the margin  but only about percent of the gas deliveries  in and was from two customers that were served under contracts that went into effect in the second half of and expired at the end of the second quarter of most of the margin from these contracts was from fixed charges 
a third electric generation customer used million therms in and million therms in under contracts with low volumetric charges 
other revenues other revenues include revenues and revenue adjustments from sources other than the sale and transportation of gas see note  including deferrals to and amortizations from regulatory asset and liability accounts and miscellaneous customer fees 
in  other revenues contributed million to utility operating revenues compared to million in and a negative million in other revenues in included positive contributions due to amortizations of regulatory accounts covering customer consumption under nw natural s decoupling mechanism see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above  amortizations of income shared with customers from interstate gas storage services  and customer late payment and collection fees and miscellaneous revenues  partially offset by amortizations from regulatory accounts covering conservation programs and year costs 
the following table summarizes other revenues by primary category in  and thousands rate adjustments decoupling deferrals   decoupling amortizations interstate storage amortization   conservation programs amortization    year amortization   miscellaneous revenues customer fees    other   total other revenues    cost of gas sold natural gas commodity prices have fluctuated dramatically in recent years 
nw natural has sought to mitigate the effect of higher gas commodity prices and price volatility on core utility customers through the use of its underground storage facilities  by entering into gas commodity based financial hedge contracts  and by making short term sales of gas commodity and transportation capacity to on system or off system customers in periods when core utility customers do not fully utilize firm pipeline capacity and gas supplies 
in  the company replaced all of its expiring long term contracts with supply contracts for gas purchases of similar aggregate volume levels 
all of the new contracts have terms of five years or less and contain commodity price provisions that are tied directly to monthly market index prices for the term of the contract 
the company enters into financial hedge contracts that are intended to have the effect of converting these monthly market index prices into fixed prices for most of its gas purchases under these contracts 
the cost per therm of gas sold was percent lower in than in  and percent higher in than in the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  demand cost balancing adjustments demand equalization  regulatory deferrals and company use 
results for included an adjustment that reduced cost of gas by million see comparison of gas operations  above 
excluding this adjustment  cost per therm of gas sold was percent lower in than in  reflecting decreases in gas commodity prices effective in late  and percent higher in than in  reflecting increases in gas commodity prices effective in late results for also included adjustments reducing cost of gas relating to amounts of deferred expenses for the recovery of pipeline demand charges under nw natural s pga mechanism 
these adjustments contributed cents a share to earnings in  of which cents a share applied to periods prior to the rate methodology represented in the adjustments continues to be applied in the company s accounting for pipeline demand charges 
nw natural s recorded amount of unaccounted for gas was percent of gas sendout in  compared to percent in unaccounted for gas is the difference between the amount of gas the company receives from all sources  including pipeline deliveries and withdrawals from storage  and the amount of gas it delivers to customers or other delivery points 
unaccounted for gas may be caused in part by physical gas leakage  but it also may be due to cumulative inaccuracies in gas metering  estimates of unbilled gas or other causes 
nw natural considers a normal amount of unaccounted for gas to be percent of its total gas sendout during a period  but the amount may vary within a range around this estimate 
during  the lower estimated amount of unaccounted for gas had the effect of reducing cost of gas and increasing margin by million as compared to nw natural uses a natural gas commodity price hedge program under the terms of its derivatives policy to help manage its variable price gas commodity contracts see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  above 
nw natural recorded net hedging gains of million from this program during  compared to net hedging losses of million in and net hedging gains of million in  with negligible impact on net income in any of those years 
hedging gains and losses relating to gas commodity purchases are included in cost of gas and factored into nw natural s annual pga rate adjustments 
under nw natural s pga tariff in oregon  net income from oregon operations is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
nw natural is allowed to collect an amount for purchased gas costs based on estimates that are included in current utility rates 
if the actual purchased gas costs are higher than the amounts included in rates  nw natural is not allowed to charge its customers currently for those higher gas costs but is allowed to defer the costs and collect them in the future 
similarly  when the actual purchased gas costs are lower than the amount included in rates  the savings are not immediately passed on to customers but are deferred and refunded in future periods 
nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the projected costs built into rates 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs is recorded as deferred regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
nw natural s gas costs in were slightly lower than the gas costs embedded in rates  with the effect that nw natural s share of the lower costs increased margin by million  equivalent to less than cent a share of earnings 
in and  nw natural s gas costs were much lower than the projected costs built into rates and the company s share of the savings realized from gas purchases contributed million and million of margin  equivalent to cents a share and cents a share of earnings  respectively 
due to the warm weather and the reduced gas requirements of its industrial sales customers during  nw natural was able to use gas supplies that were under contract for the winter season  but were not required for delivery to core market customers  to make off system gas sales 
the company s purchase prices for this gas had been locked in through commodity swap and call option agreements entered into in the prior year at levels lower than market prices during under the pga tariff  the margin from these sales is treated as a reduction to cost of gas  with the effect that percent is deferred for refund to nw natural s customers and the remaining percent is retained by the company 
nw natural s share of the margin from off system gas sales in was million  equivalent to cents a share of earnings  compared to margin of million or cents a share of earnings in and margin of million or cents a share of earnings in non utility operations at dec 
 and  the company s non utility operations consisted of gas storage operations and two wholly owned subsidiaries  financial corporation and northwest energy 
of the subsidiaries  only financial corporation had active operations during and gas storage nw natural realized net income from its non utility gas storage business segment in  after regulatory sharing and income taxes  of million or cents a share  compared to million or cents a share in and million or cents a share in gas storage services include sales to off system interstate customers using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of core utility customers requirements 
nw natural retains percent of the income before tax from gas storage services and credits the remaining percent to a deferred regulatory account for distribution to its core utility customers 
results for the gas storage business segment also include revenues  net of amounts shared with core utility customers  from a contract with an independent energy trading company that seeks to optimize the use of nw natural s assets by trading temporarily unused portions of its gas storage capacity and upstream pipeline transportation capacity 
nw natural retains percent of the pre tax income from the optimization of storage and pipeline transportation capacity when the costs of such capacity have not been included in core utility rates  or percent of the pre tax income from such capacity when the costs have been included in core utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for distribution to nw natural s core utility customers 
financial corporation financial corporation s operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the decrease in net income in compared to was primarily due to lower income from investments in limited partnerships in wind and solar electric generation projects in california  and lower miscellaneous receivables 
the increase in net income in compared to was due to higher income from these investments 
the company s investment in financial corporation at dec 
  was million  compared to million and million at dec 
 and  respectively 
the reduced investment in financial corporation at dec 
  was primarily due to a million cash dividend that financial corporation paid to nw natural in the fourth quarter of northwest energy northwest energy was formed in to serve as the holding company for nw natural and pge if the acquisition of pge had been completed 
northwest energy recorded nominal expenses for corporate development activities in upon the termination of the proposed acquisition effort in  northwest energy recorded a loss totaling million after tax for the transaction costs incurred in connection with this effort 
these charges were equivalent to cents a share 
operating expenses operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses of million in were million  or percent  higher than in the increase was primarily due to higher operating payroll costs from added positions and wage  salary  vacation and bonus increases million  higher pension costs including the impact of changes in actuarial assumptions million see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below  higher premiums for health care and prescription drug coverage million  higher renewal premiums on business risk insurance million  higher employee benefit costs million  higher professional services fees million  and higher expenses relating to workers compensation million and other operating costs million 
these cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense million due to lower net write offs of accounts receivable compared to  when customer bills and subsequent write offs were impacted by higher gas prices and colder weather 
most of the cost increases nw natural experienced in were recognized in the rate increases resulting from the company s general rate case in oregon see regulatory matters general rate cases  above 
operations and maintenance expenses of million in were million  or percent  higher than in the increase in resulted primarily from higher pension costs million  higher premiums for health care and prescription drug coverage million  higher payroll costs due to wage and salary increases and incentive bonus accruals million and higher renewal premiums on business risk insurance million  partially offset by a litigation reserve in million  lower information technology expenses million and lower uncollectible accounts expense million 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes  which are principally comprised of property  franchise and payroll taxes  increased million  or percent  in over property taxes increased million  or percent  due to utility plant additions and slightly higher property tax rates 
franchise taxes  regulatory fees and payroll tax expenses accounted for the remaining million increase 
in  taxes other than income taxes increased million  or percent  over property taxes increased million  or percent  due to utility plant additions and higher property tax rates 
depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes the increases in total plant and property and total depreciation and amortization for the three years ended dec

 short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of commercial paper notes  which are supported by commercial bank lines of credit 
the company has available through sept 
  committed lines of credit with four commercial banks see lines of credit  below  and note 
nw natural s capital expenditures are primarily related to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements see cash flows investing activities  below 
in addition  nw natural has certain contractual commitments under capital leases  operating leases and gas supply purchase and other contracts that require an adequate source of funding 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
in october  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec registering million of medium term notes  series b mtns 
this filing became effective in january pursuant to this registration statement  during the company issued million of mtns and used the proceeds to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances and to fund  in part  nw natural s ongoing utility construction program see financing activities  below 
in february  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the registration of million of securities  which may include first mortgage bonds  unsecured debt  preferred stock and common stock 
concurrent with the february shelf filing  the company withdrew from registration the million of mtns remaining on its previous shelf registration 
the million universal shelf registration statement became effective in february neither nw natural s mortgage and deed of trust nor the indentures under which other long term debt is issued contain credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for agreements with certain counter parties under nw natural s derivatives policy which require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letter of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade  or in some cases if the mark to market value exceeds a certain threshold 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table shows the company s contractual obligations by maturity and type of obligation 
nw natural also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans see note

 thereafter total commercial paper   long term debt       capital leases operating leases        gas supply commitments        smpe commitments   other purchase commitments   total        smpe commitments in primarily consist of obligations nw natural has to a general contractor to complete the construction of the remaining portion of the smpe project 
a construction contract is in place for one segment of the pipeline and an additional contract is currently being negotiated for the remainder of the project 
other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders 
these and other contractual obligations are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
holders of certain mtns have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate the maturity of long term debt by million in  million in and million in commercial paper the company s primary source of short term funds is commercial paper notes payable 
both nw natural and financial corporation issue commercial paper under agency agreements with a commercial bank 
nw natural s commercial paper is supported by its committed bank lines of credit see lines of credit  below  while financial corporation s commercial paper is supported by committed bank lines of credit and the guaranty of nw natural see note 
nw natural had million in commercial paper notes outstanding at dec 
  compared to million outstanding at dec 
 financial corporation had no commercial paper notes outstanding at dec 
 or lines of credit nw natural has lines of credit with four commercial banks totaling million 
half of the credit facility with each bank  totaling million  is committed and available through sept 
  and the other million is committed and available through sept 
 nw natural may be unable to draw upon the two year portions of the credit lines  totaling million  until filings are made or approvals received from the opuc or the wutc with respect to its notes relating to the two year commitments 
nw natural expects that it will be able to make the necessary filings or secure such approvals  if required 
in addition  financial corporation has available through sept 
  committed lines of credit with two commercial banks totaling million 
financial corporation s lines are supported by the guaranty of nw natural 
under the terms of these lines of credit  nw natural and financial corporation pay commitment fees but are not required to maintain compensating bank balances 
the interest rates on borrowings under these lines of credit  if any  are based on current market rates 
there were no outstanding balances on either the nw natural or financial corporation lines of credit at dec 
 or nw natural s lines of credit require that credit ratings be maintained in effect at all times and that notice be given of any change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
a change in nw natural s credit rating is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating a condition to drawing upon the lines of credit 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under nw natural s bank lines are tied to credit ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of bank debt  if any  when ratings are changed 
the lines of credit require the company to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less and to maintain a consolidated net worth at least equal to percent of its net worth at sept 
  plus percent of the company s net income for each subsequent fiscal quarter 
failure to comply with either of these covenants would entitle the banks to terminate their lending commitments and to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
the company was in compliance with both of these covenants at dec 
  and with the equivalent covenants in the prior year s lines of credit at dec 
 optional redemptions of long term debt and redeemable preferred stock in  the company exercised early redemption provisions applicable to certain of its long term debt  including all million of the series b mtns due  all million of the series b mtns due  and all million of the series b mtns due these mtns were redeemed in the third quarter of at percent  percent and percent of their respective principal amounts

the company redeemed the mtns and the preferred stock with available cash or with the proceeds from sales of commercial paper  and re financed this long term debt and preferred stock through the sale of new long term debt in the fourth quarter of early redemption premiums are recognized as unamortized costs on debt redemptions pursuant to sfas no 
and are amortized to expense over the life of the new debt 
cash flows operating activities operations provided net cash of million in compared to million in the percent decrease was due to a decrease in cash from operations before working capital changes million  partially offset by an increase in working capital million 
the decrease in cash from operations before working capital changes compared to was primarily due to non cash adjustments to net income in  including the loss recorded for pge costs million  combined with a decrease in other assets and liabilities million compared to an increase in  and a decrease in deferred gas costs million  partially offset by an adjustment to reverse the minimum pension liability recorded in million  a larger increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits million  higher net income from operations million and higher depreciation and amortization million 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest and taxes compared to a decrease in million  a decrease in inventories compared to an increase in million  a larger increase in accounts payable million and a larger decrease in other current assets and liabilities million  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable million and in accrued unbilled revenue million  in both cases compared to decreases in nw natural s refunds to customers of approximately million of deferred gas cost savings in see results of operations comparison of gas operations  above reduced cash flows from operations by that amount  but the reduction was more than offset by the other factors affecting cash flows cited above 
continuing operations provided net cash of million in compared to million in the percent increase was due to increased cash from operations before working capital changes million and lower working capital requirements million 
the increase in cash from operations before working capital changes was due to an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits in compared to a reduction in million  the loss provision for the pge transaction costs million and higher depreciation and amortization million  largely offset by a small increase in deferred gas cost payables in compared to a large swing from net gas cost receivables to payables in million  and lower net income in million 
the decrease in working capital requirements was due to an increase in accounts payable in compared to a decrease in million  a decrease in accrued unbilled revenue in compared to an increase in million  and a decrease in accounts receivable in compared to an increase in million  partially offset by a decrease in accrued interest and taxes in compared to an increase in million and a larger increase in inventories in million 
the company has lease and purchase commitments relating to its operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations see liquidity and capital resources  above  and note 
the job creation and worker assistance act of the assistance act combined with the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of the reconciliation act  allows an additional first year tax depreciation deduction on the adjusted basis of qualified property 
the assistance act provides for an additional depreciation deduction equal to percent of an asset s adjusted basis 
the reconciliation act increased this first year additional depreciation deduction to percent of an asset s adjusted basis 
the additional first year depreciation deduction is an acceleration of depreciation deductions that otherwise would have been taken in the later years of an asset s recovery period 
in general  the extra first year depreciation deduction is available for most personal property acquired after sept 
  and before sept 
 the company anticipates enhanced cash flow from reduced income taxes  totaling an estimated million to million  during the effective period  based on actual and projected plant investments between sept 
 and sept 
 investing activities cash requirements for investing activities in totaled million  up from million in cash requirements for acquisition and construction of utility plant totaled million  up from million in the increase in cash requirements for utility construction in was primarily the result of higher capital expenditures relating to nw natural s smpe project million  higher system improvements and support million and other special projects to serve new customer load or new service areas million 
cash requirements for investing activities in totaled million  down from million in  primarily due to lower amounts of cash used for investments in non utility property million and for the pge transaction million  partially offset by higher amounts of cash used for the construction of utility plant million and lower cash proceeds from the sale of assets million 
cash requirements for utility construction in totaled million  up from million in  primarily as a result of capital expenditures related to nw natural s pipeline safety program million and special projects expanding service to existing customers or into new service areas million 
investments in non utility property totaled million in both and  including expenditures in both years for certain improvements to the company s gas pipeline system that were primarily related to interstate storage services 
during the five year period through  utility construction expenditures are estimated at between million and million 
the level of capital expenditures over the next five years reflects projected customer growth  the smpe project and system improvement projects resulting in part from requirements under the pipeline safety improvement act of pipeline safety act see below 
an estimated percent of the required funds are expected to be internally generated over the five year period  the remainder will be funded through a combination of long term debt and equity securities with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
nw natural s utility capital expenditures in are estimated to total million  including million for customer growth  million for system improvement and support  million for the smpe and related gas storage projects  million for the construction of a gas distribution system in coos county  oregon and million for construction overhead 
the smpe project has a scheduled completion date in late nw natural must obtain easements and rights of way for the construction of the pipeline and may need to use condemnation proceedings to secure some of them 
nw natural entered into a stipulation with the opuc in for an enhanced pipeline safety program that includes an accelerated bare steel replacement program and a geo hazard safety program 
the bare steel replacement program accelerates the replacement of nw natural s bare steel piping over years instead of years 
the geo hazard safety program includes the identification  assessment and remediation of risks to piping infrastructure created by landslides  washouts  earthquakes or similar occurrences 
the stipulation allowed nw natural to receive deferred accounting rate treatment commencing oct 
  for costs associated with the programs exceeding million per year  expected to be approximately million annually 
in december  the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety issued a rule that specifies the detailed requirements for transmission pipeline integrity management programs imps as mandated by the pipeline safety act 
the pipeline safety act requires operators of gas transmission pipelines to identify lines located in high consequence areas hcas and to develop imps to periodically inspect the integrity of the pipelines and make repairs or replacements as necessary to ensure the ongoing integrity of the pipelines 
the legislation requires nw natural to complete inspection of the percent highest risk pipelines located in its hcas within the first five years  and the remaining covered pipelines within years of the date of the enactment 
the pipeline safety act also requires re inspections of the covered pipelines every seven years thereafter for the life of the pipelines 
the capital and operating costs of compliance with the legislation and rules  and the accounting and regulatory treatments for these costs  are uncertain 
currently  however  nw natural estimates that its imp will cost million to million in and million to million per year beginning in  totaling million to million over the next years 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash used in financing activities in of million 
factors contributing to the million difference were an increase in short term debt in million compared to a decrease in million and the redemption of the series of preference stock in million  partially offset by a higher amount used for the retirement of long term debt million in compared to million in and the redemption  including the annual sinking fund  of the series of preferred stock in million 
cash used in financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash provided by financing activities in of million 
factors contributing to the million difference were a reduction in short term debt in million compared to an increase in million  the redemption of the series of preference stock in million  and a higher amount used for the retirement of long term debt million in compared to million in  partially offset by an increase in long term debt issued million in compared to million in and a reduction in common stock repurchased million 
nw natural sold million of its secured medium term notes  series b mtns in each of and and used the proceeds to redeem long term debt million in and million in  provide cash for investments in utility plant and reduce short term borrowings 
in  nw natural commenced a program to repurchase up to million shares  or up to million in value  of nw natural s common stock through a repurchase program that has been extended through may the purchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
no shares were repurchased in or in since the program s inception the company has repurchased  shares of common stock at a total cost of million 
pension cost income and funding status net periodic pension cost is determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions  above 
the annual pension cost or income is allocated between operations and maintenance expense and construction overhead 
net periodic pension cost for the company s qualified defined benefit pension plans was million in  compared to net pension income of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in pension cost was largely due to investment losses in and  which are recognized over a three year period  and to lower discount rates which had the effect of increasing accumulated benefit obligations 
the company is required to make a cash contribution of at least million  and may make an additional contribution up to a total of million  to its non bargaining employee pension plan for the plan year  payable by sept 
 no cash contributions to the qualified plans were required for the or plan years 
the fair value of the plan assets increased to million at dec 
  from million at dec 
  including million in investment gains  partially offset by million in withdrawals to pay benefits and million in eligible expenses of the plans 
the present value of benefit obligations under the plans increased from an estimated million to million over that period  however  so the plans remained under funded by about million at dec 
 despite the decline from a position of pension income in and to a position of pension expense in  and the reductions in recent years in the funded status of the plans  nw natural believes it will be able to maintain well funded pension plans 
nw natural does not expect its current or future cash contributions to the plans to have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended dec 
  and  the company s ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges  and fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  dividends on all preferred and preference stock  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income 
contingent liabilities environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe to control environmental impacts 
the company believes  at this time  that appropriate investigation or remediation is being undertaken at all the relevant sites 
based on existing knowledge  the company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

historically  nw natural has taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in its natural gas purchase contracts 
the contracts are subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs in comparison with established benchmark costs  except that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
at dec 
  differences between notional values and fair values with respect to nw natural s open positions in derivative financial instruments were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations because of the treatment of these instruments in regulatory mechanisms relating to gas costs see results of operations comparison of gas operations cost of gas  above  and notes and
