item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hibbett is a rapidly growing operator of full line sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets predominantly in the southeast  mid atlantic and midwest 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
our merchandise assortment features a broad selection of brand name merchandise emphasizing team sports and fitness complemented by a selection of localized apparel and accessories designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market 
we believe our stores are among the primary retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to penetrate our target markets 
as of january  we operated hibbett sports stores as well as smaller format sports additions athletic shoe stores and four larger format sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located in enclosed malls and dominant strip centers which are generally the center of commerce within the area and which are generally anchored by a wal mart store 
we target markets with county populations that range from  to  by targeting smaller markets  we believe we achieve significant strategic advantages  including numerous expansion opportunities  comparatively low operating costs and a more limited competitive environment than generally faced in larger markets 
in addition  we establish greater customer and vendor recognition as the leading full line sporting goods retailer in these local communities 
although competitors in some markets may carry similar product lines and national brands  we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary  full line sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of traditional team and individual sports merchandise offered and a high level of customer service 
in fiscal  we began to accelerate our rate of new store openings to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our target markets 
since fiscal  we have grown our store base from to stores 
our expansion strategy is to continue to open hibbett sports stores in our target markets 
we plan to open approximately hibbett sports stores  net of store closings  in fiscal we do not expect that the average size of our stores opened in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal hibbett historically has comparable store sales in the low to mid single digit range and we plan to increase total square footage by approximately in fiscal year we believe total sales percentage growth will be in the mid teens in fiscal over the past three years  we have increased our product margin due to improved vendor discounts  increased efficiencies in logistics and favorable leveraging of our store occupancy costs 
we expect gross profit to increase to basis points in fiscal due to our increased sales  we have leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses and offset recent increases in certain expenses including property  casualty and medical insurance 
with our expected sales increase  we plan to leverage expenses to basis points in fiscal we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base and provide capital expenditures for both warehouse and information projects while increasing our cash position 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended january   february  and february   include weeks of operations 
hibbett has been incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware since october  results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended january  february  february  net sales cost of goods sold  including warehouse  distribution  and store occupancy costs gross profit store operating  selling  and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  for the weeks ended january  as compared to the same week period in the prior year 
this increase is attributed to the opening of hibbett sports stores and sports additions stores  net of store closings  in the week period ended january   and a increase in comparable store net sales for the week period ended january  the increase in comparable store net sales was primarily due to increased sales in apparel 
apparel sales  mainly college and pro licensed products and active wear  were driven by retro nba and nfl jerseys  under armour and nike dri fit performance wear  women s active wear and college apparel and cheerleading shorts 
basketball  new balance running shoes  nike shox  kswiss athletic shoes and the retro classic look drove footwear sales 
equipment sales were down from last year s numbers  primarily due to category elimination in racket sports  golf and in line skates 
our team sports business  which consists of baseball  basketball  football and soccer  improved during the fourth quarter  but did not offset the decreases from the eliminated categories and the softness in the fitness category 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales  and increases in comparable store net sales contributed million 
comparable store net sales data for the year reflect sales for our hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
during the week period ended january   we opened hibbett sports stores and sports additions and closed stores 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
the improved gross margin is primarily attributed to selling more merchandise at full price  the leveraging of occupancy and warehouse cost and improved logistics flow 
product margin improved basis points due to gains in initial mark on  a reduction in mark down rate and improvements in shrinkage 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to above average comparable store sales gains 
warehouse costs improved by basis points  primarily due to the leveraging of salaries and benefits 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the week period ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the comparable period a year ago 
net of the sale on a leasehold interest in fiscal  store operating  selling and administrative expenses were of net sales versus for the same adjusted period last year 
the decrease in store operating  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the weeks ended january   was attributed to the leveraging of store labor and other store related non payroll expenses 
retail store labor decreased as a percent of net sales by basis points this period compared with the same week period last year due to higher than expected comparable store sales and improved labor controls 
store supplies were down basis points year over year and net advertising costs were reduced by basis points this year compared to the same week period last year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended february  the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales is due to an increase in sales this year compared to the same week period last year and an increase in landlord contributions on leasehold improvements 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended february   due to a basis point increase in pre tax income 
the income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or for the weeks ended february  compared to the same week period in the prior year 
this increase is attributed to the opening of hibbett sports stores  net of store closings  in the week period ended february   and a increase in comparable store net sales for the week period ended february  the increase in comparable store net sales was primarily due to increased sales in apparel and footwear 
apparel sales  mainly college and pro licensed products and active wear  were driven by strong consumer demand for retro pro licensed jerseys  caps and jackets  hooded fleece and moisture wicking performance products 
nike basketball shoes  new balance running shoes  k swiss athletic shoes and the retro and classic look drove footwear sales 
equipment sales were down from last year s numbers due to the industry s inability to produce new high volume fitness items  such as the highly advertised ab roller from previous years 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales  and increases in comparable store net sales contributed million 
comparable store net sales data for the year reflect sales for our hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
during the week period ended february   we opened hibbett sports stores and closed gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
the improved gross margin is primarily attributed to a reduction in freight expense of  this period compared with the same period last year  a decrease as a percent of net sales of basis points  a reduction in warehouse labor related expenses as a percent of net sales of basis points this year compared with last year and a reduction in store occupancy costs as a percent of net sales of basis points this period compared with the same period last year 
the reduction in freight expense is a result of an increase in direct container shipments  an increase in backhauls and an increased percentage of full trailer loads 
the reduction in warehouse labor related expenses is due to lower inventory levels per store and less handling of merchandise in the warehouse through increased cross docking 
the reduction in store occupancy related costs as a percentage of net sales is a result of leveraging common area maintenance expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in inventory shortages on a year over year basis due to better than expected performance in the prior year 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the week period ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  for the comparable period a year ago 
net of the sale on a leasehold interest  store operating  selling and administrative expenses were of net sales versus for the same period last year

retail store labor decreased as a percent of net sales by basis points during this period compared with the same week period last year due to higher than expected comparable store sales and improved labor controls 
the improvements in store labor and other related non payroll expenses were somewhat offset by an increase in insurance costs post september  property and casualty insurance costs increased by  year over year  a difference as a percent of net sales of basis points 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   and in the weeks ended february  the increase as a percent to sales is primarily attributed to a  or increase  in depreciation of shorter lived assets  such as point of sale software 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   compared to for the weeks ended february   due to a basis point increase in pre tax income 
the income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal compared to for fiscal due to lower state tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  february  february  net cash provided by operating activities    cash flows provided by used in investing activities capital expenditures    proceeds from sales of property and equipment net cash used in investing activities    cash flows provided by used in financing activities revolving loan borrowings and repayments  net   proceeds from options exercised and purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net cash provided by operating activities has historically been driven by net income levels combined with fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable balances 
net income has increased in each of the last three fiscal years 
in addition  we have continued to increase our inventory levels throughout these periods as the number of stores has increased 
however  inventory levels on a per store basis have decreased 
we financed this increase in total inventory primarily through cash generated from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
these activities resulted in cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
with respect to cash flows from investing activities  capital expenditures for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures for the week period ended january   were primarily related to the opening of new hibbett sports stores and new sports additions stores  the refurbishing of existing stores and purchasing corporate assets  including automobiles and warehouse equipment 
we estimate capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  which relate to the opening of approximately hibbett sports stores exclusive of store closings  remodeling of selected existing stores and improvements at the company s headquarters and distribution center 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities have historically represented financing of our long term growth 
in fiscal  we received million  excluding the related tax benefit  from proceeds related to stock options exercised and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
we negotiated a new unsecured revolving credit facility that allows borrowings up to million and which will expire november   subject to renewal every two years 
in fiscal  the unsecured revolving credit facility allowed borrowings up to million and we also maintained an unsecured working capital line of credit for million  which expired on january  and was not renewed 
as of january  and february   we had no debt outstanding under any of these facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans  management believes we can adequately fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new credit facility 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sporting goods  inc at january  in millions payments due under contractual obligations f f f f f thereafter total long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases        see long term debt financial statement note see leases financial statement note inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control 
national or international events  including the war on terrorism  could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where a significant portion of our merchandise is manufactured 
these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations 
consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures 
merchandise costs 
based on current economic conditions  we expect that merchandise costs per unit will remain constant in fiscal freight costs 
because of rising fuel costs  we could experience increases in freight costs 
however  we do not expect these increases  if any  to have a material effect on our results of operations 
minimum wage 
an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs 
in prior years  proposals increasing the federal minimum wage by per hour have narrowly failed to pass both houses of congress 
insurance costs 
during fiscal  property  casualty and health insurance costs increased significantly 
we expect that these costs will increase in fiscal  but the increase will not be as significant as it was in the prior year 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie 
we do not expect interpretation or fin r to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued exposure draft  share based payment 
in this statement  the fasb formally proposed to require companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to employees for future reporting periods 
it is probable that the company will be required to expense options under its current plan in future periods under this exposure draft 
however  the company cannot estimate the impact that expensing options will have on the final statements until the fasb completes its exposure draft process and issues its final statement 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for the company  the statement was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for the company on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
the company currently does not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
all retail merchandise sales occur on site in the company s retail stores and the customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on layaway 
the customer may make further payments in installments  but the entire purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by hibbett within days 
hibbett records the down payment and any installments as deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the merchandise and takes possession of such merchandise 
hibbett recognizes merchandise revenues at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
the cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized by hibbett 
proceeds received from the issuance of gift cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and such proceeds are subsequently recognized as revenue at the time the customer redeems such gift cards and takes possession of the merchandise 
inventory valuation 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method 
in using this method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory valuation method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may  under certain circumstances  result in inaccurate cost figures 
inaccurate inventory cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory to a group of products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and turnover 
we accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger 
store counts are performed on a cyclical basis and the distribution center counts are performed at the end of december or in early january every year 
management believes that the application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business  and therefore  do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
any future decision to declare or pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors  as the board of directors deems relevant 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our net sales and operating income are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales increases during the holiday selling season 
however  the seasonal fluctuations are mitigated by the strong product demand in the spring and back to school sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores  the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  merchandise mix  the relative proportion of stores represented by each of our three store concepts and demand for apparel and accessories driven by local interest in sporting events

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to market risk from interest rate fluctuations on our revolving credit facility and working capital line of credit  each of which bears interest at rates that vary with libor  prime or quoted cost of funds rates
