item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we provide infrastructure  systems and services  as well as innovative solutions for telecommunications providers and public safety organizations 
our core business is the support of the nation s emergency response infrastructure for wireline  wireless and voip networks 
the data we manage enables a call to be routed to the appropriate psap 
we provide callback data and the caller s location 
this critical information helps public safety organizations respond to calls for assistance 
in addition  this data allows the telecommunications carriers to meet state and federal regulatory mandates 
since we launched our data management services in  our data integrity infrastructure has provided virtually uninterrupted service to our telecommunications and public safety customers 
our customers include ixcs  ilecs  clecs  wireless carriers and a wide variety of state  local and federal government agencies 
effective january   we realigned our internal operating units by aggregating similar offerings with organizational supervision and decision making authorities 
as a result  we have three business units wireline  wireless and new markets 
our revenue is derived from monthly data management services  ongoing software and hardware maintenance  software enhancements  sales of new products and systems and professional services 
beginning in  revenue and direct costs have been classified in the consolidated statements of operations by these three business units 
prior to  we classified revenue and direct costs on a total company basis 
the change has not impacted our revenue recognition policies 
as a result of this change  revenue and direct costs for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation 
this change had no effect on our financial position  total revenue  total direct costs  net income loss or cash flows for any of the periods presented 
the revenue derived from monthly data management services and ongoing maintenance of existing systems accounts for the majority of our revenue 
we consider this recurring revenue as it is derived from long term contracts with terms of up to years 
in  recurring revenue comprised million  or  of our total revenue of million 
in  recurring revenue accounted for million  or  of our million in total revenue 
in  recurring revenue represented million  or  of our total revenue of million 
the following is a summary level discussion of key business drivers in our segments 
a more detailed discussion is contained in the analysis of the results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources section 
the following table represents total revenue amounts in thousands and percentages by business unit year ended december  revenue percentage business unit wireline    wireless    new markets   total    the following table represents total operating income loss amounts in thousands and percentages by business unit year ended december  operating income loss percentage business unit wireline    wireless   new markets    total    as our revenue has grown  we have achieved significant operating expense leverage  translating to increased profitability 
we have made additional investments in facilities  personnel and infrastructure to support new market and product opportunities 
we have also reallocated resources when necessary to support our initiatives 
our overall corporate headcount has remained at approximately employees as our revenue has grown in  and executive summary wireline the majority of our recurring revenue has been derived from our wireline segment 
we generally enjoy long term contractual relationships with our customers over terms up to years 
our revenue model in wireline is built on the basis of recurring fees and the number of records we either manage or support indirectly through licensing agreements 
we face limited competition in this segment 
the primary competitive risk we face is the possibility that our customers may decide to no longer outsource this service to us 
although we have long term contracts  our customers could decide to either not renew contracts or to cancel them prior to the end date and decide to bring the services in house 
our non recurring revenue for systems sales  software enhancements and sales of new products and services is dependent upon many factors including length of sales cycles  market acceptance and product viability 
due to these uncertainties and the continued fiscal constraints certain customers continue to operate under  the frequency and magnitude of this revenue can be difficult to predict 
we also face internal execution risk to identify  build and gain market and customer acceptance for these product and service offerings 
despite this uncertainty  our visibility into the recurring nature of our revenue streams and our ability to execute on the non recurring sales has provided the financial foundation for us to execute on our strategies 
we expect contributions from the wireline segment to continue to provide the majority of our forecasted revenue  operating income and operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
wireless revenue contribution in our wireless segment has continued to grow 
we have contractual relationships to provide e services for of the top wireless carriers in the united states  representing what we estimate to be approximately of all addressable wireless numbers in the united states 
we are executing strategies to deploy our services to the remaining contracted addressable market in a prudent fiscal and operational manner 
we believe our ability to successfully deploy our services to the remaining addressable market under contract will provide additional recurring revenue into the future  absent customer cancellations of our contracts  loss of market share to our competitors or material price erosion with existing customers 
competition in the wireless segment for our services is much more prevalent than in our wireline segment 
we recognize one primary competitor  telecommunications systems inc the competitive pressures we face create pricing and execution risk to our existing business 
however  we believe we are well positioned to compete with telecommunications systems not only to retain our existing customer base but to acquire additional market share 
contracts in our wireless segment are typically three years in length 
given the uncertainty that exists in the wireless segment as a result of potential mergers and consolidations  it is difficult to predict the long term viability of our core products and services 
in  and  wireline and wireless represented at least of our existing revenue base and four customers accounted for of our revenue 
it is our goal to expand our product and customer portfolio beyond our traditional offerings in the wireline and wireless segments 
as our customers look to us to provide fcc mandated phase i and phase ii e services in their networks  we are also expanding our product offerings to build on previously deployed technologies 
revenue contributions have increased from the sales of these other service offerings  including sales of enhanced emergency services  or ees  position determining entity  or pde  and automated crash notification  or acn  software  integration and implementation services and project management 
on february   we completed our acquisition of bmd wireless to expand our product offerings outside of the united states 
bmd wireless provides core network messaging solutions  enabling cross network mobile and application messaging traffic for a wide range of mobile operators and service providers 
bmd wireless will focus primarily on designing  building and delivering messaging platforms  tools and solutions for wireless service providers 
bmd s product offerings include the following wireless application messaging server  which enables global sms access to applications and services  personal call collector  which captures attempted or missed calls when a mobile user is out of coverage  not reachable or when no voice mail is left  and sms spam filtering  which offers functionality to block unsolicited sms messages from on net or off net sources 
we believe that our historical ability to deliver profitable products and service offerings can be leveraged to new markets and new products outside of traditional services and markets in which we continue to compete successfully 
new markets in our new markets segment  we are pursuing revenue and customer diversification efforts outside of new product and service initiatives in the wireline and wireless segments 
the current new market revenue streams are derived from intellicast sm and commercial database services 
market dynamics in our new markets segment present unique challenges and competitive pressures beyond those we have traditionally faced 
we believe the viability for our products exists  as evidenced by our existing customer base and recent customer wins 
however  the lengthened sales cycles and customer buying patterns  especially with the intellicast sm offering have been longer than we expected 
intellicast sm we are pursuing intellicast sm sales at the federal  state and local government level 
our success to date in intellicast sm has been primarily at the city and county government level 
as of december   we had million billable telephone numbers in our database 
in  we won contracts with chicago  new orleans  phoenix and several other municipalities 
these recent wins in large markets added to our existing contracts with denver and houston 
we need to increase the number of telephone numbers under contract to achieve profitability in this market 
if this occurs  we expect to continue to leverage our existing operating expenses 
we currently have channel sales agreements with two major ilecs to jointly promote our products 
we intend to increase our sales efforts at the federal government level and we are pursuing opportunities with agencies such as federal emergency management agency  national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the department of homeland security 
we have also partnered with the national center for missing and exploited children to promote our product offerings and to gain access to decision makers at the federal  state and local government levels 
current revenues are generated from ongoing data management services and event launches  such as the delivery of voice and tdd telephonic warnings and customer buying patterns about potential disasters and public safety issues to geographically targeted populations 
our products and services are assisting law enforcement and public safety officials to protect lives  prevent injuries  recover abducted children  capture suspected criminals and help mitigate property damages 
the successes with the product have provided momentum to our sales efforts 
however  sales cycles in intellicast sm are much longer than our traditional cycles and have proven to be more difficult to predict 
this is based in large part to customer buying patterns and available funding 
we believe recent legislation such as the burns clinton bill will provide a potential impetus to matching and direct governmental funding that could reduce the sales cycles among our target customers 
commercial database we believe there are opportunities for us to leverage our long term customer relationships with our existing customers to gain entry and traction in the commercial database markets 
our commercial database product offering is primarily transactional in nature 
we believe market acceptance and product viability exists  as evidenced by our contractual wins in with at t and vartec 
we have successfully signed input provider agreements allowing us to populate the database with approximately of available clec data 
we are pursuing opportunities with other data input providers  which could increase this percentage to approximately of clec data 
we believe this to be a critical milestone to enhance our product viability and to ensure transactional data revenue going forward 
as long distance providers continue to struggle with revenue assurance and revenue leakage  we believe there will be a market for our product 
we continue to remain patient in our pursuit of both the intellicast sm and commercial database market opportunities 
we continue to invest in product enhancements in both markets 
however  if sales conditions do not improve  we will adjust our spending patterns accordingly to mitigate the impact of such conditions on our overall profitability 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
while preparing these financial statements  we made estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  intangible assets  capitalized software costs  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition amortization periods on remaining deferred revenue and cost balances as of december   we had approximately million in deferred revenue and million in deferred costs 
of these amounts  million of the deferred revenue balance and million of the deferred cost balance was classified as short term 
the majority of these balances relate to services previously provided to wireless customers and require deferral under staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab  since we have remaining service obligations 
it has been our policy to amortize these balances over the remaining future service periods  which has historically been the remaining contractual life 
in most cases  we engage in renewal strategies well before the end of the contract 
however  we cannot estimate with any certainty which contracts will be extended and for how long 
this is especially relevant in the wireless segment  based on uncertainty that exists within the industry due to potential consolidation of carriers and the financial decisions our customers have made in the past or may make in the future related to utilizing our service offerings 
therefore  we have not extended the amortization periods for the remaining balances beyond the existing contractual life 
as there can be no assurances that the contracts will be extended  or  if extended  for what period of time  we continue to believe that the best estimate of the customer relationship period is the existing contractual life 
use of estimates and judgment related to recognizing revenue for percentage of completion and multiple element arrangements the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contracts with our customers and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as products and services are provided 
in certain situations  we also recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis  as prescribed by statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop in these situations  we develop and utilize estimates to ratably recognize costs and revenue as work is completed relative to the total estimated time and costs to complete projects 
delays in completing projects and or significant changes to original cost estimates could adversely impact future periods in that additional costs or amortization periods for both revenue and expenses may be necessary 
we also deliver products and services that are part of multiple element arrangements 
utilizing the criteria from sab and statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  we also rely upon the guidance in emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires us to evaluate vendor specific objective evidence for contracts under sop and vendor objective evidence for contracts under sab to determine the fair value of elements delivered in situations where multiple element arrangements exist 
software capitalization as of december   we had million in net capitalized software assets 
capitalization of software under sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  requires judgment in determining when and if a project is in the application development stage  when the software is available for general release and its intended use  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product  and the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
capitalization of software under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires judgment in determining when and if a project has reached technological feasibility  when the software is available for general release  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product  and the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
in assessing the recoverability of our existing capitalized software assets  we rely on estimates and judgments to determine the net realizable value of each product 
when evaluating the net realizable value of a given product  we prepare a forward looking business case that includes an assessment of future expected benefits to be derived from the asset 
the expected benefits are compared to the direct costs associated with the delivery and ongoing support of the product to arrive at a contribution margin  defined as expected benefits less direct costs 
this contribution margin is compared to the current carrying value of the asset at the reporting date 
if the contribution margin exceeds the current asset carrying value plus any additional investments  such as hardware or additional development required to enhance or maintain the product  no impairment is recorded 
if the contribution margin is less than the carrying value  the asset carrying value is impaired to equal the expected contribution margin 
our ability to estimate future expected benefits to be derived from the asset  with a measured degree of probability is the most significant factor in our impairment analysis 
if our ability to estimate the expected benefits changes significantly in any given period  we could record impairment charges for certain assets 
each quarter  we also assess the expected benefit period of the assets and amortize the related assets over the expected benefit period 
if our estimate of benefit period is impacted  we could adjust our estimated amortization periods accordingly  having either a positive or negative impact on earnings in the period the estimate is changed 
goodwill and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles or long lived assets  including property and equipment and goodwill  annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare the result to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
there were no impairment losses in  or in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  became effective and  as a result  we no longer amortize approximately million in net goodwill 
our annual impairment reviews for and supported the carrying value of goodwill at december  and  respectively 
allowances we maintain allowances and reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for credit memos which may be granted to customers in future periods that relate to revenue recognized in current periods 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or concessions or discounts are granted in future periods which exceed our estimates  additional allowances and reserves may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  down from  at december  and the reserve for credit memos was  down from  at december  the decreases are primarily attributable to improved collection activity 
deterioration in the financial condition of our current customers may cause our allowance for doubtful accounts to increase and our future operating results to be adversely affected 
in the normal course of our business  we may be involved in billing disputes with certain customers 
the resolution of these disputes may result in the granting of credit memos to the customer 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for potential bad debts and credit memos at december  deferred tax assets we believe that  based on all available evidence  it continues to be more likely than not that net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
the majority of the deferred income taxes relate to available net operating loss  or nol  and research and development credit carryforwards 
there is no assurance that we will generate the expected taxable income projected in making this determination or that all of our nol carryforwards will be utilized in the manner we expect 
as additional evidence becomes available  we will continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
we currently do not have a reserve against our net deferred tax asset 
if expected taxable income is not generated in future years  it may be necessary to reverse some or all of the tax benefit recorded  adversely impacting tax expense and net income in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued sab as an update to sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements and to rescind the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers faq issued with sab selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab the application of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas  to address the classification of certain financial instruments embodying obligations that could be settled by the issuance of an entity s own shares 
sfas improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity and requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities or assets in certain circumstances in statements of financial position 
sfas is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
the adoption of fin has not had  nor do we believe it will have  a material impact on our current or prospective consolidated financial statements 
in november  fasb issued fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statement nos 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin fin requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or issue issue provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of issue apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of issue has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

wireline revenues increased million to million in recurring data management services revenues increased  maintenance for software enhancements increased million related to additional maintenance on software enhancements  sales of new software enhancements and systems decreased  due to timing differences between year end and as it relates to delivery of software enhancements  and professional services revenues increased  primarily due to voip services 
wireless revenues increased million to million in recurring data management services revenues increased million due to increased deployments  and professional services and software enhancement revenues increased million primarily due to additional services and enhancements related to our pde and ees offerings 
new markets revenues increased by  to million in intellicast sm revenues increased  to million due to deployments in chicago  phoenix  new orleans and other municipalities  and commercial database revenues increased  to  due to new contracts with at t and vartec 
costs total costs increased million to million in the significant areas where costs increased from include salaries and fringe expense consisting of payroll taxes  accrued vacation  costs to provide medical coverage  k employer match  etc 
increased million due to annual merit increases  increased health insurance costs  the hiring of additional staff to replace consultants and modifications of certain commission plans from variable to fixed 
amortization of capitalized software assets increased million primarily due to the amortization expense for larger capitalized software projects such as nrlldb  intellicast sm im and mpc 
a million decrease in the amount of expenditures capitalized for software development  primarily due to several larger projects that were completed in  such as nrlldb  intellicast and mpc 
depreciation expenses increased by million primarily due to the depreciation of leasehold improvements for our new corporate facility and depreciation on new fixed assets purchased for infrastructure projects to support new products and services 
maintenance and direct costs for cost of goods sold increased by million due to increased sales to palladium innovations customers and incremental costs associated with additional software licenses 
telecommunications expenses increased by  due to additional circuit costs associated with new products and services and the increase in the deployed subscriber base in wireless 
external legal fees increased by  primarily due to costs related to the state of texas contract dispute and other legal matters 
employee training  recruiting and relocation expenses increased by  due to additional management and employee training programs and the recruitment of additional personnel to support growth initiatives 
the significant areas where costs decreased from include inventory impairment expenses decreased by million in consulting expenses decreased by million primarily due to the replacement of contractors with full time employees and to the decreased need for services related to capitalized software projects 
this partially offsets the million increase noted above in salary and fringe expenses 
commission expenses decreased by million primarily due to modification of certain commission plans from variable to fixed 
this also partially offsets the increase in salary and fringe expenses noted above 
bad debt expenses decreased by  due to fewer clec bankruptcies  most notably mci formerly worldcom  inc  translating to lower bad debt allowance reserves 
vacation expenses decreased by  due to lower accrual of vacation balances in compared to bonus expenses decreased by  primarily due to lower management bonuses and retention bonuses which were paid to lpss employees in travel expenses decreased by  due to the hiring of additional satellite sales personnel  which decreased overnight travel and cost savings from vendors 
income before income taxes income before income taxes increased million to million in wireline income before taxes increased million wireless income before taxes increased million new markets loss before taxes increased million 
income tax expense benefit there was income tax expense of million in versus a tax benefit of million in the tax benefit in was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
in december  we also recorded a  benefit to income tax expense 
based on our actual pre tax income for the year ended december   our full year effective tax rate was  requiring us to reverse tax expense that was previously recorded in the first nine months of utilizing the higher estimated tax rate of 
in  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 
balance sheet items current assets increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily a result of the following factors cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in the increase is attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of million  offset by net cash used in investing activities of million and net cash used in financing activities of million 
deferred contract costs short term increased million to million in  primarily due to a proportional increase in the amount of deferred revenue that was considered short term 
deferred income taxes short term increased million to million in we estimate that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset taxable income in the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue  from million in to million in this decrease is attributable to improvements in collections and days sales outstanding  which decreased from days at december  to days at december   and a million reduction in unbilled revenue due to an administrative billing error at year end which caused a large amount of billings to be distributed in january as opposed to december the non current assets decreased by  primarily due to the following goodwill increased million to million in  due to a million increase in the consideration owed to lucent for the lpss acquisition 
software development costs increased million to million in this increase is primarily due to investments in several significant projects that reached technological feasibility during  offset by current year amortization expense 
deferred income taxes long term of million at december  was reclassified to short term at december  due to the estimate that it would be realized in the near term 
property  plant and equipment  net decreased by million due primarily to current year depreciation expense 
other intangibles  net decreased by million due to current year amortization expense 
current liabilities increased million to million in primarily as a result of the following factors accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million in  as a result of increased purchasing activity during and timing differences in the payment of obligations accrued at year end 
notes payable current increased million to million in the increase reflects the amount due in the next year on a new secured term loan entered into with ge capital in may offset by partial repayment of our line of credit 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock payable of million was recorded for the additional consideration owed to complete the lpss acquisition during the first and second quarters of deferred contract revenue short term increased million to million in  primarily due to the reclassification of deferred revenue from long term liabilities due to the estimated realization of these revenues in the next year and realization of current year revenue earned 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the vacation accrual due to usage in and the payment of million to lucent in as the final payment for inventory acquired in the lpss acquisition 
long term liabilities decreased million to million in this decrease is primarily a result of the following factors line of credit decreased million to million in the company used its positive cash flow and a portion of the proceeds from a new secured term loan with ge capital in may to pay down the line of credit to the minimum required borrowing level 
deferred contract revenue long term decreased million to million in  primarily due to its reclassification to a current liability  partially offset by deferral of revenues for new contracts in the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in notes payable long term as the result of a new secured term loan entered into with ge capital in may results of operations by business unit year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations by business segment reflected as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  wireline wireless new markets total revenue direct costs indirect business unit costs corporate overhead total costs and expenses income loss from operations net interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss wireline business unit revenue increased by million to million in primarily due to recurring data management services revenue increased  maintenance for software enhancements increased million related to additional maintenance on software enhancements  sales of new software enhancements and systems decreased  due to timing differences between year end and as it relates to delivery of software enhancements  and professional services revenues increased  primarily due to voip services and other projects in clec 
direct costs were leveraged in relation to new revenues of million  increasing by only  we were able to leverage direct costs due to expense savings as a result of consolidation of administrative and management functions and an increase in productivity in key operating units 
the savings realized were partially offset by increased costs to support the additional maintenance revenue stream 
indirect expenses  which include sales and marketing  general and administrative  research and development and allocated corporate overhead expenses  decreased million to million in this decrease is due to savings realized as a result of a reorganization of general and administrative support personnel which occurred in the fourth quarter of we also realized savings in salary and consulting expenses as a result of a reorganization in our sales and product management teams 
in  we also had higher bad debt expenses due to the accrual for potential bad debt write offs for certain clec customers  most notably mci formerly known as worldcom  inc which did not occur at the same level in wireless business unit revenue increased by million to million in due to an increase in cell site deployments and sales of enhancements for new and existing products  such as ees and pde 
direct costs increased by million to million in costs increased due to the hiring of additional operations staff to support cell site implementations and increased systems maintenance and circuit costs to accommodate growth 
direct costs decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue  from to  primarily due to economies of scale associated with the increase in cell sites under management and the resulting increased revenue base 
indirect expenses  which include sales and marketing  general and administrative  research and development and allocated corporate overhead expenses  increased by million to million in the increase in expense is due to the addition of product management  sales personnel and finance personnel needed to accommodate growth 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue  from to  is primarily due to economies of scale associated with the revenue increase 
new markets business unit revenue increased  to million  primarily due to increases in records under intellicast sm management and an increase in sales by the commercial database group 
direct costs increased by million to million in the million increase due to data acquisition costs  increases in operational personnel expenses and amortization of the software development costs to build the intellicast sm and intellibase sm nrlldb product offerings 
indirect business unit expenses  which include sales and marketing  general and administrative  research and development and allocated corporate overhead expenses  increased by million to million in the increase in indirect business unit costs is due to the addition of sales and support personnel  as well as increased marketing and advertising costs for intellicast sm and intellibase sm nrlldb product offerings 
corporate overhead corporate overhead  consisting of expenses incurred by various corporate support units  decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily due to a million asset impairment charge in that did not occur in  offset by increases in general and administrative costs due to the increased payroll  benefit  insurance and legal costs as outlined earlier 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total company revenues total revenues increased million from million in to million in the increase is attributable to increased sequential revenue performance in each of the three business units 
wireline revenues increased by million  from million in to million in approximately million of this increase is attributable to the may lpss acquisition 
we generated seven months of lpss related revenue in  as compared to months in the balance is attributable to sales of new product offerings  additional software licensing and the sale of network enhancements to existing customers to our ilec customers 
we also grew our revenue from clec customers by million primarily due to an increase in number of subscribers 
wireless revenues increased by million  from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in cell site deployments and sales of enhancements for new and existing products 
new markets revenues increased  due to sales of the new intellibase sm nrlldb services as well as growth in our new intellicast sm product 
costs total costs increased million from million in to million in  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the significant areas where costs increased from are million of expenses related to the full year impact of integrating the lpss operation  of which million represented direct operating costs  such as salaries  retention bonuses and maintenance expenses for subcontracted services provided by third party vendors  offset by a  reduction in goodwill amortization due to implementation of sfas in a million asset impairment charge in due to the write off of inventory acquired from lucent 
million in direct costs associated with headcount and other operating expenses for the delivery of services to our increased subscriber base 
million of additional sales and marketing expense related to new product promotions  increased sales and support personnel and incremental public relations charges to support product offerings 
a million increase in general and administrative costs related to additional infrastructure and support personnel costs  including increased rent and depreciation expenses related to our expanded headquarters facility in longmont  colorado 
the significant area where costs decreased from a million reduction in research and development costs  which is attributable to the number of projects that reached technological feasibility during and thus subsequent development costs were recorded as capitalized software 
income loss before income taxes income before taxes increased million  from a loss of million in to income of million in wireline income before taxes increased million wireless loss before taxes decreased million new markets loss before taxes increased million 
income tax benefit the tax benefit in was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
results of operations by business unit year ended december  compared to year ended december  wireline business unit revenue increased from million in to million in approximately million of this increase is attributable to the may lpss acquisition 
we generated seven months of lpss related revenue in  as compared to months in the balance of the increase is attributable to the sale of new product offerings  additional software licensing and network enhancements to existing ilec customers  along with an increase in the number of clec subscribers served from million in to million in and the acceleration of previously deferred revenue  relating to setup and nre fees for certain clec customers that filed chapter and ceased operations in direct costs increased to million in costs increased by million due to the addition of staff in conjunction with the lpss acquisition  increased maintenance expenses related to lpss s database division  along with the addition of support personnel to accommodate sales growth from existing customers 
indirect expenses  which include sales and marketing  general and administrative  research and development and allocated corporate overhead expenses  increased million to million in approximately  of the increase was due to the addition of new employees in conjunction with the lpss acquisition  increased headcount and managerial costs  as well as increased bad debt expense associated with bankruptcy filings for certain customers  most notably mci formerly known as worldcom  inc 
wireless business unit revenue increased million to million in due to an increase in cell site deployments and sales of enhancements for new and existing products 
direct costs increased million to million in costs increased due to the hiring of additional operations staff to support cell site implementations and increased systems maintenance and circuit costs to accommodate growth

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements the following information summarizes  as of the last fiscal year end and balance sheet date  our known significant contractual obligations  which are comprised of our operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations  term loans  line of credit and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock payable in thousands december  thereafter total operating leases      capital leases  gross   term loans     line of credit   mandatorily redeemable preferred stock payable  gross   total commitments      in addition to our contractual obligations  we estimate that we will require cash to complete the acquisition of bmd wireless in february at a cash cost of approximately million  continue to fund ongoing operations  including the addition of sales and product development personnel  complete existing product strategies  including our intellicast sm  commercial database and other major wireline and wireless product initiatives  complete market penetration strategies  invest in new product development  complete leasehold improvements to our existing facilities  invest in additional hardware and software to maintain and enhance our existing networks and software applications to achieve efficiencies  increase research and development efforts to design and implement nextgen platforms to support future technological requirements our nextgen emergency services network esn initiative is focused on designing and delivering the next generation of emergency communications services and is a key element of our strategy to enhance our existing services business  begin paying federal and state income taxes once available tax assets and credits are fully utilized  and comply with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in  we estimate that we will spend approximately million related to capitalized software projects and to million for capital expenditures to support the above initiatives 
we will also require million in june to make the second of three payments related to our earn out obligation to nvp ii 
we also anticipate that we will begin payment of federal income taxes in the second half of this will be incremental to prior periods  as we have previously utilized available tax credits and assets to mitigate payment of income taxes on previously generated taxable income 
we expect to fund our capital obligations and ongoing operational activities and income taxes from cash provided by operations and existing cash balances at december  of million 
we cannot predict with certainty the cash requirements for our proposed strategies and ongoing operational requirements  as technological requirements for new product strategies  contemplated market conditions  competitive pressure and customer requirements change rapidly 
if we are unable to generate the cash from operations at a level we currently estimate  our efforts to complete existing products  complete the acquisition of bmd wireless  enhance our platforms and enter new markets could be adversely impacted 
we estimate that we will enter into additional capital leases in to finance major hardware and software purchases at a level commensurate with past years 
we may also require cash to complete acquisitions in addition to our acquisition of bmd wireless 
at present  we have no binding commitments with any third parties to obtain any material amount of equity or debt financing other than the equity and debt financing arrangements described in this report 
however  if business opportunities arise in the future  we may enter into discussions regarding potential equity and debt financing arrangements to satisfy actual or anticipated capital needs 
in  we expanded our revolving line of credit with ge capital from to million 
we also entered into a second term loan for million to refinance the then outstanding principal balance on our revolving line of credit and fund continued operations 
these financings were done to provide additional flexibility and capacity to meet our short and long term needs and to lower our interest rate 
the expansion of our revolving credit facility and the million term loan also lowered the interest rate on outstanding principal from a fixed rate of prime plus  which was at december   to a floating libor based rate  which was at december   and extended the due date on outstanding principal on the revolver from july to december sources and uses of cash operating activities the following summarizes our cash provided by operating activities million million million our ability to generate increased cash from operations is primarily a function of our ability to continue to generate net income  improve our collection efforts on outstanding accounts receivable and execute sound cash management related to accounts payable 
our ability to continue to generate net income is primarily a function of increased revenue without a corresponding increase in our expenses 
from to  our revenue increased from million to million  a increase 
for the same period  our total operating expenses increased  from million in to million in from to  our revenue increased from million to million  a increase 
for the same period  our total operating expenses increased  from million in to million in  a increase 
included in the net income is a tax benefit of million primarily related to the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  defined as ending gross accounts receivable and unbilled revenue divided by the trailing days average daily sales  has decreased from days at december  to days at december  our ability to improve our dso has been a result of a concerted effort to work with our customers at the time of billing remittance to improve payment processing and approvals and understanding of the billing content and services provided 
our customers have worked with us to ensure payments are processed in a more timely manner relative to prior periods 
we have also been diligent in working with our vendors to obtain more favorable payment terms 
further  we have benefited from the collection of up front fees related to our deferred revenue recognition whereby customers are billed and pay us for up front fees that are required to be deferred under sab these up front fees are non refundable 
the amount of these billings have increased relative to prior periods which has provided a significant cash benefit  as evidenced by our deferred revenue balances at december  most of this balance has already been billed and collected 
we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to continue to maintain and possibly improve on our dso 
given the state of the telecommunications industry and the associated financial difficulties and bankruptcies recently announced by certain companies  we continue to address our exposure to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable from certain customers 
the services we provide to our customers are generally considered mission critical 
as a result  we are often deemed to be a critical vendor for payment status which aids in our ability to collect on our invoices in a timely manner 
if our customers delay payment to us in the future  our dso could be adversely impacted 
our ability to receive tax credits for future research and development expenses could be adversely impacted in future periods as the laws surrounding the utilization are set to expire in june investing activities the following summarizes our cash used in investing activities million million million our use of cash for investing activities has been driven by our investments in capital assets and software development projects 
capital asset purchases of million in related primarily to additional hardware and software investments to enhance our infrastructure and software applications 
we also acquired additional equipment and software of million through capital leases 
the million utilized in for investing activities included a material investment in leasehold improvements and capital assets for our new corporate facility which totaled approximately million 
in  we also acquired approximately million in capital assets for enhancements to our software applications and network infrastructure  along with an additional million in new capital leases 
our software development investments in totaled million  compared to million in and million in we invested in several significant software development efforts during these periods  including our commercial database product offering  enhancements to our intellicast sm product offering and platform  our mpc  pde and ees offerings in wireless and significant investments in new product offerings in wireline  most notably our im product  which is a web based front end application for our ilec license customers 
the decline in capitalized software investment activities from to is attributable to completion of several of the initiatives undertaken in  and a reallocation of development efforts to direct projects for customer support initiatives that were not capitalized 
the increase in capitalized software investment activities from to is primarily due to investments in several significant projects that reached technological feasibility during  including intellibase sm nrlldb  the mpc project in our wireless business unit and a major software enhancement in our wireline business unit 
financing activities the following table summarizes our cash provided by or used in financing activities million million million in  we paid the first of three million payments to nvp ii associated with our contingent purchase obligation 
we also repaid million on capital lease obligations  paid million on the assumed inventory obligation from the lpss acquisitions  and paid principal payments of million on notes payable to ge capital 
as mentioned earlier  we refinanced our revolving line of credit with ge capital and entered into a second term loan that was a source of funds of million 
an additional material source of funds in was million related to stock option exercises 
the amount of option exercises in was significantly higher than the million proceeds in  most likely attributable to the increased stock price of the company in where the stock increased from at december  to at the end of since more options had vested and the stock price was greater than the exercise price  several option holders took advantage of the accretion in the price to exercise their shares 
as a result of the higher stock price  proceeds from option exercises were materially higher than we had originally forecasted 
in  we paid million of the outstanding principal balance on the revolving line of credit from cash generated from operations and utilized million to finance short term operational requirements 
the requirement to utilize the revolver was primarily a function of our leasehold improvement investments in our new corporate facility 
in the second half of  based on cash from operations and the fact we had completed the majority of our leasehold investments  we were able to utilize our cash on hand to retire some of the previously incurred debt on the revolver from in  since we were generating significant cash from operations and did not incur the level of capital investments as we incurred in  we did not utilize the revolving line of credit to finance operational or investment needs 
as of december   we have a revolving line of credit that is available to meet operating needs 
borrowing availability may not exceed the lower of i million  or ii two times adjusted ebitda or million at december  as defined in the line of credit agreement  which was amended in november the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is equal to the lower of the prime rate plus  which was as of december   or libor plus per annum  which was as of december  the line of credit matures on december   requires a million minimum balance to be maintained and is collateralized by accounts receivable and certain other assets 
as of december   million was outstanding and an additional million was available for additional borrowings   is being utilized to satisfy letter of credit obligations related to the occupancy of our primary facilities in longmont  colorado and lisle  illinois 
we also have access to a maximum of million through capital lease lines with two entities 
the interest rate is equal to the entities cost of funds plus an additional interest rate profit at the time of each lease 
each lease schedule is collateralized by the underlying assets and is subject to review and approval by the lessor at the time of our application 
each lease has either a month or a month termination date 
as of december   we have utilized approximately million of the million available under the capital lease lines 
as of december   we have a secured term loan from ge capital  payable in monthly installments of  through october  the interest rate on this term loan is equal to the prime rate plus  which was at december  as of december   the outstanding balance on this term loan was million 
as of december   we have a second secured term loan from ge capital  payable in quarterly installments of  through april  the interest rate on this term loan is equal to the lower of a prime rate plus  or b libor plus 
at december   the libor plus was  lower than the prime rate plus  which was 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the second term loan was million 
on february   we entered into the fifth amendment to our loan and security agreement with general electric capital corporation in order to ensure that we will have additional flexibility in conducting domestic and international operations by eliminating the requirement to obtain the lender s consent for an acquisition or acquisitions that  in aggregate  are valued at less than million  or inter company transfers of funds between us and any foreign subsidiary  that  in aggregate  would exceed a million balance at any point in time 
covenant compliance we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  assessment of future liquidity based on available cash resources  anticipated capital expenditures and projected operating cash flow  we believe that we will be able to adequately fund our operations through at least the next twelve months 
in making this assessment  we have considered our consolidated cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   the availability of funding under our revolving credit facility  the anticipated level of capital expenditures during  the million redemption of preferred stock  presently held by nvp ii  in two equal payments of approximately million  with such payments to be made in june and june  respectively  presently scheduled debt service requirements during  and our expectation of realizing positive cash flow from operations through the availability of borrowings under our credit facility and lease line of credit is subject to covenants and limitations and require us to maintain compliance with specified operating and financial covenants as described earlier 
while we were in compliance with all covenant ratios at december   there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios over time  especially if our debt borrowings increase or our operating results are not sufficient to cover our fixed financing payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk to the extent that united states interest rates change due to inflation or other factors 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
the interest payable on our line of credit and one of our two term loans is determined based on the lower of prime rate plus or libor plus per annum  and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates  similarly  the interest payable on our second term loan is prime based and  therefore  is subject to market interest rate fluctuations 
interest rates on our capital lease lines are dependent on interest rates in effect at the time the lease line is drawn upon 
total liabilities outstanding at december  under the line of credit and capital lease lines were approximately million 
based on amounts borrowed as of december   we would have a resulting decline in future annual earnings and cash flows of approximately  for every increase in prime lending rates 
we have no plans to use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities
