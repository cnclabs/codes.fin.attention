item and a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk executive overview the business of the company is the production and sale of copper in a socially conscious manner 
in the process of producing copper a number of valuable metallurgical by products are recovered  these also are sold by spcc 
the sales prices for company products are largely determined by market forces outside of the company s control 
company management  therefore  focuses on cost control and production enhancement to improve profitability 
the company achieves these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
this focus enables spcc to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize results in periods of high copper prices 
in the company saw the average copper price increase by about cents per pound from the preceding year 
indeed  the copper price ended at per pound  about cents above the december  copper price 
through early the copper price has further increased  average of per pound through february 
an overall benchmark used by the company to measure performance is its operating cash cost to produce a pound of copper 
operating cash cost per pound of copper produced is defined as the total production cost  including the cost of purchased concentrate  freight and sales expenses  administrative expenses  and credits for by products divided by total pounds of copper produced by spcc plus pounds of purchased concentrates 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of spcc s operating cash cost per pound to gaap cost of sales is presented on page the company s operating cash cost for the past three years were cents per pound cents per pound cents per pound the cost reduction in is to a large extent attributable to the increase in the molybdenum sales price in the past years 
the credit to the above costs for molybdenum sales amounted to cents per pound  cents per pound and cents per pound  in  and  respectively significant goals and records achieved in include  the toquepala concentrator produced  tons of concentrate  a new production record  the cuajone concentrator also produced a new record  with the production of  tons of concentrate  the cuajone mine increased molybdenum production to  tons an increase of over  a new production record  and the ilo refinery produced  tons of electrolytic copper  yet another new production record 
in addition  the company has environmental programs at its operations 
capital spending include those projects  which enhance production and improve cost performance  as well as those which improve the environmental performance of the company 
in  the company resolved differences with the peruvian ministry of energy and mines mem over the ilo smelter modernization and selected a contractor for the project 
the project is moving forward and  is expected to be completed before january  the deadline agreed to with mem 
in addition  the company continues to operate the supplementary control program at ilo  a voluntary effort  whereby smelter operations are curtailed during periods of adverse weather conditions 
spcc has maintained exploration programs for a number of years 
in  the scope of the programs was expanded to include sites outside of peru 
the company acquired a number of interesting sites in chile and in the future would consider exploration in other latin american areas if promising sites were located 
company management believes that its profit goals and its environmental agenda are better served by policies engendering harmonious relations with the neighboring communities and with strong open ties with the spcc team workers  supervisors and management 
accordingly  the company has community involvement programs at its operating locations 
the company provides services to local citizens  as well as support for agricultural  cultural and educational programs 
the company maintains active employee training programs and strives to enhance the work experience of its staff 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian new sol the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
portions of the company s operating costs are denominated in peruvian new soles 
since the revenues of the company are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the new sol to the dollar  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company could be adversely affected 
the value of the net assets of the company denominated in new soles can be affected by devaluation on the new sol 
the recent inflation and devaluation rates are as follows years ended december peruvian inflation deflation rate new sol dollar change in exchange rate year to year peruvian branch the consolidated financial statements included herein are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the peruvian branch consists of substantially all the assets and liabilities of southern peru associated with its copper operations in the republic of peru 
the branch is registered with the peruvian government as a branch of a foreign mining company 
the results of the branch are consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
for peruvian reporting purposes  the branch maintains its books of account in new soles and prepares financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in peru peruvian gaap 
peruvian gaap requires the inclusion in the financial statements of the branch of the resultado por exposici n a la inflaci n result of exposure to inflation  which seeks to account for the effects of inflation by adjusting the value of non monetary assets and liabilities and equity by a factor corresponding to wholesale price inflation rates during the period covered by the financial statements 
monetary assets and liabilities are not so adjusted 
expansion and modernization program toquepala concentrator expansion in september  the company completed the expansion of the toquepala concentrator raising mineral processing capacity from  tons per day to  tons per day 
the concentrator milled million tons of ore in  compared to million tons in as a result spcc s use of third party concentrate decreased from  tons in to  tons in spending on the project  through amounted to million 
the company expects to spend million in to further enhance this project 
ilo refinery in  the company completed a feasibility study to expand production capacity at the ilo refinery to  tons per year  an increase of  tons per year over current capacity 
while the study s results were favorable a decision to move ahead with this project is on hold pending the completion of previously committed projects 
toquepala leach dump project on january   the board of directors approved the toquepala leach dump project 
the project includes the installation of a crushing  conveying and spreading system at the toquepala leach dumps 
the project is estimated to be completed in mid at a budgeted cost of million 
as of december  million has been expended on this project 
the project is expected to reduce production costs for spcc s leaching facilities by eliminating costly truck haulage in the process 
auxiliary dams quebrada honda the construction of auxiliary dams at quebrada honda is in process 
it includes the construction of three auxiliary dams  which will prevent decanted water of the quebrada honda embankment reservoir from entering the quebrada santallana  these dams will also serve as initial dams in case spcc decides to increase the embankment volume of the quebrada honda dam 
the project has an approved budget of million  of which million has been expended through tailings disposal project research studies for tailings disposal at toquepala and cuajone continue 
new alternatives  including the use of new reagents and the installation of new equipment  using new techniques  are under consideration 
the goal of the project remains the enhancement of the recovery and reuse of water resources  which will improve production costs and conserve scarce resources 
through the company has expended million out of an approved budget of million 
smelter modernization the company s largest outstanding capital investment project is the ilo smelter modernization 
the project is part of the company s environmental compliance and management program known by its spanish acronym  pama  which was approved by the peruvian government in the project will modernize the smelter and is targeted to capture no less than percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions  in compliance with pama requirements 
the project originally encompassed a two phase approach to reach a final deadline for completion by january in the third quarter of the peruvian ministry of energy and mines accepted a modification proposed by the company to complete the smelter modernization in one phase within the final deadline originally established in the pama 
in july  the company awarded the contract to provide the technology and basic engineering for the modernization of the ilo smelter to fluor xstrata 
the selected proposal meets with spcc s requirements  which are the use of proven technology the isasmelt from australia and comply with the current environmental regulations 
it is estimated that the construction of the project will be completed before january  the deadline established in the pama 
the cost of the project was previously estimated to exceed million  but after the completion of the basic engineering by fluor xstrata  the new estimated cost to complete this project is million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has discussed the following critical accounting policies with its audit committee 
southern peru copper corporation s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires southern peru s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate  which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management 
areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include revenue recognition  ore reserves  capitalized mine stripping and related estimated mine stripping ratios  the estimated useful lives of fixed assets  asset retirement obligations  litigation and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition approximately  and for the years  and  respectively  of the company s metal production was sold under annual or longer term contracts 
revenues derived from product sales are recognized upon the transfer of title of the inventories to customers  which coincides with the shipment of products to customers in satisfaction of orders 
as of december   the company believes that an allowance for doubtful accounts on product sales is not required as losses from uncollectible accounts receivable from customers have historically been insignificant and the company believes all of its customers have the ability and intent to pay such amounts 
for certain of the company s sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the monthly average proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case for sales of molybdenum products  ranging between one and three months subsequent to the shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of the shipment  based on lme or comex spot prices for copper sales  and the industry trade publication s proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum 
the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
in the years ended december  and  the final adjustment related to the provisionally priced contracts for sales during the last quarter of the previous year totaled million and million 
we believe the final adjustment related to the provisionally priced contracts for the sales in the last quarter of the year ended december  will substantially exceed the adjustments in prior years as the price of copper has continued to rise during the first quarter of these provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded derivative instrument under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb as amended 
as of december   and  the years in which the company accounted for such embedded derivatives in accordance with the provisions of fasb  the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments  which corresponds to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above  amounted to million  million and million  respectively  and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
ore reserves southern peru periodically reevaluates estimates of its ore reserves  which represent the company s estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in its existing mine locations that can be produced and sold at a profit 
such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples of drill holes and other openings  combined with assumptions about copper market prices and production costs 
the company s current ore reserve estimates utilize a three year average price per pound of copper assumption and actual production cost data as of the most recent reserves declarations  which were made in for the cuajone mine and in for the toquepala mine 
the three year price of copper used in determining ore reserves was cents per pound 
prior to  the company utilized a cents per pound copper price in its ore reserve estimates  which the company believes to be a valid price assumption over an extended period 
at december  the three year average price per pound of copper was cents and is being used to determine ore reserves for at december  the remaining lives of the company mines are years and years  for the toquepala and cuajone mine  respectively 
the reserves estimates have been adjusted for actual production since the most recent reserve declarations 
many companies declare their ore reserves on an annual basis 
the company believes that ore reserves determined by its method closely approximates the ore reserve quantities if they were determined as of december  southern peru uses its ore reserve estimates in determining the amount of mine stripping capitalized  units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping depletion of mineral land and amortization of intangible asset mineral land 
mine stripping ratios in carrying out its mining operations  the company is required to remove waste materials to access mineral deposits 
because the concentration of mineral deposits is not evenly distributed throughout the mines  there are periods during the life of the mine where the company mines more or better quality reserves as compared to waste removed  and periods during which the company mines less or lower quality reserves as compared to waste removed 
for each of its existing mines in the production stage  the company s mine engineers have calculated a life of mine stripping ratio which represents the company s estimate of the total amount of waste to be incurred divided by the estimated total proven and probable reserves at each mine 
the mine stripping ratios are used to determine the amount of mine production costs to be charged against earnings 
in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore extracted exceeds the life of mine stripping ratios  the company capitalizes production costs associated with mining operations in proportion to the excess waste mined 
such capitalized costs are included in net capitalized mine stripping  and are amortized using the units of production method 
copper resources contained in piles of leachable materials that have been extracted from the mines are not included in the determination of units of production amortization 
conversely  in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore mined is less than the life of mine stripping ratios  the company reduces the net capitalized mine stripping asset proportionally with a charge to amortization expense 
during periods the company is stripping at the higher rates  increased mining costs associated with the higher tonnages are incurred 
costs of this nature are necessary in a mining operation to insure the availability of mineable ore in future periods 
the company understands that the sec is currently evaluating methods for accounting for mine stripping costs 
in addition  the company is aware that in recent public comments  the sec has expressed unfavorable views towards the company s method of accounting for mine stripping costs 
however  the company believes that its method of accounting for mine stripping costs  which effectively results in the smoothing of production costs over the lives of its mines  accurately reflects the results and operations of its mining operations and also facilitates improved matching of revenues and related expenses 
during  and the company s stripping ratio was higher than the life of mine stripping ratio for both the toquepala and cuajone mines  which resulted in the capitalization of mine costs associated with the additional waste mined 
if the company were to have expensed all production costs associated with its mining operations as incurred  net operating cost expenses would have increased by million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
estimated life of mine stripping ratios for each of the company s mines for the years ended december   and  were as follows life of mine stripping ratio toquepala cuajone the life of mine stripping ratios for both mines changed at year end and because of changes in the copper price assumption used and because of changes obtained from mine plan studies to calculate the ore reserves 
at year end  and  the company used a per pound copper price of  and  respectively 
beginning with year end the company began using the three year average comex copper price  in earlier years the company used a per pound price to calculate ore reserves 
in addition  in spcc implemented recommendations from a mine plan study  which changed the stripping ratios 
estimated useful lives of assets estimated useful lives of the company s fixed assets are based on periodic evaluation by the company s management and engineers 
changes in such estimates could significantly affect  among other things  the company s operating costs and net income 
during the first quarter of  the company changed the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment to reflect additional information as to historical experience 
this change was accounted for prospectively and resulted in a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million in asset retirement obligation the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations in this statement requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded 
in order to determine the amount of the liability the company must estimate the cost of fulfilling the retirement obligation 
the company calculates this estimated obligation using available facts  existing technology  current laws and regulations  current costs  and expected costs as determined by company engineers 
this estimation is also based on inflation assumptions using the us cpi consumer price index and using the company s risk free credit rate which is based on the company s credit status 
litigation and contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal and tax proceedings 
as discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consulting legal and tax counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions of the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings  or when they are resolved in future periods 
results of operations for the years ended december   and spcc reported net earnings as follows for the years ended december  net earnings in millions increase decrease from prior year earnings per share the increase in net earnings in is due principally to higher copper and molybdenum prices and to higher sales volume of copper and molybdenum 
copper prices on the lme and comex were about ten cents higher in and ended the year about cents higher then the year end price 
the volume of copper sold increased by million pounds and the volume of spcc produced copper increased by million pounds 
the contribution of molybdenum to net sales increased to million in from million in  attributable to a increase in price and an increase of almost in volume 
the results were reduced by a million deferred tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect a increase in the peruvian income tax rate for years after us gaap requires that deferred taxes be recorded based on the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which the temporary differences are expected to be settled 
operating break even cost was reduced by cents per pound in to cents per pound in from cents per pound in this reduction is an improvement of in the increase in net earnings in compared with is due to the increase in metal prices for molybdenum and silver  the more important by products of the company  despite a slight decrease in copper prices and volume 
in addition  cost cutting programs  such as the retirement in force program  reduced administrative and production costs in operating break even cost was reduced by cents per pound to cents per pound in from cents per pound in this reduction represents a improvement over interest expense decreased million in as a significant amount of company debt was prepaid in early interest income also decreased as cash previously available for investing was utilized in the debt prepayment 
the decrease in interest income in as compared to was million 
net sales net sales in were million  compared with million in  an increase in of million 
the increase is mainly due to higher sales prices and higher sales volumes for copper and molybdenum 
copper sales volume in increased by million pounds as spcc production increased because of the toquepala mill expansion completed in the second half of and due to higher ore grades and recoveries at the cuajone mine 
sales of spcc mined copper actually increased by million pounds  and the company s need for third party concentrates was reduced 
the average copper price increased by approximately cents per pound in  as copper prices increased significantly in the fourth quarter of the year end per pound price of copper on the lme and the comex was and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  molybdenum sales increased in  as the price increased by and sales volume was higher by million pounds 
net sales in were million  compared with million in the increase of million is mainly due to higher molybdenum prices in  which increased net sales by approximately million  reduced by lower copper prices and a million reduction in pounds of copper sold  in part due to a strike in the fourth quarter of which reduced copper production by million pounds 
at december  there were million pounds of copper sales recorded at a provisional price of per pound 
also the company has recorded million pounds of molybdenum sales at a provisional price of per pound 
prices sales prices for the company s metals are established principally by reference to prices quoted on the london metal exchange lme  the new york commodity exchange comex or published in platt s metals week for dealer oxide mean prices for molybdenum products 
price volume data average metal prices copper per pound lme copper per pound comex molybdenum per pound silver per ounce comex sales volume in thousands copper pounds molybdenum pounds silver ounces the company s molybdenum production is sold in concentrate form 
volume represents pounds of molybdenum contained in concentrates 
provisional pricing arrangements for certain of the company s sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case of molybdenum products  ranging between one and three months subsequent to the shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment  based on lme comex spot prices for copper sales  and the platt s proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum 
the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
these provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded derivate instrument under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb as amended 
as of december    and the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments  which correspond to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above  amounted to million  million and million  respectively  and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
from time to time  the company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
derivative instruments which are designated as hedges must be deemed highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported in current earnings 
in past years the company has used copper put options to reduce the risk of copper price declines on a portion of its anticipated sales 
in addition  the company entered into fuel swap arrangements  to limit the effect of increases in fuel price on production cost  and foreign currency swaps to limit the effects of exchange rate changes on future cash flow obligations denominated in foreign currency 
for the years ended december   and the company held no copper put options or fuel swap arrangements 
the company held no currency swap agreements for and during the year ended december   the company took physical settlement for its currency swap agreements related to a portion of its capital costs contracted in euros for which there was a loss of approximately million 
as a result of accepting euros in settlement of these currency swap arrangements  the company acquired and held euros as part of its cash balances in and due to these cash balances in euros  the company recognized exchange gains of million and million in and  respectively 
the company utilized its euro cash balances in the first quarter of cost of sales cost of sales was million in  million in and million in in  the company s cost of sales was million higher than the prior year 
sales of company produced copper increased by million pounds while sales of copper processed from third party concentrate decreased by million pounds 
the significant factors causing the increase were higher fuel and power costs in including a one time payment of million to enersur sa  the company s power provider  and an increase of million for workers participation  a cost based on a percentage of pre tax earnings  which increases as company profits increase 
the decrease of million in against includes the lower volume of copper processed and sold from purchased concentrates  and the lower cost of company mined copper as a result of a decrease in volume sold and lower operating costs 
other expenses depreciation  amortization and depletion expense was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in was mainly due to capitalization and depreciation of new projects 
the decrease in was mainly due to a change made to the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets  this reduced depreciation expense in by million 
this decrease was somewhat offset by an adjustment to fixed assets which resulted in a million pre tax charge to depreciation  such adjustment resulted from an analysis of fixed assets which identified this difference 
exploration expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was principally due to the company s purchase of exploration properties for million from asarco  a company indirectly owned by spcc s majority stockholder 
the company used an independent appraisal firm to determine the value of these properties 
as the properties have not yet reached the development stage  the cost of this acquisition was charged to earnings as an exploration expense 
non operating items interest income was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in reflects higher amounts of invested cash 
the decrease in reflects lower amount of invested cash 
in early  the company used million of its excess cash to prepay long term debt 
the company invests principally in short term securities 
other income expense was million in  compared with million in and million in other income expense generally includes miscellaneous camp and school income and medical services to third parties  as well as scrap sales 
the amount includes an million penalty  paid in connection with the prepayment  in  of the balance of the company s secured export note financing 
the company decided to incur the penalty in retiring this debt because the penalty offset the present value of the amount of interest that would have been due over the term of the debt 
further  in retiring the debt  the company was then permitted to avail itself of potentially more attractive long term financing in the future 
total interest cost was million in  compared with million in and million in in  and  the company capitalized million  million and million of interest  respectively  related to expenditures for the expansion program 
the decrease in and interest expense is due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates 
in february the company prepaid million of its long term debt 
in connection with this prepayment  an unamortized balance of million of deferred loan commissions was expensed in a prepayment penalty of million was paid in connection with the prepayment made in december of the million credit line facility disbursed in march the unamortized balance of million of commission fee related to this credit line was charged as other expenses in taxes on income taxes on income were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and include million  million and million of peruvian income taxes  million  million and million for us federal and state taxes for  and  respectively 
us income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income as well as limitations on use of foreign tax credits in determining the alternative minimum tax 
the effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from the effective tax rate is primarily due to the increase in the carrying value of deferred taxes as the result of the enacted income tax rate increase from to in peru 
the effective tax rate increased from the effective tax rate as the result of the peruvian tax on net income deemed distributed and the diminished utilization of foreign tax credits  partially offset by the benefit of a reduction from to in the statutory income tax rate 
on december   the peruvian government established a new tax rate of for years beginning after although this new rate does not affect the current taxes payable  the change in the tax rate does require that the deferred peruvian assets and liabilities be revalued at the tax rate expected to apply when these assets and liabilities are realized 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million as additional tax deferred expense for the rate change 
the company obtains income tax credits in peru for value added taxes paid in connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and services employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid expense 
under current peruvian law  the company is entitled to use the credits against its peruvian income tax liability or to receive a refund 
the carrying value of these peruvian tax credits approximates their net realizable value 
minority interest of investment shares minority interest of investment shares was million in  compared with million in and million in the provision for minority interest of investment shares represents  and for  and  respectively  of the branch s after tax earnings 
the reduction in the percentage of minority interest of investment shares in was the result of purchases of investment shares by the company 
the acquisition of the investment shares has been accounted for as the purchase of a minority interest 
the excess purchase price over the cost of the shares of  million and million  in  and  respectively  has been allocated to intangible assets mining concessions on the company s balance sheet 
cash flows operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with million in and million in the increase of million in was principally attributable to improved cash earnings  largely generated by production increases and improvement in metal prices 
expenditures for capitalized mine stripping decreased in  by million  from the prior year 
during the contribution from operating assets and liabilities decreased by million from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily a result of the higher metal prices at year end  the lme copper price was at december   compared with at december   which increased the accounts receivable balances at year end the accounts receivable increase reduced cash flow by million in  as compared to an increase of million in the contribution to cash flow from the decrease in inventory was million more in than in addition  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased cash flow by million more than accruals for income taxes and workers participations were much higher in  as spcc s earnings increased 
an increase in prepaid taxes reduced cash flow by million  in the decrease in prepaid taxes added million to cash flow 
the decrease in  of million  was principally attributable to million lower cash provided by operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by the increase in earnings of million  less an increase of million in capitalized mine stripping and a decrease of million in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
in  the company changed the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets  which reduced depreciation expense by million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities was caused by a decrease in the cash flow from accounts receivable of million and from inventories of million 
the decrease was reduced by increased cash flow contributions from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  and prepaid taxes of million 
in the company collected a pending tax drawback from the peruvian government  which enhanced the cash flow from accounts receivable 
cash flows investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million in compared with million in and million in capital expenditures in  and reflect the company s expansion and modernization program 
capital expenditures for the years and were higher than and included principally the investment in the toquepala concentrator expansion of million and million respectively 
additionally the company expended million in for the expansion of the toquepala sx ew facility 
the company s budgeted capital expenditures for are million  which includes million for the ilo smelter modernization  million for the toquepala leach dump project and million for additions and replacement of equipment at the company s three operating areas 
cash flows financing activities financing activities provided cash of million in and million in in  financing activities used cash of million 
in  the company issued million in bonds in the peruvian market 
proceeds from these bonds will be used to help finance the company s capital programs 
dividends paid during the year amounted to million and represented of the earnings on which they were paid 
in addition  the company paid million to holders of investment shares 
the company also purchased investment shares for million 
financing activities used cash of million in and included debt payments of million  including a prepayment of million  new debt incurred of million and escrow funds of million returned to the company 
in addition  the company paid dividends of million to common stockholders and million to holders of investment shares 
the company also purchased investment shares for million 
liquidity and capital resources financing in  the company was authorized by the comision nacional supervisora de empresas y valores conasev to issue up to million of bonds in the peruvian market 
the goal of this bond facility is to support the company s expansion and modernization program  by extending maturity of the company s debt obligations and by reducing financing costs 
in february  the company sold to investors in peru bonds for million  at an interest rate of libor plus  with maturities ranging from may to february in  the company sold to investors in peru bonds for million with maturities ranging from january to may these bonds were sold in two tranches of million each and have interest rates of libor plus and libor plus 
prior to  million of bonds were sold under this program with maturities ranging from march to december total issuances under the program now total million 
the interest rates on these bonds are adjusted on a quarterly basis 
proceeds from the sale of these bonds are being used to finance a portion of the company s capital spending program 
in  the company entered a million  year loan agreement with mitsui maturing in the interest rate for this loan is the japanese libo rate plus japanese libo rate at december  was 
this facility provided additional committed financing for spcc s modernization and expansion program  and was fully disbursed as of december  the mitsui credit agreement is collateralized by pledges of receivables of  tons of copper per year 
at december  the company had outstanding borrowings of million  compared with million at december  both the mitsui agreement and the peruvian bond program require the company to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of million  and a specific ratio of debt to equity 
reduction of grupo mexico s direct or indirect voting interest in the company to less than a majority would constitute an event of default under the mitsui agreement 
the peruvian bond program contains a limitation on the payment of stockholder dividends of no more than of net income for any fiscal year 
the company was in compliance with the various financing agreements at december  on march   southern peru holdings corporation  the direct stockholder of the company  and a subsidiary of asarco  sold all its stock in the company to amc  the parent of asarco 
immediately after the transaction  the shares were transferred to sphc ii incorporated  a subsidiary of amc  and were pledged to a group of financial institutions 
pursuant to a financing agreement  amc has agreed to comply with financial covenants  involving spcc  including covenants requiring the maintenance of minimum stockholders equity of million  adjusted to include of earnings after  cash proceeds from equity offerings and stockholder contributions  specific debt to equity ratios and interest coverage ratios
