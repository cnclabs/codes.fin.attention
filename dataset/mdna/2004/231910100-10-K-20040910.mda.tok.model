total revenues  which consist of product sales and software maintenance and professional services revenues  increased from million for fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or

revenues from training  consulting and installations made up the balance of the growth of service revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year cost of revenues and gross profit 
total cost of revenues  which includes products and services costs  increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or 
the increase was primarily due to the increased product sales and services revenues for fiscal year total gross profit was for fiscal year and for fiscal year gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including competition  the mix in average selling prices of products we currently offer  oem sales  new product introduction and enhancements  fluctuation in manufacturing volumes and incremental cost of supporting the increased installed customer base 
the reduction in product related gross profit was primarily the result of a change in the product mix as a result of the acquisition of snapgear in november of the security solutions for the sg product range are used in regional  branch and small offices of small to medium sized enterprises 
these products fall into more of a commodity offering and margins are lower than the traditional cyberguard offerings 
in addition  the oem component of revenues has margins  which are substantially lower than those products that are sold through channel relationships 
the gross margin was also negatively impacted by the amortization of acquisition related charges which totaled  during gross profit for services was million  or  for fiscal year as compared to million  or  for fiscal year the decrease in service related gross profit was a result of the increase in headcount of the support maintenance engineers

table of contents net income loss 
for fiscal year we recorded net income of million compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year this improvement is the direct result of the increase in revenues for fiscal year versus fiscal year and a continued focus on maintaining appropriate cost controls and operating efficiencies 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  which consist principally of commercial paper and us government securities 
for the fiscal year  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by  to million from million at june  cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities was million

the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of june  currently  we have no agreements or arrangements for third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  acquisitions  the timing and extent of spending on support  product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancement to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
we are not aware of any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way 
there can be no assurance  however  that the assumptions upon which we base our future working capital and capital expenditure requirements will prove to be correct 
if these assumptions are not correct  we may be required to raise additional capital through loans or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity  ownership dilution to existing shareholders will result  and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
moreover  additional capital may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms  or may not be available at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements  including revenue recognition  bad debt  software development costs  inventory valuation and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop software revenue recognition and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of the company s sales transactions 
the company s revenue is primarily from the following sources i product sales of firewall appliances and software licenses to resellers and end users  ii product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions to oem customers  and iii service revenue which is primarily maintenance which provides for customer support 
revenues from product sales are recognized only when a contract or agreement has been executed  delivery of the appliance has occurred or for software licenses an authorization code or subscription activation has been delivered to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable and we believe collection is probable 
product revenue is generally recognized on product shipment  this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain 
there is no product right of return available to the customer 
for software licenses  revenue is generally recognized on the delivery of the authorization code for perpetual licenses or upon activation of the subscription licenses 
subscription license revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the subscription 
we defer revenues on product sales for new value added resellers where we are unable to determine the ability of the reseller to honor a commitment to make fixed or determinable payment 
revenue will be deferred until the resellers demonstrate consistency of payment within terms and there are no instances where we have to take back the product because of non payment for a three month period 
for the year ended june   twenty one resellers were reclassified from cash basis to accrual  based on a reasonable assurance of collectibility from evaluating their payment history and no product returns 
the impact of the reclassifications did not have a material effect on revenue 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions when such specifications have been met and the title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales to one customer on a bill and hold 
table of contents basis in accordance with the criteria established by sab for such transactions 
revenue is recognized after the risk of ownership has passed to the customer and when there are no remaining performance obligations on the part of the company 
this applies to revenue generated from a customer of the snapgear subsidiary 
service revenues consist primarily of the annual fee for maintenance post contract customer support and maintenance renewals from our existing customers and are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the service contract term 
these services provide our customers access to our worldwide support organization for technical support  unspecified product updates enhancements on a when and if available basis  and general security information 
the updates are considered minor enhancements to the software that are not separately marketable or considered a competitive feature or major upgrade 
all products and services are separately priced 
the company also provides other professional support services  such as training and consulting  which are available under service agreements and charged for separately 
these services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
significant judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including the probability of collection and the credit worthiness of each customer 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and other factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance might be required 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs its test of goodwill on an annual basis on the anniversary date of recording goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred 
testing would be done on a more frequent basis  if impairment indicators arise 
no impairment has been identified or recorded during fiscal as goodwill was recorded for the first time in november in connection with the snapgear acquisition and in april in connection with the webwasher acquisition 
intangibles intangible assets are primarily an allocation of a portion of the purchase price in connection with the snapgear and webwasher acquisitions to the following separate and identifiable intangible assets developed technology  trade name and customer base 
intangible assets are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method using the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
trade name was determined to have an indefinite life and is not being amortized but is subject to impairment testing 
software development costs 
we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed which requires capitalization to begin when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
software development costs incurred prior to technological feasibility  defined by implementation of a beta project  are considered research and development costs and are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line method over two years and is the greater of the two amounts calculated using the methods noted in sfas no 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of component parts and computer hardware and are carried at the lower of cost  determined by the first in first out method  or market 
we write our 
table of contents inventories down to estimated market value based on assumptions of our future demand  based on projected product releases and market conditions 
variation in market trends  customer preferences  introduction of new products replacing existing products or technological advances could  however  significantly affect these estimates and result in additional inventory write downs 
evaluation inventory older than six months is transferred to fixed assets and depreciated over months 
deferred taxes 
we provide a valuation allowance for that portion of deferred tax assets  which is not more likely than not to be recognized due to the company s cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
any reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance is made when we believe that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the computation of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance is based on taxable income we expect to earn over the next nine quarters which will include the utilization of previously accumulated net operating tax losses 
we will continue to evaluate each quarter the amount  if any  of additional reduction or increase of the valuation allowance that should be made 
this will be based on management s estimate and conclusions regarding the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets  including but not limited to  the company s recent positive financial results as well as projected earnings over nine quarters 
the impact of further reductions of the valuation allowance will be to record a tax benefit  which will increase net income in the period the determination is made

these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
