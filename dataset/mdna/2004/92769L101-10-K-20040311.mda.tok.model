item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview on january   we emerged from reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as part of the plan  we reduced our indebtedness significantly and changed our name from ntl communications corp 
to ntl incorporated 
we are a leading broadband and communications services company in the uk and the republic of ireland based on total residential subscriber numbers 
we provide our services to our customers through five reportable segments 
ntl home provides residential telephone  cable television and internet services  as well as wholesale internet access solutions to isps in the uk 
ntl business provides data  voice and internet services to large businesses  public sector organizations and smes located near our existing residential broadband network in the uk 
ntl broadcast provides dtv  atv and radio broadcast transmission services  network management  tower site rental and satellite and media services as well as radio communications to public safety organizations in the uk 
ntl carriers provides national and international communications transport services for communications companies in the uk and the republic of ireland 
ntl ireland provides primarily cable television services  as well as telephone and internet services  to residential customers and television  data  voice and internet services to business customers in the republic of ireland 
our reportable segments are supported by various central shared services including ntl networks  which manages our uk national network 
other shared services include finance  it and human resources 
ntl ireland relies upon these central shared services to a lesser extent than our other reportable segments 
our revenues and segment profit loss in dollars and uk pounds as well as segment profit as a percentage of revenues for each of our reportable segments and shared services division for the years ended december    and were as follows year ended december  in millions  except for percentage amounts revenues ntl home      ntl business ntl broadcast ntl carriers ntl ireland total revenues      segment profit loss ntl home  ntl business ntl broadcast ntl carriers ntl ireland shared services combined segment profit  segment profit as a percentage of revenues ntl home ntl business ntl broadcast ntl carriers ntl ireland shared services combined segment profit as a percentage of revenues revenues the principal sources of revenues within each reportable segment are ntl home monthly fees and usage charges for telephone service  cable television service and internet access as well as fees and charges for wholesale internet access solutions in the uk  ntl business monthly fees and usage charges for inbound and outbound voice  data and internet services in the uk  ntl broadcast charges for site leasing services  television and radio broadcasting and satellite up linking for program and content distribution in the uk 
we also derive revenues from various communications services provided to public safety organizations  ntl carriers charges for transmission  fiber and voice services provided to other telecommunications service providers over our national network in the uk and the republic of ireland  and ntl ireland charges for cable television services and  to a lesser extent  telephone and internet services in the republic of ireland 
expenses the principal components of our operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses include payroll and other employee related costs  interconnection costs paid to other carriers related to telephone services  television programming costs primarily incurred by ntl home and ntl ireland  marketing and selling costs  repairs and maintenance  facility related costs  like rent  utilities and rates  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
segment profit loss our primary measure of profit or loss for each of our reportable segments is segment profit loss 
our management  including our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker  considers segment profit loss an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our reportable segments 
segment profit loss for each reportable segment and the shared services division excludes the impact of costs and expenses that either do not directly affect our cash flows or do not directly relate to the operating performance of that segment or division 
these costs and expenses include depreciation  amortization  interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains losses  share of income losses from equity investments  and taxation 
other charges  including restructuring charges  recapitalization expenses and other losses are also excluded from segment profit loss as management believes they are not characteristic of our underlying business operations 
furthermore management believes that some of the components of these charges are not directly related to the performance of a single reportable segment 
we also measure combined segment profit  which represents the combined measure of the segment profit loss from each of our reportable segments and our shared services division 
combined segment profit is not a financial measure under united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
a discussion relating to use of this measure is set forth below under use of non gaap financial measures 
combined segment profit loss should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating profit loss  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
segment reorganization 
during  we implemented a reorganization of our reportable segments by moving some operations between reportable segments 
the segmental structure described above represents the results of our realignment 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reportable segments reflecting this reorganization 
factors affecting our business ntl home 
our ntl home segment accounts for the majority of our total revenues 
the revenues of ntl home are driven by the number of customers  the number and types of services which each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services 
our segment profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to customers 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than atv 
our packaging of services and pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services like dual telephone and broadband 
the factors impacting our ntl home segment include customer churn  average revenue per user  or arpu  and competition 
summary customer statistics selected statistics in respect of customers connected directly to our network for ntl home for the three months ended december  as well as the four prior quarters are set forth in the table below 
three months ended december  september  june  march  december  total customers      gross customer additions      customer disconnects      net customer movement      churn annualized revenue generating units     television      dtv      telephone      broadband      internet dial up and dtv access     average revenue per user our customer churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost in the most recent quarter  multiplied by four  by the average total number of customers we serviced during that quarter 
there is generally a seasonal impact on customer churn rate over the summer holiday and student vacation months 
each telephone  television and broadband internet subscriber directly connected to our network counts as one revenue generating unit  or rgu 
accordingly  a subscriber who receives both telephone and television service counts as two rgus 
rgus may include subscribers receiving some services for free or at a reduced rate in connection with incentive offers 
the national cable telecommunications association reporting guidelines for the us cable industry do not recognize dial up internet customers as rgus  although they are revenue generating for us 
at december  internet dial up customers included approximately  metered customers who have not dialed up within the last days 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is calculated on a monthly basis by dividing total revenues generated from the provision of telephone  cable television and internet services to customers who are directly connected to our network that month  exclusive of vat  by the average number of customers in that month 
we compute the arpu for any quarter by averaging the arpu for each month in that quarter 
customer churn 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenues 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in an effort to manage our customer churn rate 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop using our services 
our annualized customer churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost in the most recent quarter  multiplied by four  by the average total number of customers we serviced during that quarter 
although our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season  managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
to help meet these objectives  we need to integrate our billing systems and customer databases across our entire network 
although we are in the process of integrating our billing systems and customer databases  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reaching this goal 
in addition  our customer churn rate may also increase if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption 
arpu 
arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenues from customers 
arpu is calculated on a monthly basis by dividing total revenues generated from the provision of telephone  cable television and internet services to customers who are directly connected to our network in that month  exclusive of value added tax  by the average number of customers in that month 
we compute the arpu for any quarter by averaging the arpu for each month in that quarter 
we believe that our triple play offering of telephone service  broadband access to the internet and dtv will prove attractive to our existing customer base and allow us to increase our arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenues depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets through digital satellite offered by bskyb and digital terrestrial television offered by freeview  as well as through alternative internet access services  like dsl  which is offered by bt 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenues 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through march however  our cash requirements after that time may exceed  perhaps significantly  these sources of cash 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in pounds and  to a lesser extent  euros  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december   million net of unamortized discount of million  or of our long term debt  net of unamortized discount  was in us dollars 
because revenues and expenses from our principal operations are denominated primarily in pounds but we report our financial results in us dollars  our financial results are also impacted by currency fluctuations  which are unrelated to our underlying results of operations 
seasonality 
certain revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenues in ntl home and ntl business tend to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect service owing to moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodations between school years 
integration of billing systems 
we are in the process of integrating our various billing systems and customer databases in an effort to improve one of the main tools we use to provide customer service 
we have numerous billing systems and customer databases owing to the many acquisitions we have made 
we are seeking to complete this integration by late the total project cost is estimated to be approximately million  or million  of which we incurred approximately million  or million  through december  approximately million  or million  of this amount was incurred in if the integration is not successful  we could experience an adverse effect on our customer service  customer churn rate and costs of maintaining these systems going forward 
we could also experience operational failures related to billing and collecting revenues from our customers which  depending upon on the severity of the failure  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
acquisitions and dispositions 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold the consumerco off net indirect access business  which served customers not directly connected to our network 
as a result  the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  include the results for this business for ten months 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgements and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risks and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgement and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
foreign currency translation our principal operating functional currencies are the uk pound and the euro  while our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of our uk and ireland subsidiaries have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average rates for the respective years 
exchange gains and losses on translation of our net equity investments in our subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in the statements of operations 
fixed assets fixed assets  net  totaled  million and  million  representing and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
fixed assets  net at december   are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
in accordance with sop  upon our emergence from chapter reorganization  we adopted fresh start reporting as of january  pursuant to fresh start reporting  the carrying values of our fixed assets were adjusted to their reorganization values  which were equivalent to their estimated fair values 
these adjusted carrying values became the revised cost basis of our fixed assets at january  fixed assets  net were written down by  million to reflect this adjustment 
fixed assets acquired since january   are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of fixed assets includes amounts capitalized for labor and overhead expended in connection with the design and installation of our operating network equipment and facilities 
costs associated with initial customer installations  additions of network equipment necessary to enable advanced services  acquisition of additional fixed assets and replacement of existing fixed assets are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgements and the use of estimates 
our managers use their experience and expertise in applying judgements about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  costs are capitalized based upon estimated allocations 
we are continuing to enhance our processes to reduce reliance upon these estimates in determining amounts capitalized 
the labor and overhead costs capitalized in the year ended december  was approximately million  or million  in the year ended december  was approximately million  or million  and in the year ended december  was approximately million  or million 
the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position on accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment dated june  this exposure draft has not yet been adopted 
however  if this exposure draft were adopted  it would require that all rent and other occupancy costs  including those related to construction and installation of fixed assets  be charged to expense as incurred 
in the years ended december  and  we capitalized approximately million  or million  and approximately million  or million  respectively  of rent and other occupancy costs 
the following table illustrates the calculation of labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of total operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses and as a percentage of cash used to purchase fixed assets 
year ended december  reorganized company predecessor company predecessor company in millions labor and overhead costs capitalized total operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of total operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses purchase of fixed assets  labor and overhead costs capitalized as a percentage of purchase of fixed assets impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets  including fixed assets and amortizable definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  by first grouping our long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
we estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we determine fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analysis of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets  goodwill  license acquisition costs and other intangible assets that are not amortized are reviewed for impairment each year 
as of december   we reviewed our long lived assets for impairment 
we engaged an independent financial adviser to assist in the impairment review 
the independent financial adviser and we determined that there was no impairment of our long lived assets as of december  this determination was based upon various valuation methods  including discounted cash flow analysis  selected comparable market multiples of publicly traded companies and other applicable ratios and economic information relevant to our operations 
certain factors that were incorporated into the impairment review included the following reporting unit year cash flow projections 
corporate income tax rates of in the uk and in ireland 
present value discount factors of between and depending upon the reporting unit 
residual value representing the sum of the value beyond years into perpetuity calculated using the gordon growth model 
our assessments of impairment of long lived assets and our periodic review of the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets are an integral part of our ongoing strategic review of the business and operations 
future changes in our strategy and other changes in our operations could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in our estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
revenue we recognize revenue only when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and our customers  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price for the service is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle  and are recognized as the services are provided 
at the end of each period  adjustments are recorded to defer revenue relating to services billed in advance and to accrue for earned but unbilled services 
telephone service and cable television revenues are recognized as the services are provided to customers 
rental revenue in respect of line rentals and rental of equipment provided to customers is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement 
internet revenue in respect of broadband services provided to customers is recognized as the service is provided 
bundled services revenue is recognized at the time the services are provided to the customer or the performance of all of the services have been completed 
we apply the provisions of eitf no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to assess whether the components of the bundled services should be recognized separately 
transmission and other ntl broadcast revenues are recognized as the service is provided over the life of the contract 
carrier revenues in respect of national and international communication transport services are recognized as the service is provided 
installation revenues are recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that those fees are less than direct selling costs 
installation fees in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
financial reporting by cable television companies in relation to connection and activation fees for telephone service and internet services  as well as cable television services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
pensions we account for our defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and the disclosure rules under sfas no 
revised employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements  and under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of million and million in and  respectively 
we expect our pension expense to be approximately million in the calculation of pension expense and our pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
when calculating pension expense for  we assumed that plan assets would generate a long term rate of return of between and 
this range is lower than the assumed rates of between and used to calculate the expense 
we determine our expected long term rate of return assumption based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans assets  including the trustee s review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the plan strives to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we discounted our future pension obligations using rates of between and at december  and rates of between and for we determined the appropriate discount rate based on the current rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by would increase our pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
at december   projected benefit obligations of all of our pension plans exceed plan assets by million 
we will need to fund these deficits in accordance with the laws and regulations of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland 
we expect to contribute a total of approximately million million during  of which million million relates to the largest of our defined benefit pension plans 
other policies we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and other receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make payments 
these allowances are estimated based on the current aging of receivables  prior collection experience and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additions to the allowances may be required 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on a view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
we consult legal counsel on matters related to litigation 
we consult both internal and external experts with respect to other matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
examples of these matters that are based on assumptions  judgments and estimates include amounts to be paid to terminate some agreements included in restructuring charges and the amounts to be paid to settle some other liabilities 
a liability is accrued if the likelihood of occurrence of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is capable of estimation 
we incur interconnection and related costs from other carriers relating to the provision of telephone services 
these carriers can make retrospective adjustments to charges for these services which requires us to estimate certain charges for a particular period 
actual charges may differ from those estimated 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
consolidated results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   consolidated revenues increased by to  million from  million in revenues expressed in uk pounds increased by to  million from  million 
revenues in our ntl home segment increased by million driven by an increase in broadband internet services and additional customers 
revenues in ntl ireland rose by million owing primarily to price increases  more dtv customers and higher business sector revenues 
revenues in our ntl broadcast segment increased by million owing primarily to higher revenues from radio communications services to the public safety sector 
these increases were offset by a decline of million in revenues in our ntl business segment  primarily owing to fewer customers  and a decline of million in revenues in our ntl carriers segment  primarily because of the downturn in the market for wholesale telecommunications services 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from  million in  and operating costs expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from  million 
operating costs as a percentage of revenues declined to for the year ended december   from for the decrease in operating costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily a result of reductions in television programming costs because of renegotiated contracts  which included expanded channel line ups  and in telephone interconnection costs as a result of our effort to route our outbound traffic more effectively and the recent oftel ruling related to mobile interconnect cost reductions 
these savings were principally attributable to our ntl home segment 
in addition  we have experienced lower costs within our ntl business segment as we continue to focus on a smaller but more profitable customer base 
we have also benefited from a release of certain accruals in respect of the favorable resolution of billing matters with certain providers of interconnect related services in ntl home and ntl business 
finally  we benefited from a reduction in charges from local authorities in respect of rates payable on our network principally in ntl home 
these reductions have been partly offset by the expensing of costs that are no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized  together with the impact of the release of certain balance sheet provisions in which were not repeated in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in  and selling  general and administrative expenses expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december   from for the increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher marketing and selling activities in  principally within ntl home  which were curtailed in as a result of our reorganization 
in addition  employee costs associated with incentive compensation plans increased in compared with these include increased bonus costs as a result of performance achievements above target  introduction of a long term incentive plan  and the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
also  contributing are increased pension costs in respect of our defined benefit schemes 
finally  as set forth above  selling  general and administrative costs have increased because of the expensing of costs that are no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized  and the release of certain balance sheet provisions in as discussed below which were not repeated in these increases have been offset by savings arising from our successful renegotiation of our contract with ibm for outsourced it services  together with reduced employee costs in ntl business as a result of the restructuring at the end of and during in addition  we have also benefited from reduced ntl home costs through lower allowances for doubtful accounts and other operational savings  together with reduced property and facility costs in our shared services division 
other charges other charges of million for the year ended december   include million relating to restructuring charges for employee severance and related costs and million in respect of professional fees 
restructuring charges of million comprised new charges of million less releases of million in respect of provisions no longer required 
the net charges were incurred in respect of approximately employees who were made redundant or terminated in the year ended december   all of whom ceased employment by december  other charges of million in the year ended december  include restructuring charges of million and non cash charges of million  primarily for allowances for the cancellation of receivables from our former parent company and some of its subsidiaries in accordance with our restructuring under chapter restructuring charges of million in relate to our actions to reorganize  re size and reduce operating costs and create greater efficiency in various areas 
an aggregate of million of the restructuring charges were for the write off of equipment and other assets that are not in use and will not require any future cash outlays 
employee severance and related costs in were related to approximately employees to be terminated  of which approximately employees were still employed by us as of december   but who were terminated by december  the following table summarizes the restructuring charges incurred and utilized in and in millions employee severance and related costs lease exit costs agreement modifications other total balance  december  released charged to expense utilized balance  december  foreign currency exchange translation adjustments released charged to expense utilized balance  december  depreciation expense for the year ended december   depreciation expense decreased to  million from  million in  primarily as a result of the  million decrease in the carrying value of fixed assets subject to depreciation effective january  this decrease in carrying value of fixed assets was because of the adoption of fresh start reporting  which included a reassessment of the remaining useful lives of these assets 
amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense increased to million from million in this increase in amortization expense was as a result of the  million increase in the carrying value of our customer lists as of january  because of the adoption of fresh start reporting  and which are being amortized over to years 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to million from million in  primarily as a result of the cancellation of  million of debt on january  in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization 
in the year ended december   interest expense included interest on this debt only through to may  pursuant to sop  in the period from may  to december   interest expense was included in the results of operations only to the extent that it would be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding or that it was probable that it would be an allowed priority  secured or unsecured claim 
accordingly  interest expense for the year ended december  excluded million of contractual interest 
the saving in interest from the cancellation of debt on january  was partly offset by interest on the exit notes issued in january through to november when they were repaid  accretion charges in respect of fresh start adjustments to the carrying values of diamond holdings and ntl triangle notes  adverse movements in exchange rates causing the us dollar equivalent of our uk pound interest expense to increase  the amendment and restatement of our senior and working capital credit facilities in january  that increased the rate of interest payable on these facilities  the amortization of certain costs incurred in connection with this amendment to the senior and working credit facilities  and a reduction in the amount of interest capitalized in we paid interest in cash of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  with respect to the interest payment of million on the exit notes due on july   we elected to pay the interest through the issuance of additional pay in kind notes 
we issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of exit notes with primarily the same terms as the original exit notes for the interest payment 
recapitalization expense for the year ended december  we had no recapitalization expense 
for the year ended december   recapitalization expense was million 
recapitalization expense included all transactions incurred as a result of our chapter reorganization 
this expense included million for employee retention related to substantially all of our uk employees and million for financial advisory  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
foreign currency transaction gains losses our principal operating functional currencies are the uk pound and the euro  while our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of our uk and ireland subsidiaries have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average rates for the respective years 
exchange gains and losses on translation of our net equity investment in our subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   foreign currency transaction gains were million as compared with losses of million for these gains in were primarily because of the effect of changes in exchange rates on us dollar denominated debt of our subsidiaries  diamond holdings and ntl triangle  whose functional currency is the uk pound 
our results of operations will continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
income tax benefit expense for the year ended december   income tax expense was million as compared with income tax benefit of million in the expense is composed of million in us state and local income tax expense less million of deferred non us income tax benefit 
none of the income tax  except a portion of the state and local tax  is expected to be payable in the next year 
net loss for the year ended december   net loss was million as compared with a net loss of  million in the reduction in net loss is attributable to our improved operating performance  a reduction in depreciation expense because of our lower tangible fixed asset cost  a reduction in restructuring charges for employee severance  foreign currency gains in but losses in  and the occurrence in of items that were not repeated in  including long lived asset impairments  an allowance for the cancellation of receivables from our former parent company and some of its subsidiaries and recapitalization expense relating to our reorganization under chapter net loss per share basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  was and for the year ended december  was 
basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  is computed assuming the following shares were outstanding for these years million shares issued in connection with the plan  million shares issued in connection with the issuance of the exit notes and million shares as an adjustment to give effect to the impact of the rights offering 
segment profit loss ntl home 
for the year ended december   ntl home revenues increased by to  million from  million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds increased by to  million from  million 
this was primarily a result of more customers subscribing to our broadband internet services  an increase in our customer base  and the impact of price increases for our broadband internet services and our cable television services 
we also increased our revenues from our wholesale internet access services through arrangements with other uk isps 
these increases were partly offset by a reduction in our off net revenues  primarily due to the cessation in the fourth quarter of of transition billing and other related services provided to the purchaser of the consumerco off net indirect access business which we sold in november for the year ended december   ntl home segment profit increased by to  million from million for  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
this increase is primarily associated with higher revenues together with reductions in our cable television program costs as a result of renegotiated contracts with content providers  which included expanded channel line ups  and in our telephone interconnect costs 
interconnect cost reductions resulted from our effort to route our outbound telephony traffic more effectively and from oftel mandated reductions in mobile interconnect rates 
in addition further operational efficiencies and cost cutting including lower allowances for doubtful accounts owing to improved collection procedures  together with a reduction in amounts previously charged by local authorities in respect of rates payable on our network  have increased ntl home segment profit in the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of we also benefited from a release of certain accruals in respect of the favorable resolution of billing matters with certain providers of interconnect related services 
these cost reductions have been partly offset by the expensing of costs that are no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized 
in addition increased sales and marketing costs  including related employee costs  have further reduced segment profit 
these sales and marketing activities had been curtailed in as a result of our chapter reorganization 
other employee costs have also increased  partly because of increased bonus costs due to performance achievements above target  and partly because of the introduction of a long term incentive plan in ntl business 
for the year ended december   ntl business revenues decreased by to million from million in  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million 
this decrease was primarily because of fewer customers  major installations and orders as we executed our strategy of focusing on a smaller but more profitable customer base 
this decrease in revenues was offset to some extent by our selling of additional services to our existing customers 
we expect to return our focus towards targeted profitable customer acquisitions in initiatives are expected to include the recruitment of a new sales team which will focus on winning new medium and large customers  and investigation and implementation of new indirect sales channels 
for the year ended december   ntl business segment profit increased by to million from million in  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
this increase was primarily a result of reduced employee costs following a substantial organizational restructuring of ntl business at the end of and during  together with the impact of further operational efficiencies and cost cutting 
in addition we benefited from a release of certain accruals in respect of the favorable resolution of billing matters with certain providers of interconnect related services  together with a reduction in amounts charged by bt in respect of other interconnect services 
the reductions in revenue described above did not have a material impact on segment profit because of the low profitability of these revenue streams 
these increases in segment profit have been partially offset by the expensing of costs that are no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized 
ntl broadcast 
for the year ended december   ntl broadcast revenues increased by to million from million in  and revenues expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
this was primarily a result of higher revenues from delivery of radio communications services to the public safety sector 
these arose principally from managed service contracts with six uk county police forces for the migration from analog to digital communication systems together with the supply of radio equipment and associated project and technical labor to the metropolitan police 
we also generated additional revenues from the continued rollout of digital radio services and increases in site sharing  together with termination payments from two satellite distribution services contracts amounting to approximately million 
these increases in revenues were partly offset by reduced media revenues because of a downturn in this market especially in the satellite distribution services sector  the slowing down of installation services for cellular network rollouts  the termination of a contract to provide television program scheduling and transmission services  and the slowing down of public safety maintenance services 
for the year ended december   ntl broadcast segment profit increased by to million from million in  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
this was primarily as a result of the increased revenues described above together with savings in employee costs following the reorganization of certain activities within the broadcast services and public safety business units 
ntl carriers 
for the year ended december   ntl carriers revenues increased by to million from million in  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million 
the primary reason for this decline in revenues as expressed in uk pounds is excess capacity in the carriers market that adversely affected pricing during and hampered our ability to obtain new business 
in addition  during the year ended december   ntl carriers was able to recognize some revenues  which had previously been deferred  as a result of the insolvency of certain customers which released us from our obligations under our contracts with them 
these revenues were not repeated for the year ended december  the decline in revenues as expressed in uk pounds from carrier services has been partially offset by increased revenues from mobile telecommunications operators 
for the year ended december   ntl carriers segment profit increased by to million from million in  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million 
this decrease in segment profit as expressed in uk pounds was primarily owing to the decline in revenues as expressed in uk pounds 
ntl ireland 
for the year ended december   ntl ireland revenues increased by to million from million in  revenues expressed in uk pounds increased to million from million  and revenues expressed in euros increased by to million from million 
the primary reasons for the increase were more sales of premium services  including digital television  to existing customers  a price increase that became effective in january  and higher business sector revenues 
for the year ended december   ntl ireland segment profit increased by to million from million in  segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million  and segment profit expressed in euros increased by to million from million 
this was primarily owing to revenue growth together with a reduction in our bad debt charge as a result of our more rigorous credit policy 
in addition during the year ended december   we continued to focus on reducing our operating costs and also successfully renegotiated our contract with ibm for outsourced it services  which resulted in a reduction in rates charged 
these costs reductions have been partly offset by increased employee costs including bonuses and the expensing of costs that are no longer applicable to capital activities and therefore no longer capitalized 
ntl shared services 
for the year ended december   ntl shared services loss increased by to million from million in  and the loss expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million 
this is primarily owing to increases in our pension fund charges arising from the annual actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans during the fourth quarter of together with increased employee related costs 
additional employee related costs include increased bonus charges due to performance achievements above target  introduction of a long term incentive scheme  stock option compensation arising from our adoption of sfas no 
 and other stock compensation expense 
finally  releases of certain balance sheet provisions in as discussed below were not repeated in these increases in shared services loss have been partly offset by savings resulting from the re negotiation of our contract with ibm for outsourced it services in the third quarter of in addition  for the year ended december   we reduced our property and related facility costs through further property rationalization and negotiated savings on our facility contracts compared with we reduced network maintenance and related costs  and we reduced our healthcare costs from the higher levels experienced during the year ended december  which were a result of increased claims following the significant employee redundancies announced during the fourth quarter of years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   consolidated revenues increased by to  million from  million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased by to  million from  million during the same period 
this was primarily a result of the negative impact that uncertainties arising from our chapter reorganization had on our revenues in ntl business  together with a reduction in revenue following the sale of the consumerco off net indirect access telephone business in ntl home in the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by increases in revenues in ntl broadcast and ntl ireland 
expenses a review of a number of our balance sheet accounts during found that some provisions that were being held against anticipated liabilities were no longer necessary 
the release of these provisions resulted in a decrease in operating costs of million  or million  and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expense of million  or million 
in addition  in we engaged in a process of reducing our expenditures in a variety of areas including customer acquisitions and expenditures relating to certain capital improvements 
these measures  as well as the restructuring of our operations in  which resulted in significant headcount reductions and departmental reorganizations  caused us to reassess whether for certain expenditures  assumptions related to the allocation of those costs between capital and operating expenses needed to be revised 
this review was completed in the fourth quarter  resulting in a million million increase in operating expenses and a million million increase in selling  general and administrative expense and the corresponding reduction in fixed assets of million million in the three months ended december  there was no impact on cash in from either of these adjustments 
these two adjustments relate principally to periods prior to the three months ended december  for the first  second and third quarters of  operating expenses would increase by approximately million per quarter and selling  general and administrative expense would increase by approximately million per quarter if the reallocation of the million from capitalized costs to expense was reflected in the appropriate periods 
the million net adjustment would not be reallocated to the first  second and third quarters of because these provisions related to periods prior to operating expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  including network expenses  decreased by to  million from  million for  and expenses expressed in uk pounds decreased to  million from  million during the same period 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to for the year ended december  from for in addition to the release of provisions explained above  this decrease in operating expenses was primarily a result of decreases in telephone interconnection costs by improving the routing of our outbound traffic  and decreases in television programming costs due to renegotiated contracts which included expanded channel line ups 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million from million for  and expenses expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million during the same period 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for this primarily reflects decreases in employee related costs and sales and marketing expenses following various cost savings efforts  including restructurings that were announced in the third and fourth quarters of  together with the release of provisions explained above 
asset impairments asset impairment charges were million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december  asset impairment charges of million in are non cash charges to write down some assets to their estimated fair values based on our assessment that their carrying value was not recoverable 
these charges in included charges against fixed assets of million  license acquisition costs of million and goodwill of million 
the charge with respect to fixed assets was estimated based upon the technological obsolescence of some network and other equipment 
the charge with respect to license acquisition costs and goodwill was determined in accordance with sfas no 
asset impairment charges of  million in included goodwill of  million  license acquisition costs of million  customer lists of million and other intangibles of million 
non cash compensation non cash compensation of million in the year ended december  was due to modifications to some stock options approved by the compensation and option committee of the board of directors of our former parent company in july all options to purchase shares of our former parent company s common stock were cancelled on january  pursuant to the plan

other charges of million in the year ended december  include restructuring charges of million and costs of million incurred primarily to integrate acquired companies  mostly related to information technology integration as well as costs incurred for business rationalization consulting 
restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  relate to our actions to reorganize  re size and reduce operating costs and create greater efficiency in various areas 
an aggregate of million of the restructuring charges and million of the restructuring charges were for the write off of equipment and other assets that are not in use and will not require any future cash outlays 
employee severance and related costs in were related to approximately  employees to be terminated  of which approximately employees were still employed by us as of december  these costs in were related to approximately employees to be terminated  of which approximately employees were still employed by us as of december   but who were all terminated by december  the following table summarizes the restructuring charges incurred and utilized in and in millions employee severance and related costs lease exit costs agreement modifications fixed assets other total balance  december  provision utilized provision released charged to expense provision utilized balance  december  provision utilied provision utilized provision released charged to expense provision utilized balance  december  depreciation depreciation expense increased to  million in from  million in primarily due to an increase in depreciation of telecommunications and cable television equipment due to purchases of fixed assets during amortization amortization expense decreased to million in from  million in due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
ended the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
amortization expense in the year ended december   after deducting the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of  million  would have been million but for the application of sfas no 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in from  million in as a result of the application of sop pursuant to sop  interest expense is included in the results of operations only to the extent that it will be paid during the bankruptcy proceeding or that it is probable that it will be an allowed priority  secured or unsecured claim 
in accordance with sop  we did not recognize interest expense on some of our outstanding publicly traded notes on or after may   the date some of our subsidiaries and we filed our plan of reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
our contractual interest for the year ended december  was  million 
the increase in contractual interest expense in as compared with is primarily due to additional borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of new notes in interest of million was paid in cash in the year ended december  and interest of million was paid in cash in the year ended december  other losses other losses of million in are from the sale in the fourth quarter of of the consumerco off net indirect access business  which served customers not directly connected to our network 
foreign currency gains losses our principal operating functional currencies are the uk pound and the euro  while our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of our uk and ireland subsidiaries have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  and revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average rates for the respective years 
exchange gains and losses on translation of our net equity investment in our subsidiaries are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
foreign currency transaction losses were million in the year ended december  compared with foreign currency gains of million in the year ended december  the change was primarily owing to the appreciation of the dollar against uk pounds 
recapitalization expense recapitalization expense was million in the year ended december  recapitalization expense includes all transactions incurred as a result of our chapter reorganization 
recapitalization expense includes million for employee retention related to substantially all of our uk employees and million for financial advisory  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit in of million related to a reduction of million in state and local income tax and a reduction of million in deferred tax liabilities attributable to foreign subsidiaries 
income tax expense in of million included an adjustment related to through of approximately million that is primarily attributable to additional tax depreciation being claimed during on original and amended income tax returns 
net loss net loss was  million in the year ended december  and  million in the year ended december  this change was the result of the factors discussed above 
segment profit loss ntl home 
for the year ended december   ntl home revenues increased by to  million from  million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased by to  million from  million during the same period 
this was primarily a result of the sale of the consumerco off net indirect access business in november that accounted for approximately million of consolidated revenues in the year ended december  during  ntl home placed more focus on retention of existing customers and curtailed its spending on acquisition of new customers 
consequently  the customer base declined during  leading to lower revenues 
the effect of this decrease in customers was partially offset by price increases and an increase in the number of customers subscribing to our broadband internet services 
for the year ended december   ntl home segment profit increased by to million from million for  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million during the same period 
this was primarily due to reductions in ntl home s expenses which offset the decreases in revenues resulting in an increase in segment profit margin from in to in these expenses decreased primarily due to changes in the mix of our revenues towards services with lower marginal costs  combined with savings in our television programming costs and telephone interconnect costs 
we increased the number of customers subscribing to our broadband internet services although this increase was partially offset by reductions in the number of customers subscribing to cable television and telephone services from us 
finally  segment profit was also adversely affected by the sale of the consumerco off net indirect access business in the fourth quarter of by approximately million 
in addition  lower employee related costs following our organizational restructuring in the fourth quarter of  together with further operational efficiencies and cost cutting  including a reduction in our sales and marketing costs  resulted in lower expenses in compared with ntl business 
for the year ended december   ntl business revenues decreased by to million from million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million during the same period 
this was primarily the result of uncertainties arising from our chapter reorganization activities in  together with our decision to stop selling a number of our less profitable products 
for the year ended december   ntl business segment profit decreased by to million from million for  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million during the same period 
the main reason for this decline was the decrease in ntl business revenues  partly offset by lower expenses principally due to lower employee costs following our organizational restructuring during  together with the impact of further operational efficiencies and cost cutting 
ntl broadcast 
for the year ended december   ntl broadcast revenues increased by to million from million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million during the same period 
this was primarily a result of an increase in digital radio rollout and additional project revenues 
in addition  strong demand for tower site rental was sustained throughout from all five major mobile operators  resulting in a further increase in revenues 
for the year ended december   ntl broadcast segment profit increased by to million from million for  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million during the same period 
this was primarily a result of increased revenues 
ntl carriers 
for the year ended december   ntl carriers revenues decreased marginally to million from million for  and revenues expressed in uk pounds decreased to million from million during the same period 
this decline was largely a result of a significant downturn in the carrier market  partially offset by growth in the mobile market 
for the year ended december   ntl carriers segment profit increased by to million from million for  and segment profit expressed in uk pounds decreased by to million from million during the same period 
this small decrease was primarily due to the fall in revenues

for the year ended december   ntl ireland revenues increased by to million from million for the same period of  revenues expressed in uk pounds increased by to million from million during the same period  and revenues expressed in euros increased by to million from million during the same period

ntl shared services 
for the year ended december   ntl shared services loss decreased by to million from million for  and loss expressed in uk pounds decreased to million from million during the same period 
this was primarily due to lower employee related costs and other operational efficiencies and cost savings 
statement of cash flows year ended december  and for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million in  because of the improvement in operating results 
for the year ended december   cash paid for interest  exclusive of amounts capitalized  increased to million from million in primarily as a result of our resumption of payment of interest due on our outstanding debt when we emerged from bankruptcy on january  these payments were suspended during our reorganization process 
in addition  the amendment and restatement of our senior and working capital credit facilities in january increased the rate of interest and unfavorable movements in exchange rates increased the us dollar equivalent of our uk pound debt interest payments 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities decreased to million from million in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   included million of restricted cash drawn under the dip facility 
see our restructuring 
the dip facility was repaid on the effective date of our reorganization from chapter purchases of fixed assets for the year ended december   which are primarily related to customer premise equipment  were lower than in during  we continued to restrict purchases of fixed assets in an effort to conserve cash 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million cash provided for the year ended december  the principal components of the million cash provided by financing activities in were as follows on november   we completed a rights offering  we received gross proceeds of  million and approximately  million after expenses from the exercise of rights  and from the proceeds of the rights offering  we repaid in full all our obligations under our exit notes of million and  together with cash on hand  our working capital credit facility of million 
we also made principal payments on some of our capital leases 
the principal components of the million cash provided in were as follows proceeds from borrowings  net of financing costs  of million  which included million borrowed under our working capital facility  net of costs of million  and million borrowed under our dip facility  net of costs of million  and proceeds from borrowings from ntl delaware of million comprising the million loan to our subsidiary ntl uk group  inc this note was purchased on january  pursuant to the reorganization from chapter by one of our subsidiaries for cash consideration equal to the principal amount of the note plus accrued interest 
year ended december  and cash provided by used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  cash paid for interest  exclusive of amounts capitalized  was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the change in cash provided by used in operating activities is due to changes in working capital as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements including the suspension of various payments due to our reorganization 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities primarily includes cash used for purchases of fixed assets and acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
purchases of fixed assets were million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december  as a result of continuing fixed asset purchases and network construction 
we continue to restrict purchases of fixed assets in in an effort to conserve cash 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  also included cash used for a loan to our former parent company of million 
on september   we loaned our former parent company million in exchange for promissory notes due september  interest was payable monthly in cash at a rate of per annum beginning on october  these notes were cancelled pursuant to the plan 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december  proceeds from borrowings from ntl delaware of million for the year ended december  is the million loan to ntl uk group  inc this note was purchased by one of our subsidiaries for consideration equal to the principal amount of the note plus accrued interest on the effective date of the plan

these notes were cancelled pursuant to the plan 
principal payments of million for the year ended december  include optional repayments of million under the ntl communications limited credit agreements and repayments of an aggregate of million of other debt 
cash provided by financing activities also includes contributions from our former parent company ntl delaware of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive  we are highly leveraged  and we have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flow 
we require significant amounts of capital to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network  offer new services and integrate our billing systems and customer databases 
we must regularly service interest payments with cash flows from operations and we have over billion of principal payments and contractual commitments coming due over the next three years 
our ability to sustain operations  meet financial covenants under our indebtedness  obtain additional capital and make required payments on our indebtedness could be impaired if we are unable to maintain or achieve various financial performance measures 
on november   we declared a non cash dividend to stockholders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on november   at no charge  of transferable rights for each share of our common stock they hold on the record date 
each right entitled stockholders to purchase one share at a purchase price of 
the rights offering period expired on november  in connection with the rights offering  we issued  shares and received gross proceeds of  million 
we used the net proceeds of approximately  million to repay in full all obligations under our exit notes and  together with cash on hand  our working capital facility 
in addition  we used the net proceeds as inter company funding to one of our subsidiaries and the balance for general corporate expenses 
historically  we have been unable to obtain positive cash flow  partly as a result of our construction costs  operating expenditures and interest costs 
we have also incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial losses 
during the period after we emerged from our chapter reorganization until the completion of the rights offering  we funded ourselves primarily with the proceeds of borrowings from the exit notes  our working capital facility and our senior credit facility 
for the period of january  through march   we expect to spend between million and million  or between million and million  on acquiring fixed assets 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through march however  our cash requirements after march   may exceed  perhaps significantly  these sources of cash 
this may require that we obtain financing in excess of the proposed refinancing we are currently negotiating 
see recent developments 
we may not be able to obtain financing at all  or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of our current or proposed indebtedness from incurring additional indebtedness 
beginning in  a series of principal payments and other contractual commitments come due  including on september  the principal under the revolving facility of our senior credit facility 
as of december   the principal amount outstanding under this facility was  million  or  million 
we currently do not have adequate cash flow to fund these requirements 
consequently  we anticipate funding these requirements through refinancing in the debt markets 
we are currently seeking to take advantage of favorable market conditions in connection with our refinancing needs 
see business recent developments 
if our proposed refinancing fails  we may seek to amend the terms of our existing credit facilities  including extending their maturities 
additionally  we may seek liquidity in the equity markets 
if we were to issue additional equity  there could be a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
there can be no assurance that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or that any covenants in any new debt will not be more restrictive than the covenants under our existing debt 
to the extent we raise additional capital  market considerations may require us to seek financing denominated in us dollars  further exposing us to currency exchange risks 
to the extent that the uk pound declines in value against the us dollar  it will become more difficult for us to service this us dollar debt 
the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness significantly restrict and  in some cases  prohibit our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  create or incur liens  pay dividends or make other equity distributions  engage in or make some payments under inter company arrangements  purchase or redeem share capital  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts by our subsidiaries  make investments  sell assets  issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries  engage in transactions with affiliates  and effect a merger or consolidation  or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our subsidiaries and we are obligated to comply with various financial covenants that require our subsidiaries and us to meet and maintain specified financial performance measures and ratios 
these covenants set targets related to liquidity  coverage and leverage ratios 
these ratios are not publicly reported and depend on measures like derivatives of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
the definition of ebitda included in our senior credit and working capital facilities includes various adjustments to that measure for the purposes of these agreements 
ebitda as so defined is not a measure that is reported in our financial statements 
with respect to our senior credit and working capital facilities  these ratios are tested quarterly 
over time  these ratios change to become more restrictive 
although as a result of the rights offering  debt levels and total charges have decreased  our compliance is still heavily dependent on our ability to maintain the ebitda and other performance measures defined in these agreements 
in particular  our ability to maintain ratios that are based on earnings or cash flows will depend on our business performance  which may be influenced by factors outside our control 
in the event that we fail to meet any of these covenants and we are unable to cure the failure or otherwise renegotiate the covenant  the lenders under those agreements would have significant rights to seize control of most of our assets because these agreements are secured by liens on most of our assets or to accelerate payment under our debt facilities 
also  a default under one debt agreement could trigger a default under our other debt agreements 
our debt and the debt of some of our subsidiaries contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
this debt includes the senior credit facility  the senior discount debentures of ntl triangle  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours  referred to as the triangle notes  and the senior notes and the senior sterling notes of diamond holdings  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ours  referred to as the diamond notes 
the triangle notes and diamond notes are described more fully below 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our indebtedness from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements 
we are a holding company with no independent operations or significant assets other than our investments in and advances to our subsidiaries 
as a result  we depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
in addition  the terms of our subsidiaries and our existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which those subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions to us under many circumstances 
at december   all of our defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations exceeding plan assets totaling million 
we will need to fund these deficits in accordance with the laws and regulations of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland 
we expect to contribute a total of approximately million million in  of which million million relates to the largest of our defined benefit pension plans 
during the year ended december   we received an actuarial valuation as of december   of the largest of our defined benefit pension plans  which represented approximately of total plan assets and of total projected benefit obligations at december  based upon this actuarial valuation of the assets as of the valuation date of december   this plan has a projected benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of plan assets by approximately million  or million 
we will need to fund this deficit in accordance with the laws and regulations of the united kingdom 
we will need to contribute approximately million million in cash payments annually beginning january   and must increase this contribution by for each succeeding year for a period of eleven and one half years in order to eliminate the current deficit 
the actuarial valuation of our pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions may differ from those used in calculating the amounts required to be disclosed in accordance with sfas no 
changes in these assumptions and estimates as well as future investment returns could potentially have a material impact  either upwards or downwards  on the estimated funding requirement 
description of outstanding indebtedness the terms of the significant notes and credit facilities issued by our subsidiaries and us are summarized below 
senior credit facility this facility was fully drawn as of december  the principal amount outstanding is  million  or  million 
our senior credit facility is comprised of a revolving facility of  million  or  million  and a term facility of million  or million

use of non gaap financial measures the presentation of this supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the following reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures  allow a better understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
combined segment profit is not a financial measure recognized under gaap 
combined segment profit represents our combined earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  long lived asset impairments  non cash compensation  other charges  share of losses from equity investments  other gains losses  foreign currency transaction gains losses and recapitalization expense  for each of our reportable business segments 
this measure is most directly comparable to the gaap financial measure net income loss 
some of the significant limitations associated with the use of combined segment profit as compared with net income loss are that combined segment profit does not consider the amount of required reinvestment in depreciable fixed assets  interest expense  gains or losses on foreign currency transactions  income tax expense or benefit and similar items on our results of operations 
combined segment profit also ignores the impact on our results of operations of items that management believes are not characteristic of our underlying business operations 
we compensate for these limitations by using combined segment profit to measure profit or loss on a combined segmental basis and not to determine our consolidated results of operations 
we believe combined segment profit is helpful for understanding our performance and assessing our prospects for the future  and that it provides useful supplemental information to investors 
in particular  this non gaap financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to net income loss  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare combined segment profit loss with other companies non gaap financial measures that have the same or similar names 
the presentation of this supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap

as a result  the ability of our former parent company and its subsidiaries to access those markets as well as its ability to obtain financing from its bank lenders and equipment suppliers became severely restricted 
in addition  our former parent company and its subsidiaries  including us  had no further funds available  or were unable to draw upon funds under our credit facilities 
as a result of these factors  together with its substantial leverage  on january   our former parent company announced that it had appointed professional advisors to advise on strategic and recapitalization alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet  reduce debt and put an appropriate capital structure in place for its business 
promptly upon obtaining the requisite waivers from the lenders under its credit facilities  in march  our former parent company commenced negotiations with a steering committee of the unofficial committee of its bondholders and the committee s legal and financial advisors 
our former parent company and its subsidiaries failed to make interest payments on some of the outstanding notes starting on april  our former parent company also failed to declare or pay dividends on certain series of its outstanding preferred stock  due to a lack of available surplus under delaware law 
on april   our former parent company announced that it and the unofficial committee of its bondholders had reached an agreement in principle on a comprehensive recapitalization of the former ntl group 
to implement the proposed recapitalization plan  on may   we  our former parent company and certain of our former parent company s other subsidiaries filed cases and a pre arranged joint reorganization plan under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
in connection with the filing  some members of the unofficial creditors committee of bondholders entered into a credit facility agreement  referred to in this form k as the dip facility  committing to provide a wholly owned subsidiary of ours with up to million in new debt financing 
ntl delaware committed to provide up to an additional million to us under the dip facility 
as a result of the payment defaults as well as the voluntary filing under chapter by our former parent company and certain of its subsidiaries on may   there was an event of default under all of our former parent company s and its subsidiaries principal credit facilities and the indentures governing all of their publicly traded debt  other than debt of ntl triangle 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan on september  during the fall of  our former parent company negotiated with a group of lenders to enter into a new financing arrangement to repay the dip facility  to repay various obligations and to provide liquidity to our subsidiaries and us 
the plan became effective on january   at which time we emerged from chapter reorganization 
in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization  we issued million aggregate principal face amount of the exit notes on january  initial purchasers of the exit notes also purchased  shares of our common stock on that date 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the exit notes and these  shares totaled million 
the proceeds were used in part to repay all amounts outstanding under the dip facility  to purchase from ntl delaware a million note of ntl uk group  inc  one of our subsidiaries  and to repay certain other obligations 
also on january   our lending banks and we amended our existing credit facilities 
fresh start reporting we operated our business as a debtor in possession subject to the jurisdiction of the us bankruptcy court during the period from may  until january  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our emergence from chapter reorganization were prepared in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  or sop in addition  we adopted fresh start reporting upon our emergence from chapter reorganization in accordance with sop for financial reporting purposes  the effects of the completion of the plan as well as adjustments for fresh start reporting have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of january  pursuant to fresh start reporting  a new entity was deemed created for financial reporting purposes 
the carrying values of our assets were adjusted to their reorganization values  which are equivalent to their estimated fair values at january  the carrying values of our liabilities were adjusted to their present values at january  the emergence from chapter and the adoption of fresh start reporting as of january  resulted in the following items of income expense that were recognized on that date in millions january  predecessor company gain on debt discharge  fresh start adoption intangible assets  fresh start adoption long term debt fresh start adoption deferred tax liability fresh start adoption accrued expenses fresh start adoption fixed assets  recapitalization expense net income  pro forma basic and diluted net income per common share pro forma weighted average number of shares recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in pounds and  to a lesser extent  euros  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december   million net of unamortized discount of million  or of our long term debt  net of unamortized discount  was in us dollars 
because the revenues and expenses from our principal operations are denominated primarily in pounds  but we report our financial results in us dollars  our financial results are also impacted by currency fluctuations  which are unrelated to our underlying results of operations 
the aggregate potential increase in our net loss from a hypothetical one percent fall in the us dollar to uk pound exchange rate would have been approximately million for the year ended december  the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt and the amount of future interest payments on variable interest rate debt are subject to interest rate risk
