overview we are one of the leading worldwide independent providers of electronic manufacturing services ems 
we design and manufacture electronic circuit board assemblies and systems for major original equipment manufacturers oems in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
the historical growth of the overall ems industry  which subsided in early to mid consistent with the overall global economic downturn at that time  was driven by the increasing number of oems who were outsourcing their manufacturing requirements 
we anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from oem customers 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand 
table of contents for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated financial statements 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income 
see factors affecting future results we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations and note n summary of significant accounting policies comprehensive income to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  
table of contents reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see factors affecting future results because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenue for fiscal year increased percent to billion compared to billion for fiscal year our sales levels during fiscal year improved across all industry sectors  demonstrating our continued trend of industry sector and customer diversification 
the increase in our net revenue base year over year represents stronger demand from existing programs  as well as organic growth from new and existing customers

fiscal year ended august  august  august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results

days in accounts receivable have increased three days during the three months ended august  primarily as a result of timing of sales 
the days in accounts receivable for 
table of contents the three months ended may  decreased two days primarily as a result of improved collection efforts during that quarter 
the accounts receivable securitization program entered into in february also contributed one day to the decrease for the three months ended may  this securitization program was also the primary reason for the significant decrease in days in accounts receivable during the three months ended february  days in inventory and inventory turns have remained constant during the three months ended august  the five day decrease in days in inventory during the three months ended may  was primarily a result of increased emphasis on inventory management and resulted in the one day increase in inventory turns for that period 
days in accounts payable have increased three days during the three months ended august  primarily as a result of the timing of inventory purchases and payments of accounts payable 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from repair services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
service related revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the 
table of contents impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  principally based on third party valuations  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
for further information on our intangible assets  including goodwill  refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note pension and other postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets are based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
for further discussion related to our income taxes  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles acquisition related charges restructuring and impairment charges operating income other loss income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across all industry sectors 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of consumer products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of networking products  an increase in the sale of automotive products  a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  and a increase in the sale of telecommunications products 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers  acquisitions and organic growth in these industry sectors 
the increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain operations of philips during fiscal year the increase in the instrumentation 
table of contents and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical oems are electing to outsource their production in these areas 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical oems are electing to outsource their production in these areas 
fiscal year ended august  automotive computing and storage consumer instrumentation and medical networking peripherals telecommunications other total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in austria  brazil  belgium  china  hungary  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland and singapore during fiscal year we expect our foreign source revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of net revenue in fiscal year from in fiscal year the percentage decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector  combined with the continued shift of production to lower cost regions 
the mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions also contributed to the decrease 
additionally  we have been awarded a significant amount of new business during fiscal year the level of activity required to integrate new business into our factories typically has a slightly dilutive impact on gross profit during the initial period of production where certain costs are incurred before any corresponding increase in revenues might occur 
as production for the new business increases  the contribution to gross profit typically increases 
the percentage decrease in gross profit for fiscal year versus fiscal year was partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities in previous fiscal years 
in absolute dollars  gross profit for fiscal year increased million versus fiscal year due to the increased revenue base 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to operations acquired during fiscal year and to operations in facilities for which construction was completed during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by million of quarterly cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities 
the decrease as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue base in fiscal year and the cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities 

table of contents r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year but remained at of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended august  and we continued to engage in r d activities at our historical levels 
these activities included design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process  development of new products and products associated with customer design related programs  and new failure analysis techniques 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition related charges

during fiscal year  we incurred million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of quantum  alcatel  valeo  lucent  seagate  philips and nec 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
there were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with geographic production demands of our customers 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year as of august   liabilities related to our restructuring activities totaled approximately million 
approximately million of this total is expected to be paid out within the next twelve months for severance and benefit payments related to the remaining restructuring activities and lease commitment costs 
the remaining balance  consisting of lease commitment costs  is expected to be paid out through august  as a result of the restructuring activities completed through august   we realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately million during fiscal year this cost savings consisted of million reduction in cost of revenue due to a reduction in employee payroll and benefit expense of million and million in depreciation expense  and million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the restructuring programs discussed above and in note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements have allowed us to align our production capacity and shift our geographic footprint to meet current customer requirements 
as a result  particularly in light of emerging increases in customer demand  we currently have no plans for additional material restructuring activities 
however  we continuously evaluate our operations and cost structure relative to general economic conditions  market demands and cost competitiveness  and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers production requirements 
a change in any of these factors could result in additional restructuring and impairment charges in the future 
other loss income 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million loss on the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  which resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the redemption 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of other income related to proceeds received in the first quarter of fiscal year in connection with facility closure costs 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances  partially offset by lower interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily a result of the issuance of our million  seven year  senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which are effectively converted to a variable rate by our interest rate swap 
this increase was partially offset by the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in may see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an income tax benefit of for fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
the amount of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year  and the fact that the income taxes associated with the restructuring charges were calculated using the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred  resulted in an income tax benefit in the prior fiscal year 
in addition  as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased  our effective tax rate  excluding the impact of restructuring charges  has decreased 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in malaysia  china  brazil  poland  ukraine and hungary that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to a increase in production of consumer products  an increase in production of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in production of automotive products  a increase in production of computing and storage products and a increase in production of networking products due to the addition of new customers  acquisitions and organic growth in those industry sectors 
the increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations of philips during fiscal year these increases were offset in part by an decrease in production of telecommunications products due to reduced demand in this industry sector 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in france and scotland during late fiscal year  and our acquisitions in austria  brazil  belgium  china  hungary  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland and singapore during fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit decreased slightly to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and the mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions  partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to operations acquired in late fiscal year and fiscal year and to operations in facilities for which construction was completed during fiscal year the decrease as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue base in fiscal year r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year but remained at of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended august  and despite the economic conditions faced in the respective time period  we continued to engage in r d activities  including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process  development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels

restructuring and impairment charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with customer geographic requirements 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year these restructuring and impairment charges included cash costs totaling million consisting of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
non cash costs of approximately million represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
as of august   liabilities of million related to these restructuring activities were expected to be paid out within the next twelve months and liabilities of million were expected to be paid out through august  the employee severance and benefit costs included in our restructuring and impairment costs recorded in fiscal year were related to the elimination of approximately  employees  the majority of which were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in manufacturing facilities in the united states and europe 
lease commitment costs consisted primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated because of the closure and consolidation of facilities in the united states 
the fixed asset impairment charge resulted from the closure of our boise  idaho and coventry  england facilities  as well as a realignment of our worldwide capacity due to the restructuring activities carried out during fiscal year the production from the boise location was transferred to other existing locations during fiscal year the transfer of production from the coventry location began during the second quarter of fiscal year and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for additional information regarding restructuring costs  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements

these payments were offset slightly by million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under option and employee purchase plans during fiscal year see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations and note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements 
we may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we filed a million shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement  which generated net proceeds of million 
in august  we increased the amount of securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement to billion 
in may  we issued a total of million  year  convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes at par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the convertible notes were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the convertible notes were to mature on may  and pay interest semiannually on may and november under the terms of the convertible notes  the note holders had the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes on may in the years   and at par plus accrued interest 
additionally  we had the right to redeem all or a portion of the convertible notes for cash at any time on or after may  accordingly  the convertible notes were classified as current debt as of august  on may   we paid million par value to certain note holders who exercised their right to require us to purchase their convertible notes 
on may   we paid million par value upon exercise of our right to redeem the remaining convertible notes outstanding 
in addition to the par value of the convertible notes  we paid accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million to the note holders 
as a result of these transactions  we recognized a loss of million on the write off of unamortized issuance costs associated with the convertible notes 
this loss has been recorded as an other loss in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended august  in july  we issued a total of million  seven year  senior notes senior notes at of par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the senior notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the senior notes mature on july  and pay interest semiannually on january and july approximately million of securities remain registered with the sec under our shelf registration statement at august  
table of contents in july  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our senior notes to a variable rate 
the swap  which expires in  is accounted for as a fair value hedge under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas 
the notional amount of the swap is million  which is related to the senior notes 
under the terms of the swap  we will pay an interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor rate  set in arrears  plus a fixed spread of 
in exchange  we will receive a fixed rate of 
at august   million has been recorded in other long term liabilities to record the fair value of the interest rate swap  with a corresponding decrease to the carrying value of the senior notes on the consolidated balance sheet 
on may   we negotiated a six month  billion japanese yen jpy approximately million based on currency exchange rates at the time credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest accrued on outstanding borrowings based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor plus a spread of 
the credit facility was to expire on december  and any outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed billion jpy on this facility 
the cash proceeds  which translated to million based on foreign currency rates in effect at the date of the borrowing  were used to partially fund the acquisition of certain operations of nec in gotemba  japan 
on august   we renegotiated the billion jpy credit facility by converting it into a five year term loan japan term loan  with the final principal payment due may  we pay interest on the japan term loan quarterly at a fixed annual rate of 
the japan term loan requires quarterly repayments of principal of million jpy 
the japan term loan requires compliance with financial and operating covenants including maintaining a minimum equity balance at the respective subsidiary level 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  on may   we negotiated a six month  billion jpy approximately million based on currency exchange rates at august  credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
the facility was to expire on december  during the first quarter of fiscal year we renewed this existing facility for a term of one year 
under the terms of the facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on tibor plus a spread of 
the credit facility expires on december  and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
we plan to renew this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
on july   we amended and revised our then existing three year  million revolving credit facility  cancelled our then existing day  million credit facility and established a three year  million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the amended revolver 
under the terms of the amended revolver  borrowings can be made under either floating rate loans or eurodollar rate loans 
we pay interest on outstanding floating rate loans at the greater of the agent s prime rate or plus the federal funds rate 
we pay interest on outstanding eurodollar loans at the libor in effect at the loan inception plus a spread of to 
we pay a facility fee based on the committed amount of the amended revolver at a rate equal to to 
we also pay a usage fee if our borrowings on the amended revolver exceed of the aggregate commitment 
the usage fee rate ranges from to 
the interest spread  facility fee and usage fee are determined based on our general corporate rating or rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness as determined by standard and poor s rating service and moody s investor service 
as of august   the interest spread on the amended revolver was 
the amended revolver expires on july  and outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
the amended revolver requires compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to ebitda ratio  as defined in the amended revolver 
the amended revolver requires compliance with certain operating covenants  which limit  among other things  our incurrence of additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding on the amended revolver 

table of contents on february   we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank  which originally provided for the sale at any one time of up to million of eligible accounts receivable of certain domestic operations 
as a result of an amendment in april  the program was increased to up to million at any one time 
under this agreement  we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit  administered by an unaffiliated financial institution 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit 
as the receivables sold are collected  we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreement 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  the securitization agreement expires in february and may be extended on an annual basis 
for each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit  we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables  which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
we pay facility fees of per annum of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to of outstanding amounts 
the investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to the company s assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
as of august   we have sold million of eligible accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately million 
in connection with the securitization program  we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately million during the fiscal year ended august  on june   we negotiated a two year  thousand credit facility for a ukrainian subsidiary with a ukrainian bank 
under the terms of the facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on libor plus a spread of 
the credit facility expires on june  and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
as of august   there were thousand of borrowings outstanding under this facility 
at august   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization program 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
we currently believe that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment  and expansion in china  eastern europe and india 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements and future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements as of august  are summarized 
table of contents below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable

the ultimate correctness of those forward looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events  and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements 
undue reliance should not be placed on those forward looking statements 
the following important factors  among others  as well as those factors set forth in our other sec filings from time to time  could affect future results and events  causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions  the level and timing of customer orders  the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs  the composition of the costs of revenue between materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  price competition  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in our assembly process  the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets  fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials  and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of our overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results 

table of contents because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and customers accounted for over of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   philips and cisco accounted for approximately and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change  shortening of product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
the ems industry s revenue declined in mid as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may adversely affect our business 
in the current economic climate  consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines 
excess manufacturing capacity has increased  and may continue to increase  pricing and competitive pressures for the ems industry as a whole and for us in particular 
consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industries 
the significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us 
if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services  we may lose that customer s business 
such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
these conditions frequently result in short product life cycles 
our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
if technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we depend on industries that utilize electronics components  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
factors affecting the industries that utilize electronics components in general could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  which result in short product life cycles 
the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested  the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
recessionary periods in our customers markets 
if any of these factors materialize  our business would suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing services to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
a substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net revenue may significantly decline 
most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity 
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategy  and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
a business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
ems providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
the success of our customers products in the market affects our business 
cancellations  reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimate of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results 
we compete with numerous ems providers and others  including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally 
the ems business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including celestica  inc  flextronics international  hon hai precision industry co  ltd  sanmina sci corporation and solectron corporation 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  ems 
most of our competitors have international operations  significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing  r d  and marketing resources than us 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic market presence  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services  and be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to ems providers 
in addition  in recent years  original design manufacturers  or odms  companies that provide design and manufacturing services to oems  have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to oems in several markets  such as notebook and desktop computers  personal computer motherboards  and consumer electronic products 
competition from odms may increase if our business in these markets grows or if odms expand further into or beyond these markets 
see business competition 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the ems industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous us and foreign ems providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  systems  r d  sales and marketing resources than we do 
consolidation in the ems industry results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
as a result  competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
in addition  companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their 
table of contents current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  profit margin compression  or loss of market share 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
we derived of revenues from international operations in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year we expect our revenues from international operations to continue to increase 
we currently operate outside the united states in vienna  austria  bruges and hasselt  belgium  belo horizonte  manaus and sao paulo  brazil  huangpu  panyu  shanghai and shenzhen  china  coventry  england  brest and meung sur loire  france  szombathely and tiszaujvaros  hungary  pimpri  india  dublin  ireland  bergamo and marcianise  italy  gotemba  japan  penang  malaysia  chihuahua  guadalajara and reynosa  mexico  amsterdam  the netherlands  kwidzyn  poland  ayr and livingston  scotland  singapore city  singapore  and uzhgorod  ukraine 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas  governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses  and inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations  and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our profitability could decline 
we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

table of contents we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions  potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  possible adverse tax and accounting effects  and the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations  and the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur 
we have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from oems 
in these acquisitions  the divesting oem will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror 
therefore  the competition for these acquisitions is intense 
in addition  certain oems may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other oems 
if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities  our growth could be adversely impacted 
arrangements entered into with divesting oems typically involve many risks  including the following the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly 
we  rather than the divesting oem  may bear the risk of excess capacity 
we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies 
we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions 
if demand for the oem s products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems 
as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements  and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks  including our ability to meet volume  product quality  timeliness and pricing requirements  and our ability to achieve the oems expected cost reduction 
in addition  when acquiring manufacturing operations  we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules 
accordingly  in these circumstances  we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues 
we may also 
table of contents not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements 
as a result of these and other risks  these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable 
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 
over the past few years  we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future 
these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities  largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand 
this alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies 
the process of restructuring entails  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
we continue to evaluate our operations and may need to undertake additional restructuring initiatives in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits 
substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components procurement 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel  maintain technological leadership  develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology  industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment  which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
in facilities that we establish or acquire  we may not be able to maintain our engineering  
table of contents technological and manufacturing process expertise 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing expertise  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects  or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims 
we manufacture and design products to our customers specifications  and  in some cases  our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
for example  medical devices that we manufacture or design  as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them  are regulated by the food and drug administration and non us counterparts of this agency 
similarly  items we manufacture for customers in the defense and aerospace industries  as well as the processes we use to produce them  are regulated by the department of defense and the federal aviation authority 
in addition  our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex 
as a result  products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects  and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
defects in the products we manufacture or design  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects or deficiencies are significant  our business reputation may also be damaged 
the failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and  in some cases  require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product 
the magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical  automotive  and aerospace and defense manufacturing services  as defects in medical devices  automotive components  and aerospace and defense systems could kill or seriously harm users of these products and others 
even if our customers are responsible for the defects  they may not  or may not have resources to  assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects 
our increasing design services offerings may result in additional exposure to product liability  intellectual property infringement and other claims we have increased our efforts to offer certain design services  primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers  and we now offer design services related to collaborative design manufacturing and turnkey solutions 
providing such services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services 
with the growth of our design services business  we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design  as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights 
such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and  regardless of their merits  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve 
we also may have greater potential exposure from warranty claims  and from product recalls due to problems caused by product design 
costs associated with possible product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims  and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
when providing collaborative design manufacturing or turnkey solutions  we may not be guaranteed revenues needed to recoup or profit from the investment in the resources necessary to design and develop products 
particularly  no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all  or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products 
furthermore  contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases  or may provide for penalties or cancellation of orders if we are late in delivering designs or products 
we may even have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards and to obtain any necessary certifications 
failure to timely obtain the necessary 
table of contents approvals or certifications could prevent us from selling these products  which in turn could harm our sales  profitability and reputation 
the success of our turnkey activity depends in part on our ability to obtain  protect  and leverage intellectual property rights to our designs 
we strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights to our turnkey solutions designs 
we believe that having a significant level of protected proprietary technology gives us a competitive advantage in marketing our services 
however  we cannot be certain that the measures that we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology 
if we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our designs  this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology  which would harm our business 
intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business 
our turnkey solutions products may compete against the products of original design manufacturers and those of original equipment manufacturers  many of whom may own the intellectual property rights underlying those products 
as a result  we could become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
additionally  customers for our turnkey solutions services typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement 
if any claims are brought against us or against our customers for such infringement  whether or not these claims have merit  we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims 
in the event of such an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non infringing alternatives or obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if our turnkey solutions products are subject to design defects  our business may be damaged and we may incur significant fees 
in our contracts with turnkey solutions customers  we generally provide them with a warranty against defects in our designs 
if a turnkey solutions product or component that we design is found to be defective in its design  this may lead to increased warranty claims 
although we have product liability insurance coverage  it may not be available on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our officers  managers and skilled personnel 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers 
generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements  and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees 
we could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers 
in order to manage our growth  we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so  our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed 
in addition  in connection with expanding our turnkey solutions activities  we must attract and retain experienced design engineers 
competition for highly skilled employees is substantial 
our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our turnkey solutions activities  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs 
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in most of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location 
we are in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining plants  which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system  and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
certain of our existing stockholders have significant control 
as of august   our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean  our chairman of the board  beneficially owned 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
our tax position  however  is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted  or if they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
our credit rating is subject to change 
our credit is rated by credit rating agencies 
for example  our senior notes were rated baa by moody s investor service  which is considered investment grade debt and bb by standard and poor s rating service  which is considered one level below investment grade debt 
if in the future our credit rating is downgraded so that neither credit rating agency rates our senior notes as investment grade debt  such a downgrade may increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving credit facilities  may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  may negatively impact the price of our common stock and may have other negative implications on our business  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the us dollar will affect our cost of sales  operating margins and revenues 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations 
we use financial instruments  primarily forward purchase contracts  to hedge us dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations 
if these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we could incur a significant amount of debt in the future 
we have the ability to borrow approximately million under our amended revolver 
in addition  we could incur additional indebtedness in the future in the form of bank loans  notes or convertible securities 
an increase in the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations 
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies 
customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history 
as a result  there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers 
in addition  due to the current economic environment  additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or we previously experienced 
this tightening of financing for start up customers  together with many start up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk  especially in accounts receivable and inventories 
although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers  including start up customers  based on the information available  these allowances may not be adequate 
this risk exists for any new emerging company customers in the future 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in the ems  aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some shareholders might consider such a development to be favorable 
our shareholder rights plan  provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and the delaware corporation laws may delay  inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of us through a tender offer  business combination  proxy contest or some other method 
these provisions include a poison pill shareholder rights plan  a statutory restriction on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent  and a statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders 
generally  we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  the loss of which could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  we do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of august  and future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and 
table of contents report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
while we intend to conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent auditors interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or issue a qualified report 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations and could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
there has been an ongoing public debate as to whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
the financial accounting standards board recently published proposed amendments to financial accounting standards that would require that awards under such plans be treated as compensation expense using the fair value method 
if we are required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we would incur significant compensation charges 
although we are currently not required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value of our common stock and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  if future laws and regulations require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method our results of operations could be adversely affected
