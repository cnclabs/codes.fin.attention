item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is one of the largest independent bulk shipping companies in the world 
the company s operating fleet consists of vessels aggregating million deadweight tons  including eight vessels that are owned by joint ventures in which the company has an average interest of  and six vessels that have been chartered in under operating leases 
operations the company s revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products from which the company earns a substantial majority of its revenue are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and level of opec s exports 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
the company s revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  the company manages its vessels based on tce revenues 
management makes economic decisions based on anticipated tce rates and evaluates financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
set forth in the tables below are daily tce rates that prevailed in markets in which the company s vessels operated for the periods indicated 
in each case  the rates may differ from the actual tce rates achieved by the company in the period indicated because of the timing and length of voyages and the portion of revenue generated from long term charters 
it is important to note that the spot market is quoted in worldscale rates 
the conversion of worldscale rates to the following tce rates requires the company to make certain assumptions as to brokerage commissions  port time  port costs  speed and fuel consumption  all of which will vary in actual usage 
foreign flag vlcc segment spot market tce rates vlccs in the arabian gulf q q q q average        high        low        during  rates for vlccs trading out of the arabian gulf averaged  per day  higher than the average for and higher than the average for although the development of vlcc rates over was positive  the market was extremely volatile during the year  with a number of extraordinary factors influencing the market 
freight rates  which rose rapidly in the final quarter of  continued their ascent in the first quarter of  reaching a first quarter high of  per day 
a general strike disrupted crude oil production in venezuela  increasing us dependence on longer haul imports from such areas as the middle east 
in addition a significant number of japanese nuclear power plants remained shutdown during as they underwent operational safety checks  increasing japanese dependence on oil for power generation 
as refiners sought to secure crude supplies ahead of an impending war in iraq  reported vlcc fixtures from the arabian gulf to the us increased by in the first quarter of compared with the first quarter of similarly  vlcc fixtures from the arabian gulf to japan were higher for the same period 
vlcc rates declined during the second and third quarters of from first quarter levels because the rapid conclusion of the war in iraq eased concerns over the security of oil supplies from the middle east  and venezuelan and nigerian oil exports were restored following disruptions caused by civil unrest 
in addition  the outbreak of sars dampened chinese oil demand during the second quarter of and japanese oil usage in the third quarter declined slightly relative to the same period in  reflecting the gradual return to operation of some nuclear power plants previously idled 
as a result  key load areas experienced a buildup of available vlcc tonnage and weaker earnings in the suezmax sector increased the competitive pressure for vlccs  contributing to lower rates  which averaged  per day during the second quarter of before falling to  per day in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter  vlcc rates rebounded to average  per day  as opec far exceeded its production quotas  taking advantage of high crude prices 
opec s quota cut effective november was intended to accommodate the restoration of iraqi production and prevent inventory buildups in consuming regions 
this quota cut was largely ignored as demand exceeded expectations due in large part to exceptionally strong chinese demand 
this coincided with a scarcity of modern tonnage in the arabian gulf 
as a result  vlcc rates surged to a fourth quarter high of  per day 
at the same time  the global economic recovery continued to gather pace  coinciding with the onset of the winter heating season 
it is estimated that global oil demand during the fourth quarter of was million barrels per day b d  an increase of relative to the previous quarter and higher than the comparable quarter in china s fourth quarter oil demand showed the strongest growth  rising over the corresponding quarter in foreign flag aframax segment spot market tce rates aframaxes in the caribbean q q q q average        high        low        during  rates for aframaxes operating in the caribbean trades averaged  per day  higher than the average for and higher than the average for aframax freight rates have been supported by the general increase in worldwide economic activity as well as rapid growth in crude oil exports from the former soviet union fsu 
total seaborne oil exports from baltic and black sea ports have increased by in in addition  transit delays in the bosporus tightened availability of aframaxes with a further positive effect on rates 
the aframax fleet carries a significant share of fsu exports from the baltic sea and the black sea 
the share of reported spot crude oil liftings carried on aframaxes from the baltic sea rose to in from in  while the aframax share of black sea exports increased to in from in in the caribbean market  the negative impact of oil export disruptions in venezuela during the first quarter of was partly offset by the positive impact of increased long haul crude oil imports to the us  which increased aframax employment for lightering operations in the us gulf 
the caribbean market also benefited from vessels repositioning to stronger markets in the north sea and the mediterranean 
mexico s subsequent increase in exports and the resumption of venezuelan exports late in the first quarter helped boost aframax rates to a first quarter high of  per day 
during the second quarter of  the gradual restoration of venezuelan exports coincided with the disappearance of iraqi crude oil shipments from ceyhan in the mediterranean and the steady decline in indonesian production due to that country s aging oil fields  as well as a sizable number of aframax newbuilding deliveries 
planned and unplanned maintenance in the black sea port of novorossiysk and the north sea during the early part of the summer further contributed to reduced demand for aframax vessels 
these factors caused aframax rates to decline to average  per day in the second quarter before falling further to  per day by the third quarter 
by the fourth quarter  aframax rates recovered to average  per day  with the onset of the winter heating season in the northern hemisphere boosting oil demand 
rates soared as high as  per day as weather related loading delays in the black sea and congestion in the bosporus tightened availability of aframaxes

however  net imports of fuel oil were so strong that by mid september  storage tanks were full  and china  as the region s largest buyer  disappeared from the market 
as a result  the market weakened during the fourth quarter of rates for bostonmax product carriers operating in the caribbean trades averaged  per day in  higher than the average for  but lower than the average for us imports of refined oil products were higher in  boosted by a series of unplanned outages at several domestic refineries

imports of transportation related products grew the most in volume terms  with gasoline imports up by in  and jet fuel imports up by 
imports of residual fuel oil increased by in  a rise stimulated by high natural gas prices and much colder winter weather than the previous year 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item revenue recognition the company generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters 
within the shipping industry  there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and completed voyage 
the recognition of voyage revenues and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues and expenses and the method currently being used by osg 
under each method  voyages may be calculated on either a load to load or discharge to discharge basis 
prior to  osg accounted for voyage revenues and expenses using the completed voyage method  with voyages calculated on a load to load basis 
accordingly  osg did not recognize the revenues and expenses of voyages until vessels had completed their trips to the next load port  and the company s revenues fluctuated from period to period because of the timing of voyage completions 
the change in method to recognize voyage revenues and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage  with voyages calculated on a discharge to discharge basis  eliminated these fluctuations because specific voyage results are allocated on a pro rata basis to the periods over which they are performed 
in applying its revenue recognition method  management believes that the discharge to discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load to load basis 
since  at the time of discharge  management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port  the discharge to discharge calculation of voyage revenues and expenses can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  osg does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the company and the customer  even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of the company s vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of years from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard 
in the shipping industry  use of a year life has become the standard 
the actual life of a vessel may be different 
the company has evaluated the impact of the revisions to marpol regulation g that become effective april  and the new eu regulations that went into force on october  on the economic lives assigned to the tankers in the company s foreign flag fleet 
because the osg foreign flag tanker fleet comprises mainly modern  double hull vessels  the revised regulations only affect two wholly owned vessels and four vessels currently held in joint ventures 
current regulations will not require any of these single hull or double sided foreign flag tankers  except the front tobago  to be removed from service prior to attaining years of age  although the trading of such vessels after could be affected 
the revised imo regulation g allows the flag state to permit the continued operation of our single hull and double sided tankers beyond because such regulations do not explicitly permit single hull and double sided tankers to continue trading beyond  their operation beyond is not assured 
two single hull vlccs will be banned from eu ports beginning in at the ages of for one vlcc which is owned by osg and years for one vlcc which is wholly owned by osg  respectively 
two double sided vlccs both owned by osg will be banned from eu ports in at the age of years 
the company s single hull suezmax tanker will be banned from eu ports in at the age of years 
a owned double sided aframax tanker will be banned from eu ports in at the age of years 
osg considered the need to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of its single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers because of the eu regulations and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by imo in december these new regulations will not prevent any of these vessels  with the exception of the front tobago  in which the company has a interest  from trading prior to reaching years of age 
the economic life of the front tobago has been reduced to accordingly  it was not deemed necessary at this time to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of any of our other single hull or double sided foreign flag tankers 
if the economic lives assigned to the tankers prove to be too long because of new regulations or other future events  higher depreciation expense and impairment losses could result in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels 
the carrying values of the company s vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
the company records impairment losses only when events occur that cause the company to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the company are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular vessel may not be fully recoverable 
in such instances  an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
we performed an impairment test for our single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers  including vessels held in joint ventures  in december  because of the new eu regulations that became effective in october and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by the imo in december for purposes of this analysis  we assumed that the single hull tankers would stop trading in and the double sided tankers would continue trading until age  in accordance with the revised and accelerated phase out schedule adopted by the imo 
we also assumed that these vessels would achieve lower tce rates than comparable double hull tankers over their remaining useful lives 
because voyage charter rates are volatile and vessel values vary over time  a probability weighted approach based on historically observed tce rates was used to estimate future cash flows 
in all cases  the carrying values of the company s single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers as of december  were less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for the respective vessels 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recorded 
we performed an impairment test for our vessels in december because of a decrease in the sales price of second hand vessels  as reported in trade publications  and the downward trend in spot rates that had persisted during and the first nine months of a probability weighted approach based on historically observed tce rates was used to estimate future cash flows 
in all cases  the carrying values of the company s vessels were less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for the respective vessels 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recorded 
market value of marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  the company s holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  therefore  are carried on the balance sheet at fair value as determined by using period end sales prices on us or foreign stock exchanges with changes in carrying value being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
accordingly  these changes in value are not reflected in the company s statements of operations 
if  however  pursuant to the provisions of fas and staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company determines that a material decline in the fair value below the company s cost basis is other than temporary  the company records a noncash impairment loss as a charge in the statement of operations in the period in which that determination is made 
as a matter of policy  the company evaluates all material declines in fair value for impairment whenever the fair value of a stock has been below its cost basis for six consecutive months 
in the period in which a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of that security is written down to its fair value at the end of such period  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
based on a number of factors  including the magnitude of the drop in market values below the company s cost bases and the length of time that the declines had been sustained  management concluded that the declines in fair value of securities with aggregate cost bases of  in and  in were other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded pre tax impairment losses of  in and  in related to such securities 
these impairment losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the capital construction fund held a diversified portfolio of marketable equity securities with an aggregate cost basis of  and an aggregate fair value of  the gross unrealized losses on equity securities held in the capital construction fund as of december  were  see note f to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item for additional information on pre tax unrealized losses as of december  drydocking within the shipping industry  there are three methods that are used to account for drydockings capitalize drydocking costs as incurred deferral method and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking  accrue the estimated cost of the next scheduled drydocking over the period preceding such drydocking  and expense drydocking costs as incurred 
since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or longer  management believes that the deferral method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense as incurred method 
the company further believes that the deferral method is preferable to the accrual method because estimates of drydocking costs can differ greatly from actual costs and  in fact  anticipated drydockings may not be performed if management decides to dispose of the vessels before their scheduled drydock dates 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is based on the assumption that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to permit the company to take deductions and use tax credit carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets are net of a valuation allowance 
during  the company recorded a valuation allowance of  related to capital losses arising from the write down of certain marketable securities 
the valuation allowance was established because the company believed that a portion of the capital losses might expire unused because the generation of future taxable capital gains was not certain 
during  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  to  based primarily on increases in the fair value of securities previously written down 
if assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  which will result in additional income tax expense in the company s statement of operations 
each quarter  management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need to change the valuation allowance 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company has recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants 
these valuations are based on key estimates and assumptions related to the discount rates used and the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets 
osg is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments 
a higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is management s best estimate of expected returns 
a decrease in the expected rate of return will increase future net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease future benefit costs 
with respect to the company s domestic plans  as of december   management reduced the discount rate to from and maintained unchanged the expected rate of return on plan assets at 
changes in pension and other postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes in these rates 
special purpose entity spe in  the company facilitated the creation of an spe that purchased from and bareboat chartered back to the company five us flag crude tankers that the company in turn bareboat chartered to alaska tanker company for the transportation of alaskan crude oil for bp 
the purchase price of million was financed by a term loan from a commercial lender and a substantive equity capital investment by the owner of the spe 
the company did not guarantee the vessels residual values or guarantee the spe s debt 
atc time chartered the vessels to bp under a hell or highwater lease through the dates on which they must be removed from service in accordance with opa the portion of the charter hire payments from bp to atc representing bareboat charter hire to the company is sufficient to fully amortize the debt of the spe 
such payments have been assigned to the spe

under the provisions of fin  the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the spe 
for additional information  see note b to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item income from vessel operations during  tce revenues increased by  or  to  from  in  principally resulting from an increase in average daily tce rates for vessels operating in the spot market

the reduction in percentage contribution from long term charters during compared with was principally attributable to significant increases in average tce rates in for vessels operating in the spot market and the expiry  in early  of a long term charter on a vlcc 
the reliance on the spot market contributes to fluctuations in the company s revenue  cash flow  and net income loss  but affords the company greater opportunity to increase income from vessel operations when rates rise 
on the other hand  time and bareboat charters provide the company with a predictable level of revenues

all but one of the vessels in the vlcc segment participate in the tankers pool as of december  the increase in revenue days resulted principally from the delivery of two newbuilding vlccs one in april and another in mid february and the april purchase of a built double hull vlcc  meridian lion  previously held by a owned joint venture see note e to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 
the redemption of the other partner s joint venture interest in the equatorial lion and meridian lion as described in note e to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item and the simultaneous acquisition of the meridian lion from the other partner resulted in the inclusion of both vessels in the vlcc segment from the mid april effective date of the transaction 
the equatorial lion  which had  prior to the completion of this transaction  been time chartered in from the joint venture is now owned by a subsidiary of the company

the us flag dry bulk carriers no longer meet the materiality threshold established by fas for disclosure as a reportable segment 
this was due to the reduction in shipping revenues attributable to the sale of two of that segment s vessels during and tce revenues increased by  or  to  in from  in principally because of an increase of  per day in the average daily tce rate earned 
vessel expenses decreased by  to  in from  in because of the sale of one of the us flag dry bulk carriers in june depreciation and amortization increased by  to  in from  in because of increased amortization of drydock costs on the two remaining us flag dry bulk carriers 
the two foreign flag dry bulk carriers commenced three year time charters in early  at which time they were withdrawn from the pool of capesize vessels in which they had participated since tce revenues decreased by  or  to  in from  in principally because of a reduction of days  in the company s participation in the charter in of vessels that were commercially managed by a pool of capesize dry bulk carriers and the impact of the sale of two us flag dry bulk carriers one in june and one in june 
these decreases were offset by an increase of per day in the average daily tce rate earned 
vessel expenses decreased by  to  in from  in because of the sale of the two us flag dry bulk carriers 
the decrease in time and bareboat charter hire expenses of  in compared with was attributable to the reduced participation in the charter in of vessels that were commercially managed by the pool of capesize bulk carriers 
the average daily rates paid during and with respect to these chartered in vessels were higher than the tce rates earned by such vessels 
accordingly  the reduced participation in the charter in of vessels positively affected consolidated income from vessel operations by  in compared with since december  the us flag pure car carrier has received payments of  per year under the us maritime security program  which continues through late  subject to annual congressional appropriations
