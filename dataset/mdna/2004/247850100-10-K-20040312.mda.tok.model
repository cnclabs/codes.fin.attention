item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages the company s timberlands  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s three real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  planning  accounting  information systems  human resources  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands in order to increase productivity and maximize the long term value of these timber assets 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market 
the company implemented a timberland acquisition program in late  and this ongoing program has enabled the company to increase harvest levels over time  while expanding its timber inventory 
thus far  the company has focused its acquisition program on timberland in its current operating area 
the company also initiated a program in to identify for possible sale non strategic timberland and higher and better use lands 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  boards  timbers  decking  and secondary manufacturing products  such as finger jointed studs 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the south and midwest and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to add value to former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a  acre upscale planned community 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 
the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began  in the plant is designed to have an annual capacity of million square feet mmsf on a inch basis  making it one of the largest plants of its type in the world 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  flooring  and moulding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  held together by an adhesive bond 

table of contents executive overview with the exception of its diversification in real estate development  deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw material  and weather conditions 
despite a record level for us housing starts and an increase in us lumber consumption in  the domestic industry continued to suffer from an oversupply of softwood lumber due to overproduction in north america and increased imports  primarily from canada 
these factors resulted in reduced lumber prices for the first six months of the year and were an extension of a weakened lumber market that had already seen a three year low cycle 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no control over pricing levels for its wood products 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions and interest rates  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
a strong housing market  helped by low interest rates and an improving economy  benefited the company s residential and commercial real estate sales activity during four significant accomplishments for the year of were the woodlands segment met planned timber harvest levels at budgeted sales prices  despite pressure from a thin margined  commodity based lumber market  deltic achieved substantial improvements in productivity at one of its sawmills  while installing critical equipment to enhance manufacturing capacity at the other  the company s real estate operations had outstanding performance in both residential and commercial sales activity  and del tin fiber improved its operations and reduced its operating losses by approximately one half compared to woodlands segment operating results for were enhanced by an increase in sales of timberland for higher and better use and non strategic timberland at higher average sales prices than realized in during the current year  the company sold  acres of timberland at an average price of  per acre  which included a choice acre tract from deltic s  acre timberland holdings just west of the chenal valley real estate development 
while the company expects timberland sales activity in will approximate the acreage sold in  it expects the mix of properties sold to reduce average sales prices from the level as plans reflect more of the acreage sold to be non strategic timberland 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  and acreage otherwise not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
the company has implemented a plan to sell some such acreage in the southwest portion of arkansas  where outlets for timber consist primarily of paper manufacturers desiring pulpwood for raw material rather than sawmills utilizing pine sawtimber logs 
for  the pine sawtimber harvest level was decreased percent  from  tons to  tons  due to the completion  in  of the company s three year harvest plan for well stocked timberland acreage acquired in the harvest level represents a harvest that allows the company to manage its timber on a sustainable yield basis 
despite downward pressure from the depressed lumber market in the first half of  deltic was able to harvest its planned level of pine sawtimber while maintaining relatively stable sales prices 
the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be largely dependent upon the market for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
for the mills segment  the status of the lumber market and the resulting impact on the company s commodity softwood lumber products continues to significantly impact operating strategies and financial results 
the implementation of duties on canadian lumber imports in may exacerbated the existing oversupply of lumber in the us  as a number of canadian producers responded by increasing production in efforts to reduce their per unit manufacturing costs 
this situation persisted for the entire first half of until the impact of significant fires on the west coast of the us and in the province of british columbia  work stoppages in british columbia  and weakening of the us dollar and resulting strengthening of the canadian dollar began to reduce production and import levels 
these events led to an improvement in prices for lumber products for the last half of a record breaking year in for both single family home construction and sales of existing single family homes  which typically results in repair and remodeling expenditures  raised lumber consumption 
also aiding demand and price levels for southern pine lumber was the impact of lumber 
table of contents treaters ramping up production in the last half of before the ban on treatment of residential lumber products with the traditional preservative  chromated copper arsentate  took effect 
as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future  however resolution of the trade dispute with canada regarding imports of softwood lumber could help to stabilize  or possibly improve  the markets for the company s lumber products 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth after inflation for their products  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
these production efficiency improvements are largely dependent upon increases in hourly production rates and mill uptime percentage 
for  the average sawmill production per hour at the company s two mills increased eight percent  while planermill production improved ten percent 
in an additional effort to further improve productivity and efficiencies at its ola mill  the company eliminated a shift effective september  resulting decreased production from this mill will allow deltic to supply a significant portion of total log supply requirements from strategically located company fee timberlands 
in the future  the company anticipates that a more significant percentage of logs supplied to both of its mills will come from such fee lands 
real estate sales activity levels for the company s real estate developments are affected by economic conditions that influence the level of housing starts in the central arkansas region  including general economic conditions and interest rates 
low mortgage interest rates in aided demand for residential lots in chenal valley  as evidenced by the company s lots sold in  which reduced available uncommitted inventory in this development to only lots at the end of weather related delays prevented the company from offering for sale the lots planned for completion in chenal valley during the fourth quarter of however  construction of these plus an additional lots  for a total of lots in three neighborhoods  was completed in january and offered for sale on january  the company plans to develop another lots later in in deltic s other two developments  red oak ridge and chenal downs  developed lots were uncommitted as of year end future annual lot development levels will be dependent upon the demand for the company s residential lots  which is expected to remain strong as long as interest rates remain at or near current levels 
the  average sales price for residential lots sold in increased percent when compared to average price for a reporting period is largely dependent on the mix of lots sold in that period 
deltic s lot development plans provide for a mix of lot offerings that represent all real estate market segments for a planned community 
of the residential lots sold in  were located in the first two neighborhoods adjoining chenal country club s new hole golf course designed by robert trent jones  jr 
compared to in the prior year 
such golf course lots represent the highest market segment in the development 
the mix of lot offerings for any given year will be driven by remaining lot availability and expected demand 
the increase in commercial real estate sales activity during was a significant benefit to the year s results 
in  commercial sales totaled approximately acres for million 
with the number of residents in chenal valley and other west little rock areas growing steadily and the momentum created from previous sales of commercial acreage  such as the acre site sold to wal mart in the first quarter of  interest in remaining commercial offerings is increasing 
as of december   about acres  or percent  of the acres of property currently zoned as commercial in chenal valley is available for sale in future periods 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal downs development 
red oak ridge is planned to include approximately acres of commercial property 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 
operating results for del tin fiber are affected primarily by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
for much of  the us mdf market was oversupplied  and china s mdf industry is growing rapidly 
in addition  segments of the us furniture manufacturing industry have relocated to the far east  furniture manufacturers are a primary purchaser of mdf 
however  with continued strong levels of housing starts and repair and remodeling activity in the us  industry analysts project mdf consumption to grow five to six percent in and possibly return to double digit growth rates after the level of imports has continued to grow steadily  but the weakening us dollar could slow further increase early in in  
table of contents the mdf market was affected by the level of inventories accumulated by producers during  lower consumption by furniture manufacturers as this industry suffered attrition  and usage patterns in industrial markets switching away from industrial end use of thicker panels  as in furniture  to construction related markets such as laminate flooring and mouldings 
most producers in the industry need further price increases  in addition to manufacturing cost reductions  to become profitable in the short term 
the predicted increases in consumption should strengthen the market unless import levels surge 
operationally  del tin fiber made significant advances during the last half of the plant s management focused on raising the plant s uptime percentage to be in line with the industry average and reduced the plant s manning level to improve its cost structure 
in addition  the facility greatly improved the percentage of its production of premium grade product which increased sales realizations 
change in the product mix at the plant also positively impacted average sales prices  as the percentage of thin board was increased due to improvements in the plant s operating performance 
future efforts are being concentrated on improving productivity levels and plant efficiencies and to making additional reductions in the plant s manufacturing cost per msf as hourly production rates increase and improvements to the raw material mix for the operations are implemented 
significant events since production began at del tin fiber in  both operating and financial performance have been below the expectations established at the time that the decision to construct the plant was made 
as a result  on april   deltic announced that banc one capital markets  inc had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the company s investment in del tin fiber 
subsequently  deltic s management and board of directors completed its review of these strategic alternatives and determined that the mdf business did not represent a growth area for the company 
consequently  an announcement was made that the company intended to exit the mdf business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  the company s evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture was based primarily upon the estimated cash flows from a sale of the company s interest during and resulted in a determination that the company investment was impaired as of december  the investment was written off  to zero  and the write off amounted to million before income taxes 
due to the company s commitment to fund its share of any of the facility s operating working capital needs until the facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or deltic s ownership was sold  the company recognized equity in del tin fiber equal to the extent of these advances during for the year  such advances approximated the company s equity share of losses for the plant  accordingly  the investment in del tin fiber at december   was zero 
the company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with del tin s management and the joint venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant 
as a result of these improvements  on december   deltic s board of directors revised its intent regarding the company s investment in del tin fiber and ceased efforts to sell the company s interest in the joint venture  while continuing to focus on improving operating and financial results of the plant 
due to this decision  the evaluation of fair value for the investment was based primarily upon the future net cash flows from del tin fiber s operations over the remaining life of the plant 
the estimated fair value from this evaluation indicated that no impairment existed as of december  for future years  the company will record its equity share of the operating results of the joint venture 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   deltic redeemed the  outstanding shares of its percent redeemable preferred stock 
this was primarily effected by utilizing proceeds from the company s issuance of million of privately placed  long term senior notes on december  these notes bear interest at a fixed stated rate of percent 
this redemption has produced an after tax savings and reduced net cash outflows for the company when comparing the non deductible carrying cost of the preferred stock 

table of contents in august  the company s board of directors approved the disposal of deltic s agriculture segment assets  subject to using the sales proceeds to purchase additional southern pine timberland  via tax deferred exchanges 
as a result  activities of this segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
deltic engaged an agricultural land consulting and brokerage firm to act as advisors in evaluating and marketing about  acres approximately  acres net to deltic of farmland located in northeast louisiana 
the sale of all farmland and related operational assets  as well as the acquisition of replacement property in the form of timberland  was successfully concluded during for additional information about the company s discontinued agriculture operations  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements

interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s funds held by trustee  long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were million  million  million  and 
million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million and contractual guarantees of debt of 
million  while the fair value of the company s funds held by trustee and letters of credit would be unchanged 
initial fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately 
million  holding other variables constant

critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified five of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
these costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s three development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent  professional engineering consultants 
appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of its undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated 
table of contents balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture  and the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value at december  for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners and the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
more specifically  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company s professional foresters estimate its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized 
fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been million more in  million less in  and million less in million  
million  million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of fee timber harvested recognized is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are 
table of contents expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management has also evaluated any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate an impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations

stock based compensation at december   deltic had two stock based compensation plans for which the company applies the recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
stock based employee compensation expense is accrued for the intrinsic value  if any  of stock options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight line method 
options granted by the company have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as of november  the company eliminated certain option exercise procedures  resulting in a change to fixed plan accounting treatment for all options 
prior to that date  the company was required to apply variable plan accounting standards which required adjustment of the cost of options granted for changes in the market value per share of the company s common stock 
for additional information  see note incentive plans 
the effect on net income loss and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for the years ended december consisted of the following thousands of dollars  except per share amounts net income loss  as reported plus total stock based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value method for awards  net of related tax effects  included in the determination of net income less pro forma total stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss 
table of contents thousands of dollars  except per share amounts basic earnings per share as reported pro forma dilutive earnings per share as reported pro forma for the pro forma net income calculation in the preceding table  the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in   and  respectively dividend yields of percent  percent  and percent  expected volatility of percent  percent  and percent  risk free interest rates of percent  percent  and percent  and expected lives of five years 
using these assumptions  the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted in   and was   and  respectively 
the key management decision factors for stock based compensation are the decision to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value recognition and measurement principles of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stocked based compensation transition and disclosure  and the determination of the exercise price for options granted 
currently  a company s management can elect to adopt sfas or continue to use apb for recognizing stock option expense in its financial statements 
if continued use of apb is elected  the income statement will generally reflect a lesser amount for stock based compensation expense  and the potential impact of adopting sfas and sfas will only be disclosed on a pro forma basis in the financial statement footnotes 
under the company s stock incentive plan  option exercise price for options granted is equal to the fair market per share stock price on the date of the grant  which should result in no stock based compensation expense for future options granted under the company s stock incentive plan 
however  options granted in february were subject to shareholder approval at the company s annual stockholders meeting on april   the accounting measurement date for these options 
as a result  these options had an intrinsic value of per share due to an increase in the market price of the company s common stock between february and april  and the resulting stock based compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting periods of these options
