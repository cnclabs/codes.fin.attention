in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined under the caption important 
table of contents factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price set forth at the end of this item and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview we focus on the development of monoclonal antibody based therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer and immunologic diseases 
we currently have two product candidates in phase ii clinical development  sgn and sgn  and one product candidate for which we recently opened a phase i clinical trial  sgn additionally  we have three product candidates in preclinical development sgn  sgn and sgn our pipeline of product candidates is based upon three technologies genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies  monoclonal antibody drug conjugates adcs and antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy adept 
these technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill target cells on their own as well as increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by enhancing their cell killing ability 
we also have active discovery programs to identify novel antigens and new monoclonal antibodies 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated loss of million 
these losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development of our monoclonal antibody based technologies  clinical trial costs  manufacturing expenses of preclinical and clinical grade materials  general and administrative costs and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
we expect that our losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our research  development  clinical trial activities and infrastructure in support of these activities 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
to date  our revenues have been derived principally from our collaboration and license agreements and from small business innovative research sbir grants 
in the future  our revenues may consist of milestone payments  technology licensing fees and sponsored research fees under existing and future collaborative arrangements  royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners  grant revenues and commercial product sales 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on entering into new collaboration and license agreements and achieving development and clinical milestones under existing collaboration and license agreements  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
revenues in thousands annual percentage change collaborations and license agreements government grants total 
table of contents total revenues for were million  a increase from  primarily due to higher collaboration and license agreement revenues 
total revenues for were million  a increase from  due to both higher collaboration and license revenues and higher sbir government grant revenues 
collaboration and license agreement revenue changes are further discussed below 
collaboration and license agreements in thousands annual percentage change funded research and material supply fees earned portion of technology access fees and milestones total funded research and material supply fees increased to million in from and increased to  in from this revenue growth came from increased fees earned as part of the research programs of our adc collaborators  genentech  celltech group and protein design labs  during and and our adept collaborator  genencor  in the earned portion of technology access fees and milestones increased to million in from and increased to  in from these revenues are primarily upfront technology access fees that are being recognized ratably over the research period of each collaboration 
we expect that future revenues will vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter based on the timing and amounts of payments under our current license and collaboration agreements and our ability to enter into additional agreements and obtain additional government grants 
research and development 
research and development in thousands annual percentage change total research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from and increased to million in from the increase in was principally due to increases in personnel expenses of approximately million  reduced collaboration expense reimbursement of approximately  increases in depreciation and occupancy costs of approximately  and increases in recruiting and relocation costs for new personnel of approximately  these expenses were offset by decreases in external clinical trial costs of approximately  personnel expenses in reflect higher increases than relative to headcount growth because of senior level personnel hired during including our chief scientific officer  chief medical officer and senior director  antibody technologies 
the increase in was principally due to increases in personnel expenses of approximately million  increases in rent  depreciation and occupancy costs related to our new headquarters and operations facility of approximately million  increases in laboratory materials and supplies of approximately  and increases in external clinical trial costs of approximately  these expenses were offset by decreases in costs of manufacturing clinical grade materials of approximately  and increased collaboration expense reimbursement of approximately  the number of research and development personnel increased to at december  from at december  and from at december  
table of contents our research and development expenses can be divided into research  development and contract manufacturing and clinical programs 
we estimate the costs associated with these programs as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new antigen targets and monoclonal antibodies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials 
clinical expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external clinical trials costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
costs associated with our clinical activities decreased in from due to the completion of our patient enrollments to our sgn phase i trials and our sgn non small cell lung phase ii trial 
because of the large number of research and development programs ongoing at any one time and our ability to utilize staffing resources across several research programs  the majority of our research and development costs are not assigned to individual programs and are instead allocated among multiple programs 
for purposes of reimbursement from our collaborators  we capture the level of effort expended on a project through our project tracking system  which is based primarily on the human resource time associated with each project  supplemented with material costs 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities  as new product candidates enter clinical trials and as we advance our product candidates already in clinical trials 
these expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  level of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
general and administrative 
general and administrative in thousands annual percentage change total general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  the increase was principally due to additional administrative personnel  benefit and severance pay costs and increased expenses for liability and directors and officers insurance 
the number of general and administrative personnel increased to at december  from at december  and from at december  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as our costs related to adding personnel in support of our operations increase 
in addition  we will incur additional professional fees in order to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of that go into effect for and 
table of contents non cash stock based compensation 
non cash stock based compensation in thousands annual percentage change total non cash stock based compensation expense decreased to million in from and decreased to million in from these decreases are attributable to the accelerated amortization of deferred stock based compensation  changes for stock option cancellations from employees who have left the company and changes in value of options subject to variable accounting 
variable accounting treatment results in charges or credits  recorded to non cash stock based compensation  depending on fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
we anticipate that non cash stock based compensation expense will continue to decrease in the future based upon scheduled amortizations in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
however  if new accounting rules become effective and require fair value accounting for stock options we expect to record additional stock based compensation charges 
investment income  net 
investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income decreased to million in from and decreased to million in from in  the decrease was primarily due to declining average interest yields 
in  the decrease was due to a combination of lower average investment balances and declining average interest yields 
we anticipate that investment income will increase during through the investment of the net proceeds of approximately million from our follow on public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in february non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend 
non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend in thousands total non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend was  in as part of our series a convertible preferred stock financing  we are recording a non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend  which represents an increase to reported net loss in arriving at net loss attributable to common stockholders  using the effective interest method through the date of earliest conversion 
we estimate that we will record additional non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend of million in the non cash accretion of the preferred stock deemed dividend will not have an effect on net loss or cash flows for the applicable reporting periods or have an impact on total stockholders equity as of the applicable reporting dates 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources at december cash  cash equivalents and investments working capital for the year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and funding from our collaboration and license agreements 
we received million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in and million of net proceeds from our private placement of series a convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants in from to  we received million from the issuance of common stock to our collaborators pursuant to our collaboration and license agreements and approximately million in fees and milestones under our collaboration and license agreements 
at december   cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments totaled million 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
we expect cash used in operating activities to increase in the future as we increase our number of employees  expand our contract manufacturing initiatives and increase the patient enrollments in our clinical trials 
however  we may experience quarterly fluctuations in cash used in operating activities based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns and cash provided from collaboration activities 
capital expenditures in both and consisted primarily of lab equipment  computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities 
capital expenditures in consisted primarily of tenant improvements  lab equipment  furniture and fixtures  all in connection with our headquarters and operation facility which we moved to in august we expect that our capital expenditures will increase based on additional improvements we are making to our existing headquarters and operations facility for lab and office expansion to accommodate future employee growth 
we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of the increased costs and expenses associated with adding personnel  clinical trials  regulatory filings  manufacturing  and research and development collaborations 
however  we may experience fluctuations in incurring these costs from quarter to quarter based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients to clinical trials and collaborative activities 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including factors such as the progress of our research and development activities  the cost of filing and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and our ability to establish collaboration and license agreements 

table of contents the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements construction contracts total some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements also provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth above could be substantially higher if we are required to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements in primarily represent contractual obligations related to manufacturing campaigns to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing for monoclonal antibody products for use in our clinical trials 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have collateralized certain obligations under the lease with approximately  of our investments and the majority of our property and equipment 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
beginning in  the lease provides for decreases in the restricted account balance on an annual basis 
in the event that we fail to meet specific thresholds of market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investment balances  we would be obligated to increase our restricted investment balance 
at december   we were in compliance with these thresholds 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures and operating requirements for at least the next months 
however  changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
subsequent events in march  we entered into agreements with construction companies for additional improvements to our headquarters and operations facility for lab and office expansion 
we have committed in the aggregate approximately million for construction related activities 
in february  we entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for manufacturing of our sgn monoclonal antibody product candidate 
this antibody is also used in our sgn antibody drug conjugate product candidate 
under the terms of the agreement  abbott has agreed to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing for clinical trials  as well as supply commercial grade material to support potential regulatory approval and commercial launch 
our total costs through of manufacturing sgn with abbott could be up to million 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  the underwriters of the public offering exercised their over allotment option in full and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock 
total gross proceeds from this offering were approximately million  with total net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting the discount paid to the underwriters and other estimated offering expenses payable by us 

table of contents in january  we agreed to expand our adc collaboration with protein design labs 
under the amended agreement  we have agreed to provide additional support to protein design labs in their development of adc product candidates 
in exchange  protein design labs has agreed to pay us increased fees  milestones and royalties on net sales of any adc products resulting from the collaboration  and has granted us a license and options for two additional licenses under their antibody humanization patents 
protein design labs has agreed to pay us to provide preclinical quantities of our proprietary drug linker 
protein design labs is responsible for all costs associated with the development  manufacturing and marketing of any adc products generated as a result of this collaboration 
under the terms of the license agreement  we are required to pay protein design labs annual maintenance fees and royalties on net sales of products using protein design labs technology 
important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference herein 
if we do not effectively address the risks we face  our business will suffer and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our product candidates are at an early stage of development and  if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them  we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations 
all of our product candidates are in early stages of development 
significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
currently  sgn and sgn are in clinical trials and we plan begin treating patients in our open phase i trial of sgn in early we are also conducting preclinical development of sgn  sgn and sgn we expect that much of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to these clinical and preclinical product candidates 
we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on first receiving fda approval 
thereafter  the commercial success of these product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by physicians  patients  third party payors and other key decision makers as therapeutic and cost effective alternatives to currently available products 
if we fail to gain approval from the fda or to produce a commercially successful product  we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern 
we will continue to need significant amounts of additional capital that may not be available to us 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial activities 
we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other means  including collaborations and license agreements 
however  changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the size  complexity and timing of our clinical programs  
table of contents our receipt of milestone based payments or other revenue from our collaborations or license arrangements  the ability to manufacture sufficient drug supply to complete clinical trials  progress with clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs associated with acquisitions or licenses of additional products  including licenses we may need to commercialize our products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and product commercialization activities 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
clinical trials for our product candidates are expensive  time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 
before we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate that we wish to develop  we are required to complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy 
each of these trials requires the investment of substantial expense and time 
we are currently conducting phase ii clinical trials of our two most advanced product candidates  and expect to commence additional trials of these and other product candidates in the future 
there are numerous factors that could delay each of these clinical trials or prevent us from completing these trials successfully 
commercialization of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon successful completion of additional research and development and testing in both clinical trials and preclinical models 
at the present time  sgn  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in clinical development and sgn  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in preclinical development 
as a result  any delays or difficulties we encounter with these product candidates may impact our ability to generate revenue and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety or efficacy to obtain requisite regulatory approvals 
we still only have limited efficacy data from our phase i and phase ii clinical trials of sgn and sgn phase i and phase ii clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate but rather to test safety  to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the drug candidate s side effects at various doses and schedules 
furthermore  success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large scale trials will be successful nor does it predict final results 
acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
we believe that any clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of sgn or sgn  whether phase ii or phase iii  will likely involve a large number of patients to achieve statistical significance and will be expensive 
we may conduct lengthy and expensive clinical trials of sgn or sgn  only to learn that the drug candidate is not an effective treatment 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
in addition  clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause it to be redone or terminated 
in addition  failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols could result in the test or control group experiencing a disproportionate number of adverse events and could cause a clinical trial to be redone or terminated 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by the fda or another regulatory authority may also vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product involved  as well as other factors 

table of contents our clinical trials may take longer to complete than we project or they may not be completed at all 
the timing of the commencement  continuation and completion of clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes  including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  and shortages of available drug supply 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
we depend on medical institutions to conduct our clinical trials and to the extent they fail to enroll patients for our clinical trials or are delayed for a significant time in achieving full enrollment  we may be affected by increased costs  program delays or both  which may harm our business 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s guidelines and are subject to oversight by the fda and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted 
in addition  clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our product candidates produced under the fda s current good manufacturing practices  and may require large numbers of test patients 
we or the fda might delay or halt our clinical trials of a product candidate for various reasons  including deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials  the product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects  the time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected  fatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments  the product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies  quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards  or we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete the trials 
due to these and other factors  our current product candidates or any of our other future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval  which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
we currently rely on third party manufacturers and other third parties for production of our drug products and our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the development of our product candidates 
we do not currently have the ability to manufacture ourselves the drug products that we need to conduct our clinical trials 
we received clinical grade sgn from bristol myers squibb for our previous clinical trials  and have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers to supplement our supplies of sgn as necessary for future studies  including icos corporation  albany molecular research and sicor inc  now a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
for sgn  we have contracted with icos to manufacture preclinical and early stage clinical supplies and with abbott laboratories for late stage clinical and commercial supplies 
for sgn  genentech manufactured substantial quantities of clinical grade material that have been transferred to us 
in addition  we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process  including synthesis of our next generation drug linker systems  conjugation  vialing and storage of our product candidates 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce  vial and store sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
if our contract 
table of contents manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver our product candidates for clinical use on a timely basis  with sufficient quality  and at commercially reasonable prices  and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities  we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our product candidates 
in addition  we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce our product candidates 
if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these raw materials with alternative suppliers  our ability to have our product candidates manufactured and to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates would be adversely affected 
securing phase iii and commercial quantities of our product candidates from contract manufacturers will require us to commit significant capital and resources 
we may also be required to enter into long term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and or substantial termination penalties 
in addition  contract manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments  loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available product candidates 
our contract manufacturers are required to produce our clinical product candidates under fda current good manufacturing practices in order to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials 
if such standards change  the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates on the schedule we require for our clinical trials may be affected 
in addition  contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce and market our product candidates 
any difficulties or delays in our contractors manufacturing and supply of product candidates could increase our costs  cause us to lose revenue or make us postpone or cancel clinical trials 
the fda requires that we demonstrate structural and functional comparability between the same drug product manufactured by different organizations 
because we have used or intend to use multiple sources to manufacture sgn  sgn and sgn  we will need to conduct comparability studies to assess whether manufacturing changes have affected the product safety  identity  purity or potency of any commercial drug candidate compared to the drug candidate used in clinical trials 
if we are unable to demonstrate comparability  the fda could require us to conduct additional clinical trials  which would be expensive and significantly delay any commercialization 
our second generation adc technology and adept technology are still at an early stage of development and have not yet entered human clinical trials 
our second generation adc technology  utilizing proprietary stable linkers and highly potent cell killing drugs  and our adept technology are still at an early stage of development 
the adc technology is used in our sgn and sgn product candidates and is the basis of our collaborations with genentech  celltech and protein design labs 
the adept technology is used in our sgn product candidate and is the basis of our collaboration with genencor 
we and our corporate collaborators are still conducting toxicology  pharmacology  pharmacokinetics and other preclinical studies  and significant additional studies will be required before any of these adc or adept product candidates enter human clinical trials 
in addition  preclinical models to study anticancer activity of compounds are not necessarily predictive of toxicity or efficacy of these compounds in the treatment of human cancer 
any failures or setbacks in our adc or adept programs could have a detrimental impact on our internal product candidate pipeline and our ability to maintain and or enter into new corporate collaborations regarding this technology  which would negatively affect our business and financial position 
we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time  if at all 
our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our business and an investment in our common stock 
we have incurred net losses in each of our years of operation and  as of december   we had an accumulated loss of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as the result of the increased costs and expenses associated with research  development  clinical trials  manufacturing  regulatory 
table of contents approvals and commercialization of our potential products 
in addition  as a result of our private placement of series a convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants completed in from which we received million of net proceeds  we will record an additional million in non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend which will increase our reported net loss attributable to common stockholders in the first three quarters of in the near term  we expect our revenues to be derived from technology licensing fees  sponsored research fees and milestone payments under existing and future collaborative arrangements and from government grants 
in the longer term  our revenues may also include royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners and commercial product sales 
however  our revenue and profit potential is unproven and our limited operating history makes our future operating results difficult to predict 
in some circumstances we rely on collaborators to assist in the research and development activities necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are not able to locate suitable collaborators or if our collaborators do not perform as expected  we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we have established and intend to continue to establish alliances with third party collaborators to develop and market some of our current and future product candidates and to license our adc and adept technologies 
we have licensed our adc technology to genentech  celltech and protein design labs  and have licensed our adept technology to genencor international 
these collaborations provide us with cash and revenues through technology access and license fees  sponsored research fees  equity sales and potential milestone and royalty payments 
we use these funds to partially fund the development costs of our internal pipeline of product candidates 
collaborations can also create and strengthen our relationships with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and may provide synergistic benefits by combining our technologies with the technologies of our collaborators 
under certain conditions  these collaborators may terminate their agreements with us and discontinue use of our technologies 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborators may devote to products incorporating our technology 
additionally  our relationships with our collaborators divert significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team and require effective allocation of our resources to multiple internal and collaborative projects 
our collaborators may separately pursue competing products  therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborators 
even if our collaborators continue their contributions to the collaborative arrangements  they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
our collaborators may fail to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements or may be slow in performing their obligations 
if any of our collaborators terminate or breach our agreements with them  or otherwise fail to complete their obligations in a timely manner  it may have a detrimental effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive technology access and license fees  milestones and royalties  as well as possibly requiring us to devote additional efforts and incur costs associated with pursuing internal development of product candidates 
furthermore  if our collaborators do not prioritize and commit substantial resources to programs associated with our product candidates  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates  which would limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable 
in the future  we may not be able to locate third party collaborators to develop and market our product candidates and we may lack the capital and resources necessary to develop all our product candidates alone 
we depend on a small number of collaborators for most of our current revenue 
the loss of any one of these collaborators could result in a substantial decline in our revenue 
we have collaborations with a limited number of companies 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate collaborators  and we expect that most of our future revenue will continue to come from corporate collaborations until the approval and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates 
the failure of our collaborators to perform their obligations under their agreements with us  including paying license or technology fees  milestone payments or royalties  could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
in addition  a large portion of revenue received from our corporate collaborators is derived from research and material supply fees  and a decision by any of our corporate collaborators to conduct more research and development activities themselves could significantly reduce the revenue received from these collaborations 
payments under our existing and future collaboration agreements are also subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount  which could cause our revenue to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and cause a decrease in our stock price 

table of contents we rely on license agreements for certain aspects of our product candidates and technology 
failure to maintain these license agreements or to secure any required new licenses could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates and technology 
we have entered into agreements with third party commercial and academic institutions to license technology for use in our adc technology and product candidates 
currently  we have license agreements with bristol myers squibb  arizona state university  genentech  protein design labs  medarex  icos corporation  mabtech ab and the university of miami  among others 
some of these license agreements contain diligence and milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed upon diligence requirements or milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement 
many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if our licensors terminate our license agreements or if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive license agreements  we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  continued development and commercialization of our product candidates may require us to secure licenses to additional technologies 
we may not be able to secure these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs 
the inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our product candidate development 
several third parties provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  including in vitro and in vivo studies  assay and reagent development  immunohistochemistry  toxicology  pharmacokinetics and other outsourced activities 
if these service providers do not perform the services we have contracted for adequately or cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our product candidates  our development programs may be delayed 
if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
similarly  if we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to develop competing therapies 
our success depends  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges in the united states  canada  france  germany  japan  united kingdom and italy  as well as other countries 
we have filed multiple us and foreign patent applications for our technologies that are currently pending 
we also have rights to issued us patents  patent applications  and their foreign counterparts  relating to our monoclonal antibody and drug based technologies 
our rights to these patents and patent applications are derived from worldwide licenses from bristol myers squibb  arizona state university  genentech and protein design labs  among others 
in addition  we have licensed or optioned rights to pending us patent applications  patents that may issue therefrom  and any foreign counterpart patents and patent applications to third parties 
the standards that the us patent and trademark office and foreign patent offices use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change 
consequently  our pending patent applications may not be allowed and  if allowed  may not contain the type and extent of patent claims that will be adequate to conduct our business as planned 
additionally  any issued patents may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology 
similarly  the standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may evolve  particularly as new technologies develop 
as a result  the protection  if any  given by our patents if we attempt to enforce them or if they are challenged in court is uncertain 
we rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets and other proprietary information are difficult to protect 
we have taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees  consultants and certain contractors 
it is possible  however  that these persons may breach the agreements or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets or other proprietary information 

table of contents our research collaborators may publish data and information in which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be impaired 
we may incur substantial costs and lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
these proceedings are costly and time consuming 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our future growth and ability to compete would suffer 
we are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  our chief scientific officer and our chief medical officer 
additionally  we have several scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in monoclonal antibodies and related technologies 
the loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial or scientific staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
the competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense  and our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled scientific  technical and managerial employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we will be required to expand our workforce  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and sales and marketing 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
to the extent we are not able to attract and retain these individuals on favorable terms  our business may be harmed 
we face intense competition and rapid technological change  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to antibody therapy 
some of these competitors have successfully commercialized antibody products or are developing or testing product candidates that do or may in the future compete directly with our product candidates 
for example  we believe that companies including genentech  amgen  immunogen  biogen idec  medarex and wyeth are developing and or marketing products that may compete with ours 
other potential competitors include large  fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies  which have significant resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing 
also  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  development  manufacturing and marketing 
it is possible that these competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than our product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 

table of contents if our competitors develop superior products  manufacturing capability or marketing expertise  our business may fail 
our business may fail because we face intense competition from major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies engaged in the development of other products directed at cancer 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources expertise and more experience in the commercialization of product candidates 
our competitors may  among other things develop safer or more effective products  implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing  develop less costly products  obtain quicker regulatory approval  have access to more manufacturing capacity  form more advantageous strategic alliances  or establish superior proprietary positions 
in addition  if we receive regulatory approvals  we may compete with well established  fda approved therapies that have generated substantial sales over a number of years 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding other cancer therapies continue to accelerate 
we have no experience in commercializing products on our own and  to the extent we do not develop this ability or contract with a third party to assist us  we may not be able to successfully sell our product candidates 
we do not have a sales and marketing force and may not be able to develop this capacity 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities  we will need to enter into sales and marketing agreements to market our products in the united states 
for sales outside the united states  we plan to enter into third party arrangements 
in these foreign markets  if we are unable to establish successful distribution relationships with pharmaceutical companies  we may fail to realize the full sales potential of our product candidates 
additionally  our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate will depend on a number of factors  including establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness of a product  its potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  and marketing and distribution support for the product 
moreover  government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new medical products and services 
consequently  uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics and diagnostics 
for these and other reasons  physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any product candidates that we develop and even if they do  reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development

legislative actions  potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse  unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and may occur again in the future and as a result we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies 
compliance with new regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and insurance costs are increasing as a result of this uncertainty and other factors 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from science and business activities to compliance activities 
our stock price may be volatile and our shares may suffer a decline in value
