item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation future uncertainties this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve material risks and uncertainties 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with a warning about forward looking statements on page of this annual report 
overview we are a worldwide leader in developing  manufacturing and marketing poc rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and management of a variety of medical conditions and illnesses 
our current product areas include pregnancy  infectious diseases  autoimmune diseases  osteoporosis and urinalysis 
in the us  we lead the market in several poc product categories for sales through medical product distributors 
this leadership position includes an estimated  and market share in pregnancy  influenza and group a strep products  respectively  as of december  our products provide healthcare professionals with accurate and cost effective diagnostic information at the poc 
we sell our products to professionals for use in physician offices  hospitals  clinical laboratories and wellness screening centers 
we focus our products substantially on women s and family health in areas such as reproduction  infectious diseases  general health screening and diseases associated with the elderly 
we commenced our operations in and launched our first products  dipstick based pregnancy tests  in our product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal development and acquisitions of other products and technologies 
the current product areas are pregnancy  infectious diseases  autoimmune diseases  osteoporosis and urinalysis  for professional and research use 
we market our products in the us through a network of national and regional distributors  supported by a direct sales force 
in the rest of the world  we sell and market through distributors in asia pacific  europe  the middle east  africa and latin america and in other international locations by channeling products through distributor organizations and sales agents 
product announcements in september  our quickvue influenza a b test received regulatory clearance from the fda  allowing for this test to be sold in the us the test received approval from the japanese ministry of health and welfare in january in february  we announced that our new quickvue r influenza a b test had been granted a clia waiver from the fda 
the test provides physicians with a fast  accurate  easy to use method for aiding in the differential diagnosis of acute influenza type a or b 
the quickvue influenza a b test is a companion to the currently marketed  clia waived quickvue influenza test  which has been available worldwide since iso certification in december  our san diego facility became iso certified for our quality management systems 
these systems contribute to ensuring that the development  manufacture and supply of products and services are consistent  reliable and valuable in meeting the quality demands of customers 
iso certification is officially recognized by european and north american authorities and is accepted worldwide  and is a requirement for doing business in the european union 
additionally  our santa clara facility was iso certified prior to our acquisition of litmus and both the san diego and santa clara facilities were successfully recertified during  and results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data year ended december  revenues net sales research contracts  license fees and royalty income total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses operating earnings other income expense other income interest and other expense total other income expense earnings before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net earnings net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for our influenza and group a strep products  offset primarily by decreases in our pregnancy products 
the significantly greater demand for our influenza products during the third and fourth quarters of was largely driven by a severe flu season 
our influenza and group a strep product sales increased approximately million and million  respectively  while our pregnancy tests decreased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for our influenza products  offset by decreases in our pregnancy  group a strep and h 
pylori products 
our influenza product sales increased approximately million  while our core products of pregnancy and group a strep tests decreased approximately million and our h 
pylori product sales decreased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  distribution developments and trends a significant portion of our us sales is made to distribution partners 
we offer various incentives  largely through volume discount programs  to certain of these distributors based on sales objectives developed with the distributor 
we also provide incentives from time to time for jointly developed sales and marketing programs 
as a result of a recent marketing strategy developed for our influenza and group a strep product lines  we increased sales of these products during the second quarter of even though sales for influenza and group a strep have historically been heavily weighted in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
the program was intended to build brand loyalty by incentivizing end users to purchase our products in advance of the fall and winter months  thereby facilitating repurchases of the same products as usage increases during the year 
we do not anticipate this marketing approach to adversely impact expected aggregate sales in any future period 
our sales estimates for future periods are based on estimated end user demand for our products 
sales to our distribution partners would fall short of expectations if distributor inventories increase because of less than estimated end user consumption 
with the introduction of low cost pregnancy test products by competitors  we have observed a decline in us sales of our own pregnancy products over the past several quarters 
given current estimates of existing distributor inventories and a shortfall in end user demand as compared to sales to distributors to date  we believe that our us sales of pregnancy products may decline in the near future 
our estimated future growth  therefore  is based on significant increases in sales of our other products 
as discussed under the restructuring section below  the transition from direct sales to independent distribution in germany and italy was largely completed as of december  we believe that continued market penetration will offset the revenue decline resulting from this distribution change 
research contracts  license fees and royalty income research contracts  license fees and royalty income remained constant at approximately million for the years ended december   and the majority of the research contracts  license fees and royalty income relates to royalty payments received on a patented technology of ours utilized by a third party 
the agreement covering the royalty payments extends through november  the expiration date of the patent 
cost of sales and gross profit from net sales gross profit from net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increases were primarily due to increased sales volume and favorable product mix  offset to a lesser extent by under utilization of manufacturing capacity at our marburg  germany facility  as well as pricing pressures on our pregnancy products 
gross profit from net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from net sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases were primarily due to under utilization of manufacturing capacity at our marburg  germany facility due to the delayed shipment of our urinquick instrument and its related effect on urine test strip sales as well as pricing pressures on our core products  partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin influenza products 
research and development expense research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for the years ended december  and the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to increased spending for the development of products on our ltf technology platform related to personnel and laboratory supplies and increased legal fees associated with patent development and patent protection 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained constant at for both the years ended december  and the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to increased spending for the development of new products on our ltf technology platform related to personnel and laboratory supplies 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase relates primarily to costs associated with our market analysis and investment in our national outreach and educational promotion of our influenza test  including public relations  marketing and advertising fees 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increases relate primarily to costs associated with the launch of our infectious vaginitis products  bone ultrasonometer and urinalysis instrument  including infrastructure  public relations  marketing and consulting fees 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to increased professional fees relating to the re audit of our financial statements  tax consulting fees and legal and professional fees 
general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decreases were primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with corporate merger and acquisition activity in  partially offset by increased legal and professional fees in restructuring in april  we announced and implemented the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan was primarily driven by manufacturing automation in our san diego facility  completion of certain research and development projects  implementation of our baan enterprise resource planning system in our santa clara facility  and the transition of our foreign sales and support offices to independent distributors 
the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of positions of our total workforce at such time and closure of our sales and support offices in heidelberg  germany and milan  italy 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million during the significant components of the restructuring charge were million for employee severance costs  million for contractual lease and commercial contract terminations  million for professional fees  and million for impairment charges related to assets that were deemed obsolete due to restructuring activities 
as of december   million of the restructuring charge had been paid and million is included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in the first quarter of  we implemented an expense reduction plan the reduction plan 
the reduction plan included a workforce reduction of approximately employees and closure of our facilities in the united kingdom 
in the first quarter of  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the reduction plan 
the significant components of the reduction plan were million for employee severance costs and million in closing costs related to the united kingdom facility 
the reduction plan was completed as of the end of the first quarter march  and no amounts were accrued as of december  amortization of intangibles on january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
upon adoption  we reclassified the net book value of our assembled workforce intangible at january   which totaled million  to goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible for the year ended december  totaled million 
sfas no 
required a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances on adoption of the new accounting pronouncement 
we completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at january   and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
sfas no 
also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows  a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  and any significant change in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets are among many factors that could result in an impairment charge that could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our other intangible assets  which are being amortized over a period of three to years  include purchased technology  license agreements  patents  trademarks and a favorable lease 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  amortization of non goodwill intangibles decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the adoption of sfas no 
in january and the resulting elimination of goodwill amortization for and periods thereafter 
other income other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in relates primarily to gains recognized on disposal of assets throughout the year 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a gain of million recognized in related to recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds on a freezer malfunction in may the million gain is net of million of insurance proceeds  offset by a million loss for damaged inventory and million of expenses for certain business remedies 
interest and other expense interest and other expense remained constant at million for both the years ended december  and interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on obligations under capital leases  which are primarily related to our san diego facility 
interest and other expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in our average borrowings outstanding under our line of credit during income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  versus a tax provision of million for the year ended december  this change is due primarily to a decrease of million in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the fourth quarter ended december  to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized  and to a lesser extent  foreign operations for both periods 
based on our recent history of profitability and our forecasts for future periods  management has determined it is more likely than not that net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences will be realized 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates differed from the applicable statutory rates due primarily to our foreign operations for both periods and goodwill amortization during liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our line of credit 
our principal requirements for cash currently are for the funding of operations and capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at december  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was million  the components of which are discussed below 
the cash generated from operating activities of million is largely comprised of our net earnings of million  non cash expenses of million related to depreciation and amortization  a decrease in inventories of million and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable and our deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively 
another source of cash during the period was million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock option plans 
our primary uses of cash for the year ended december  were acquisitions of manufacturing equipment and assets related to information technology of million  as well as payments on obligations under capital leases totaling million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was million  the components of which are discussed below 
the cash generated from operating activities of million is largely comprised of our net earnings of million  non cash expenses of million related to depreciation and amortization and decreases in our deferred tax asset of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
another source of cash during the period was million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock option plans 
our primary uses of cash for the year ended december  were acquisitions of manufacturing equipment and assets related to information technology of million  as well as payments on our line of credit and obligations under capital leases totaling million 
we have a million term loan facility which matures in july and which bears interest at a rate equal to the lender s base rate minus one quarter of one percent 
we also have a million line of credit facility which matures in july and  at our option  bears interest at a rate equal to the lender s base rate minus one quarter of one percent or at the london interbank offering rate plus two and one quarter percent 
the agreements governing our line of credit and term loan facilities contain certain customary covenants restricting our ability to  among other matters  incur additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  make investments  loans and guarantees or sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under either the line of credit or the term loan 
as of december   we had million of availability both under the line of credit and term loan  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
we plan approximately million in capital expenditures during the primary purpose for our capital expenditures is to acquire manufacturing equipment and information technology 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we have approximately million of firm purchase commitments with respect to such planned expenditures as of the date of this filing 
these commitments largely related to manufacturing equipment for our ltf product line 
we also intend to continue evaluation of acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  we may need to incur additional debt  or sell additional equity  to successfully complete these acquisitions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we generate cash from operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet operating needs during the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations our facilities and certain equipment are leased under noncancelable capital and operating leases 
in addition  we have contractual commitments for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment with certain vendors during as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations    fixed asset purchase obligations   total      reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under capital leases  including current maturities  in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
reflects obligations on facilities and equipment under operating leases in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
amounts represent our minimum purchase commitments from vendors for manufacturing equipment used in our manufacturing facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we record revenues from product sales 
these revenues are recorded net of rebates and other discounts which are estimated at the time of sale  and are largely driven by various customer program offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revenue from product sales are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
title to the product and recognition of revenue passes upon delivery to the customer when sales terms are fob destination and at the time of shipment when the sales terms are fob shipping point 
we also earn income from the licensing of technology and may earn income for performing services under joint development agreements 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recorded during the period the cash is received from the licensee 
milestone payments  which may arise under joint development agreements  would be recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
income earned from licensing and distribution activities are classified under revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we are not currently performing services under any joint development agreements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and adversely impact our reported results 
our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand  we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and adversely impact net operating results in the future 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  any volatility or significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to our net book value  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of our assets  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we reclassified the net book value of our assembled workforce intangible  which totaled million  to goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
the elimination of amortization relating to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles had a positive impact on net earnings for each of the years ended december  and of approximately million 
sfas no 
requires a transitional evaluation for impairment of goodwill balances upon adoption of the new accounting pronouncement 
we completed our transitional review for potential impairment of goodwill that existed at january   and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
sfas no 
also requires periodic evaluations for impairment of goodwill balances 
we completed our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill in december  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december  a valuation allowance of million had been established against a portion of our deferred tax assets at december  as of december   we believed it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the majority of our deferred tax asset through expected future taxable profits  and released a valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to deferred tax assets created by the exercise and or disposition of employee stock options in recent periods 
the deferred tax asset originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options and the related valuation allowance have been recorded against additional paid in capital and did not affect net earnings for the period 
any tax benefits realized from the reduction of this valuation allowance will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our other components of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination were made 
we also reserve for taxes that may become payable as a result of audits in future periods with respect to previously filed tax returns 
it is our policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
we establish the reserves based on our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the guidance provided by eitf is effective for contracts entered into on or after july  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for annual periods ending after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
is an amendment to sfas no 
providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
amendments are effective for our financial statements ended december  we have currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if we should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
fin is effective for variable interest entities created after january  fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by us if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of future currency exchange rate fluctuations  which is accounted for as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations and have historically not been material 
nonetheless  changes from reporting period to reporting period in the exchange rates between various foreign currencies and the us dollar have had and will continue to have an impact on the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity reported by us  and such effect in the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries may become material in a reporting period 
the fair market value of floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december  and  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates
