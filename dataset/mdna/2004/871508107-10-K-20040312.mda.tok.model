overview we are a leader in secure mobile information systems that integrate application specific handheld computers with wireless networks for data  voice and bar code data capture 
our goal is to be one of the world s preeminent suppliers of mission critical mobile computing solutions to both business and industrial users 
for the year ended december   we generated  of revenue 
symbol manufactures products and provides services to capture  manage and communicate data using four core technologies bar code reading and image recognition  mobile computing  networking systems and mobility software applications 
our products and services are sold to a broad and diverse base of customers on a worldwide basis and in diverse markets such as retail  transportation  parcel and postal delivery services  warehousing and distribution  manufacturing  healthcare  hospitality  security  education and government 
we do not depend upon a single customer  or a few customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are engaged in two reportable business segments the design  manufacture and marketing of mobile computing  automatic data capture  and wireless network systems the product segment  and the servicing of  customer support for and professional services related to these systems the services segment 
each of our operating segments uses its core competencies to provide building blocks for mobile computing solutions 
executive overview of performance our total revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of percent from total revenue of  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to gradual strengthening in the global economy and increased spending in the information technology sector which resulted in growth in our product segment  particularly in mobile computing 
our gross profit overall was percent for the year ended december   an increase from percent for the increase is primarily due to our sales of higher margin product and efficiencies we have achieved in our manufacturing and distribution operations 
also contributing to the improved operating results is the absence of several charges recorded during for the impairment of certain software assets  a provision for a loss contract  as well as severance  restructuring and warranty related charges 
these charges aggregated  in we have continued to incur costs related to our restatement and ongoing investigations 
such costs were approximately  or percent of our selling  general and administrative costs of  for the year ended december  as compared to  incurred in when the restatement and investigations were initiated 
with continued focus on our balance sheet  we have increased our cash to  at december   an increase of  from  at december   reducing our bank debt and senior notes by approximately  and ending december with no current borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we have also invested  in our business during through purchases of property and equipment as well as certain strategic acquisitions 
we continue to effectively manage our net accounts receivables  ending with  an increase of only from  at december  despite an increase in revenues during of  a key performance indicator we use to monitor our receivables collection is days sales outstanding 
through aggressive collection strategies we have been able to reduce our average days sales outstanding to days in from an average of days in we have also continued to improve our efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution operations and have decreased our inventory levels by  to  at december  from  at december  a key performance indicator used to monitor our inventory levels is inventory turnover 
as a result of the efficiencies we have instituted in our manufacturing and distribution operations we have been able to increase the average number of times per year that our inventory turns over to in from in results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain revenue and expense items expressed as a percentage of total net revenue

also contributing to the product revenue growth was growth in automatic data capture and wireless network systems 
net services revenue of  for the year ended december  increased percent from  reported in due to stronger period over period cash collections 
geographically  the americas revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of percent from the  reported in emea revenue of  increased percent for the year ended december  from  reported in asia pacific revenue increased percent for the year ended december  from  reported in the americas  emea and asia pacific represent approximately  and percent of revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net product revenue for the year ended december  decreased percent to  from  for this decline was due to unfavorable global economic conditions and reduced levels of information technology spending which resulted in a reduction in the quantity of units sold 
net services revenue for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  for  primarily due to an increase in support service contract renewals and time and materials billings  particularly in our emea region associated with product sales offset partially by decrease in project management activities in as compared to geographically  the americas and emea revenue decreased percent and percent  respectively  for the year ended december  from the comparable prior year period 
asia pacific revenue increased percent over the comparable prior year period 
the americas  emea  and asia pacific revenue represent approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of net revenue in the slowdown in the us and emea economy  along with customer constraints on information technology spending  were the main causes for the decline in our revenue

      services cost of revenue as a percentage of services revenue services gross profit percent for the year ended december  product cost of revenue as a percentage of net product revenue was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent in this decrease is due to an overall shift in product mix to higher margin products  increased manufacturing absorption due to higher sales volumes and increased efficiencies gained in our manufacturing and distribution operations 
contributing to the improved cost structure is the absence of the following charges an  impairment charge related to manufacturing equipment software  a  provision for a loss contract  severance charges of  additional warranty costs of  and other restructuring related costs of  also contributing to the lower costs as a percentage of net product revenue is the sale in the fourth quarter of of approximately  of inventory that had previously been reserved for 
services cost of revenue as a percentage of net services revenue was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent in the majority of the decrease is due to the efficiencies gained from the consolidation and elimination of repair centers as well as increased revenue due to the timing of cash collections 
for the year ended december  product cost of revenue as a percentage of net product revenue was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent in this decrease is mainly attributed to charges for excess and obsolete inventory of  in as compared to  in  partially offset by several restructuring and impairment related charges aggregating  in services cost of revenue as a percentage of net services revenue was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent in the decrease in the services cost of revenue as a percentage of net services revenue resulted primarily from cost containment efforts and cost benefits derived from the elimination of duplicate overhead components  including the closure of four service centers and elimination of redundant workforce resulting from the telxon acquisition 
engineering and selling  general and administrative expenses are summarized in the following table for the years ended december variance in variance in variance in variance in dollars percent dollars percent engineering       percent of net sales selling  general and administrative       percent of net sales operating expenses for the year ended december  total operating expenses of  increased percent for the year ended december  from  in these increases are largely driven by accounting consequences related to our stock based compensation plans which resulted in a recovery of  in but additional costs of  for the year ended december  also contributing to the increased operating expenses are costs associated with our restatement and the ongoing government investigation as further described below 
included in total operating expenses  and as more fully described in our note to the consolidated financial statements are amounts associated with non cash compensation expenses associated with our stock option plans 
such amounts were expenses of  and recoveries of  for the year ended december  as of march   due to the inability of symbol to make timely filings with the commission  our stock option plans were held in abeyance  meaning that our employees could not exercise their options until we became current with our filings 
as an accommodation to both current and former symbol associates whose options were impacted by this suspension  the compensation committee of the board approved an abeyance program that allowed associates whose options were affected during the suspension period the right to exercise such options up to days after the end of the suspension period 
this resulted in a new measurement date for those options  which led to a non cash accounting compensation charge for the intrinsic value of those vested options when the employee either terminated employment during the suspension period or within the day period after the end of the suspension period 
on february   the date on which we became current with our regulatory filings with the sec  this suspension period ended 
in addition  due to our delinquent filings with the sec  we incurred non cash compensation expenses associated with our employee stock purchase plan espp as the espp lost its exempt tax status 
engineering costs for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  for the increase was due to the acquisition of covigo to expand our software solutions offerings  and continued investment in our product offerings 
the increase was consistent with projected and actual revenue growth as engineering spending as a percentage of revenue remained relatively consistent in the percent range 
the increased spending was spread across all product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  for the increase was attributable to additional professional fees associated with our internal investigation as well as higher variable costs due to a percent increase in revenues  partially offset by the absence of a  pre tax severance charge recorded in for our former president and chief executive officer 
in early we initiated a review of certain accounting and financial matters with the assistance of an independent counsel and an outside accounting firm 
as a result of this investigation we incurred additional professional fees of  in as compared with  incurred in the increase was also attributable to severance costs incurred during aggregating approximately  primarily for the reorganization and releveling of the international sales organization 
excluding the restatement and investigation costs from both and  the severance costs from and the executive compensation and benefits charge from  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  primarily due to higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the above mentioned items  increased to percent in as compared to percent in as more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we continue to negotiate with regard to the investigations and our outstanding class action lawsuits 
during the quarter ended march  we recorded a  loss provision for legal settlements as compared to a charge in the quarter ended december  of  in november  we reached a tentative settlement of certain litigation related to telxon  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  enabling us to quantify our likely liability 
reflected in total operating expenses and more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a charge of  related to these matters  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of operating expenses for the year ended december  engineering costs for the year ended december  decreased percent to  from  for the decrease is due to cost containment arrangements to keep spending in line with reduced revenue expectations  and an increase in engineering cost sharing efforts with certain of our customers 
as a percentage of total net revenue  engineering expenses increased slightly to percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  for the increase is attributed to the additional professional fees of  associated with our internal investigation and the severance charge of  recorded in for our former president and chief executive officer 
excluding the investigation costs and executive compensation and benefits charge  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased percent to  from  for higher costs were incurred in in anticipation of increased sales activity related to our telxon acquisition in november as the increased sales activity did not materialize to the extent anticipated  cost reduction programs were initiated in as a percentage of total net revenue  selling general and administrative expenses excluding the investigation costs and the executive compensation and benefits charge increased to percent for the year ended december  from percent in as more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we continue to negotiate with regard to the investigations and our outstanding class action lawsuits 
during the quarter ended december  we recorded a  loss provision for legal settlements 
also  in november we reached a tentative settlement of certain litigation related to telxon  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  enabling us to quantify our likely liability 
reflected in total operating expenses is a charge of  related to these matters  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of no such charges were recorded in during the year ended december   we also incurred restructuring charges of  primarily related to workforce reductions resulting from the transition of our volume manufacturing operations from our bohemia  new york facility to lower cost locations  primarily our reynosa  mexico facility and far east contract manufacturing partners 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in a business combination will no longer be amortized into results of operations  but rather be subject to assessment for impairment at least annually 
under sfas no 
 we are required to perform a prescribed fair value based test to measure any impairment to our goodwill and other intangible assets 
we completed the impairment test as of january  utilizing an independent appraisal and comparing the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
based on the results of these comparisons  we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill related to either of our reporting units upon initial adoption of this statement 
subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas no 
 we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing on september th of each year beginning in we completed the impairment test as of september  and using the same methodology as described above 
the results indicated no impairment of goodwill related to either of our reporting units at september  and  respectively 
adjusted financial information assuming sfas no 
had been adopted as of january  is as follows for the year ended december  net earnings loss  as reported    goodwill amortization  net of tax  adjusted net loss earnings    basic loss per share net loss  as reported goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted net loss earnings diluted loss per share net loss as reported goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted net loss earnings other expense income interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  or percent from  in primarily due to reduced debt levels as a result of the repurchase in of telxon s remaining convertible debt  net repayments under our revolving credit facility and annual mandatory repayments of other indebtedness  without incurring any new borrowings in or interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  or percent from  in primarily due to reduced debt levels 
interest income for the year ended december  increased percent to  from  for  primarily due to the investments of additional cash from operations into overnight deposits with local banks  primarily in our non us locations 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased percent to  from  for primarily due to lower cash balances available for very short term investments particularly during the first half of we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our investments for impairment 
in consideration of the financial outlook of airclic s business  the general decline in the economy and the decline in information technology spending  it was determined that the decline in the value of our investment in airclic was other than temporary during the quarter ended june  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  which is included in impairment of investments as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations  and wrote down the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value of  we evaluated the decline in market value of our investment in cisco common stock 
based on the then current market conditions  it was determined that an other than temporary decline in the market value of this investment had occurred as of september  our conclusion was based on the fact that cisco common stock had been trading substantially below our historical cost for eight months as of september   with no clear evidence at the time that its trading price would recover to our historical cost 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  a pre tax impairment charge of  was included in impairment of investments as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recognized a pretax loss of  relating to several other investments in marketable securities 
we determined that market value declines in these investments to be other than temporary 
this loss is included in impairment of investments and is included as a component of other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the portion of our investment in cisco common stock classified as trading  coupled with the gain or loss of the change in fair value of the embedded derivative  have been recorded as a component of other expense income in each reporting period 
the net impact of these fair value adjustments resulted in other expense income of  for   for  and  for on april  we designated a portion of the embedded equity collar as a fair value hedge of our cisco shares classified as available for sale securities 
since the collar was effective  the change in the fair value of cisco shares classified as available for sale of  was recorded as other income 
our effective income tax rate was percent for the effective tax rate each year is largely impacted by the ratio of items receiving different treatment for tax and accounting purposes to profit loss before taxes 
in  the effective rate was reduced by the impact of research and experimentation credits and export sales benefits partially offset by valuation allowances and nondeductible items 
our effective income tax rate was percent for as the favorable impact of tax credits was more than offset by additional valuation allowances and the unfavorable impact of non deductible compensation expenses 
our effective income tax rate was percent in as the favorable impact of tax credits was more than offset by state tax provisions and the non tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill as well as additional valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources amount in thousands currently  our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations and the secured credit agreement 
our primary liquidity requirements continue to be for working capital  engineering costs  and financing and investing activities 
cash flows from operations in and have been sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and we believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
during  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of  and experienced an overall increase in cash of  the positive cash flow provided by operating activities as well as the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants and the employee stock purchase plan were used to repay long term debt  purchase property  plant and equipment  invest in new companies and other assets  repurchase our common stock  and pay dividends 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to  a percent improvement from the  reported in the improvement was primarily attributable to improved gross profit margins as well as continued improvement in managing receivables and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  a percent increase from  reported in primarily resulting from increased purchases of property  plant and equipment due to investments made in administrative software and systems to enhance our back office capabilities and improve customer service 
over the next months we expect to continue to make investments in property  plant and equipment in the range of  cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  a percent decrease from  reported in as a result of lower debt repayments in during the company paid off in full its remaining obligation under its convertible notes and debentures and in paid off in full its remaining obligations under its revolving credit facility 
during  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of  and experienced an overall increase in cash of  the positive cash flow provided by operating activities  proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants and the employee stock purchase plan  and proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment were used to repurchase convertible notes and debentures  repay other long term debt  purchase property  plant and equipment  invest in new companies and other assets  repurchase our common stock  and pay dividends 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to  from a use of cash of  for primarily as a result of improved operating gross profit  as well as lower cash payments on trade payables 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  increased to  from  for as a result of the absence of proceeds received in of  from the termination of a collar arrangement associated with our investment in cisco common stock partially offset by lower purchases of property  plant and equipment in in addition to our secured credit agreement  we have additional uncommitted loan agreements with various overseas banks pursuant to which the banks have agreed to provide lines of credit totaling  with a range of borrowing rates and varying terms 
as of december   we had no loans outstanding under these lines 
these agreements continue until such time as either party terminates the agreements 
other liquidity measures other measures of our liquidity including the following year ended december  working capital    current assets minus current liabilities current ratio current assets to current liabilities long term debt to capital convertible subordinated notes and debentures plus long term debt to convertible subordinated notes and debentures plus long term debt plus equity current assets as of december  increased by  from december   principally due to an increase in cash due to improved cash flows from operations partially offset by a decrease in inventories due to improved inventory management techniques 
current liabilities as of december  increased  from december  primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of which  was an additional liability established in for settlements of certain shareholder litigation and government investigations 
as a result  working capital decreased  between december  and december  our current ratio of at december  decreased from at december  the decline in working capital and the current ratio as of december  as compared to december  continues a trend in the decline of these liquidity measures reported for december  as compared to december  the primary factors contributing to this trend are a decline in inventory balances of  as of december  due to improved inventory management techniques and a decline in deferred income taxes from  as of december  also contributing to the trend in these declining liquidity measures is an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses from  as of december  primarily as a result of net liabilities established in both and of  and  respectively  for various legal settlements 
these declines were partially offset by increased cash balances as a result of improved cash flow from operations in both and our long term debt to capital ratio decreased to percent at december   from percent at december   primarily due to the repayment in full of all outstanding convertible subordinated notes and debentures and a reduction in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the sails exchangeable debt arrangement 
financing activities during  we entered into a  lease receivable securitization agreement 
this agreement matured on december   but was renewed for an additional three months without the payment of amounts outstanding at such time 
subsequent to december   we have been unable to securitize additional lease receivables until we provide certain financial information to the financial institution 
during the years ended december  and  we securitized approximately  and  respectively  of lease receivables which resulted in up front proceeds from new securitizations of  and  respectively 
factors that are reasonably likely to affect our ability to continue using these financing arrangements include the ability to generate lease receivables that qualify for securitization and the ability of the financial institution to obtain an investment grade rating from either of the two major credit rating agencies 
we do not consider the securitization of lease receivables to be a significant contributing factor to our continued liquidity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
existing indebtedness at december  and  long term debt outstanding  excluding current maturities  was as follows december  december  in thousands revolving credit facility  senior notes  sails exchangeable debt   other less current maturities  long term debt   at the time of the telxon acquisition  telxon had outstanding  of percent convertible subordinated notes the notes  and  of percent convertible subordinated debentures the debentures 
the notes were redeemable at any time at the option of telxon at percent of par value and the debentures were redeemable at par value 
during  we redeemed portions of the notes and debentures and in we redeemed the remaining outstanding balances 
in march  we issued  of our percent senior notes due february  the senior notes 
the remaining balance of the senior notes of  is classified as current at december  and was fully repaid in february in january  we entered into a private mandatorily exchangeable securities contract for shared appreciation income linked securities sails with a highly rated financial institution 
the securities that underlie the sails contract represent our investment in cisco common stock  which was acquired in connection with the telxon acquisition 
the  shares of cisco common stock had a market value of  at december  and  at december  such shares are held as collateral to secure the debt instrument associated with the sails and are included in investment in marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
this debt has a seven year maturity and pays interest at a cash coupon rate of percent 
at maturity  the sails will be exchangeable for shares of cisco common stock or  at our option  cash in lieu of shares 
net proceeds from the issuance of the sails and termination of an existing freestanding collar arrangement were approximately  which were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the sails contain an embedded equity collar  which effectively hedges a large portion of exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of our holdings in cisco common stock 
we account for the embedded equity collar as a derivative financial instrument in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 sfas 
the gain or loss on changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized through earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the cisco shares classified as trading securities 
as a result of the april  designation of a portion of the embedded equity collar as a fair value hedge of our cisco common stock classified as available for sale securities  changes in the fair value of those securities between accounting periods are recorded in other income expense to the extent the embedded collar is effective 
the derivative has been combined with the debt instrument in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets and presented on a net basis as permitted under fin no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  as there exists a legal right of offset 
the sails liability  net of the derivative asset  represents  at december  the remaining portion of long term debt outstanding relates to capital lease obligations and various other loans maturing through contractual cash obligations the following is a summary of the contractual commitments associated with our debt and lease obligations as of december  years ended december  total thereafter long term debt   capital lease commitments operating lease commitments        total        our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our secured credit agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our secured credit agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our other liquidity needs or pay our indebtedness 
if we consummate an acquisition  our liquidity and or debt service requirements could increase 
in our opinion  inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to product return reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts legal contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty reserves  useful lives of long lived assets  derivative instrument valuations and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies summarizes each of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  product return reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products and systems to end users for their own consumption  as well as to value added resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems or channel partners 
channel partners may provide a service or add componentry in order to resell our product to end users 
revenue from the direct sale of our products and systems to end users and oems is generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the recognition of revenues related to sales of our products or systems to our value added resellers is contingent upon the reseller s ability to pay for the product without reselling it to the end user 
sales to resellers that are financially sound are generally recognized when products are shipped  the title and risk of loss has passed  the sales prices is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to resellers that lack economic substance or cannot pay for our products without reselling them to their customers are recognized when the revenue is billed and collected 
revenue on sales to distributors is recognized when our products and systems are sold by them to the end user 
when a sale involves multiple elements  the entire revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 
we accrue estimated product return reserves against our recorded revenue 
the estimated amount is based on historical experience of similar products to our customers 
if our product mix or customer base changes significantly  this could result in a change to our future estimated product return reserve 
we record accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
throughout the year  we estimate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions for key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts receivable that we believe are uncollectible 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts receivable 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and current knowledge of potential collection problems provides us significant information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and accruals are established when we are able to estimate the probable outcome of these matters 
such estimates of outcome are derived from consultation with outside legal counsel  as well as an assessment of litigation and settlement strategies 
legal contingencies are often resolved over long time periods 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
depending on how these matters are resolved  these costs could be material 
inventory valuation we record our inventories at the lower of historical cost or market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of recorded amounts  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
projected demand levels  economic conditions  business restructurings  technological innovation and product life cycles are variables we assess when determining our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due to these variables 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is further deterioration in market conditions or acceleration in technological change 
warranty reserves we provide standard warranty coverage for most of our products for a period of one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty claims based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
this liability primarily includes the anticipated cost of materials  labor and shipping necessary to repair and service the equipment 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates  and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should our warranty policy change or should actual failure rates  material usage and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
useful lives of long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable finite life intangible assets and software development costs for internal use in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the estimated lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into consideration anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly or slowly than anticipated  or in a different form  useful lives may need to be changed accordingly  resulting in either an increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
we review these assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and cash flows and significant negative economic trends 
derivative instruments  hedging activities and foreign currency we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk exposures related to foreign currency denominated payments from our international subsidiaries 
we also utilize a derivative financial instrument to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of our investment in cisco common shares 
our foreign exchange derivatives qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  or if we did not believe the forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings and could be material 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our hedging activities as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates  that if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the reported income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  and other available evidence 
our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
this interpretation requires that the assets  liabilities  and results of activities of a variable interest entity vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling interest in the vie 
fin r also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
for entities acquired or created before february   this interpretation is effective no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march   except for those vie s that are considered to be special purpose entities  for which the effective date is no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  the company does not hold any significant interests in vie s that would require consolidation or additional disclosures 
in november  the eitf reached partial consensus on eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on the new requirements for other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and marketable equity investments that are accounted for under sfas no 
the new requirements on disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the implementation of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of our business 
currently  we do not use any financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
the counterparties in derivative transactions that we have entered into are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating services 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany sales 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected as a component of operating results in our consolidated statements of operations 
a large percentage of our sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   a five percent strengthening of the us dollar against every applicable foreign currency would have had a  negative impact on our revenues for the year ended december  while a five percent weakening of the us dollar against every applicable foreign currency would have had a  positive impact on our revenues we did not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected revenues for the year ended december  however  we acquire a portion of our raw materials using local currencies 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against local currency would act as a partial offset to the impact on revenues 
we manufacture a significant portion of our products at our mexico facility and we generally invoice our international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods 
as a result  our annual us dollar cash flow is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   a five percent strengthening of the us dollar against every applicable currency would have had a  negative impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from our subsidiaries during the year ended december  while a five percent weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency would have had a  positive impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from our subsidiaries 
we routinely use foreign exchange contracts to hedge cash flows that are either firm commitments or those which may be forecasted to occur 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  we currently depend on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for several components of our equipment  certain subassemblies and certain of our products 
this may have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our products or to deliver them on time or to manufacture them at anticipated cost levels 
however  due to the general availability of components and supplies  we do not believe that the loss of any supplier or subassembly manufacturer would have a long term material adverse effect on our business  although set up costs and delays could occur in the short term if we changed any single source supplier 
substantially all of our debt outstanding at december  is us dollar denominated at fixed rates of interest 
during  we did not use interest rate derivatives to protect our exposure to interest rate market movements 
we currently hold an investment in cisco common stock  which is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
at december   approximately  shares are classified as trading and shares are classified as available for sale securities 
they are carried at fair market value based on their quoted market price 
as such  we have exposure to market risk related to the fluctuation of cisco s stock price 
however  the change in fair value of the cisco stock price is mitigated by the change in fair value of the embedded equity collar contained in the sails arrangement 
as of december   a percent increase decrease in the risk free interest rate used to value the option would have a negative positive earnings impact of approximately  while a percent increase decrease in the assumed volatility used to value the option would have a positive negative earnings impact of approximately
