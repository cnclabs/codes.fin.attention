item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview entegris  inc is a leading provider of materials integrity management products and services that protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia and europe 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last saturday of august 
the last three fiscal years ended on the following dates august   august  and august  fiscal years and included weeks  while fiscal comprised weeks 
fiscal years are identified in this report according to the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended august  is alternatively referred to as fiscal or forward looking statements the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  except for the historical information  contains forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements could differ materially from actual results 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or updates to these forward looking statements to reflect future events or unanticipated occurrences 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which are included elsewhere in this report 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc include the level of sales 
since a large portion of the company s product costs excepting raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affects certain costs such as incentive compensation  commissions and donations  all of which are highly variable in nature 
the variable margin on sales  which is determined by selling prices and the cost of manufacturing and raw materials  has a large effect on profit 
this factor is affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sale mix  purchase prices of raw material  especially resin  purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
the company s fixed cost structure is significant 
accordingly  increases or decreases in these costs have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor  and benefits  and depreciation and amortization 
thus changes in amounts or usage of these cost components can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of fiscal financial results net sales in fiscal increased by over the prior year 
this sales improvement was principally driven by the stronger order and sales activity for the company s semiconductor market product lines 
the company s higher sales were associated with the continuation of improving industry and global economic conditions throughout fiscal primarily due to the leverage associated with the higher sales  the company reported higher gross profits and operating income for the year 
partly offsetting the improvement in gross margin were increased selling  general and administrative expenses and engineering  research and development expenses as described below  although both categories rose at rates lower than the aforementioned sales increases 
as a result  the company reported greater net income for the year when compared to a year ago 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  and 
table of contents income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable related valuation accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as reserves for sales returns and allowances  and warranty claims 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management analyzes the age of receivable balances  historical bad debts write off experience  industry and geographic concentrations of customers  general customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both august  and august  a reserve for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at august  and august   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in the company s warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at august  and august   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
both figures include million in warranty liabilities recorded in connection with a fiscal acquisition 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or are reserved for fully 
in addition  reserves are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory reserves were million at august  compared to million at august  the company s inventories comprise materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current analyses  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and 
table of contents significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value  the company s marketable equity securities are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other than temporary  requiring an impairment loss to be recorded and the investment written down to a new cost basis 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings in its international operations  therefore  no us tax expense has been recorded to cover the repatriation of such undistributed earnings 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
the company carried no valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at either august  or august  results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for fiscal year  and the company s historical financial data were derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflected continued improvement in the semiconductor industry and general economic conditions 
the sales improvement was principally driven by the improved sales of the company s semiconductor market product lines 
in addition  sales associated with the company s efforts to expand its materials integrity management expertise into new applications and expanded markets resulted in improved sales 
the company estimates that approximately one fifth of the sales increase for was associated with the sales generated by businesses or product lines acquired in the second quarter of fiscal for which no sales were recorded in the year ago period prior to the dates of the acquisitions 
net sales for fiscal also included favorable foreign currency effects  primarily related to the strengthening of the japanese yen  in the amounts of approximately million 
the following table summarizes total net sales by markets served for and  along with the year to year percentage change in thousands percent change net sales semiconductor data storage services other the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for  compared to about in the prior year 
sales of semiconductor products rose by from to unit driven product lines such as wafer shippers  and test  assembly and packaging products saw sales improvements in the range 
sales of capital spending driven products  such as wafer and reticle carrier products and fluid handling products  experienced sales gains generally exceeding year over year 
the company s data storage products accounted for about of consolidated net sales in  compared to a year ago 
year over year sales increased by as customers experienced a well publicized overbuild of hard disk drives in the later part of fiscal the overall market growth outlook for data storage remains positive  particularly as consumer products are increasingly starting to use disk drives to store data 
services market sales rose from fiscal and accounted for of entegris overall sales  compared to about a year ago 
this increase mainly reflects growth in both the company s sales of its on and off site cleaning services 
sales of equipment used to clean wafer  disk carrier and shipping products were essentially flat with those of a year earlier 
about of overall sales for the year were generated in the life science market 
sales increased by from fiscal  about three quarters of which was due to higher sales recorded by electrol specialties  a market leader in clean in place technology  which was acquired by the company in january on a geographic basis  entegris fiscal sales in north america were of total sales  in asia pacific  in europe and in japan 
primarily on the strength of improved semiconductor sales  year over year sales comparisons saw sales gains in excess of in all regions  with sales to asia pacific up over 
based on current order rates  industry analyst expectations and other information  the company expects that sales for the first quarter of fiscal will be to lower than sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  industry volatility and uncertain market conditions make it difficult to forecast for future quarters 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  the fiscal gross margin was  compared to in gross profit dollar gains were reported by both domestic and international operations 
the improvements in fiscal gross margin percentage figures were primarily the result of the increased leverage associated with the improved sales levels noted above  which resulted in higher production levels 

table of contents several factors combined to partially offset the benefit of the higher utilization of the company s production capacity in fiscal as was the case in the prior year  gross margin levels were adversely affected by the stronger sales of the company s life sciences market products  where gross margins are below those of the semiconductor and data storage markets 
in addition  for much of the year  the company expanded its manufacturing staffing levels to address the rapidly increasing sales demand 
as a consequence of adding and training a large number of personnel  primarily temporary employees  operational efficiencies were not fully optimized 
as a result  the company believes it incurred expenses at a somewhat higher level than normal  offsetting the company s improved factory utilization 
the fiscal gross margin comparison to the prior year also benefited from the absence of certain items included in fiscal results 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began the process  which it essentially completed early in fiscal  of moving a portion of its manufacturing to a build to order model  which enabled the reduction of finished goods inventory 
these actions led to significant under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs during that period  accounting for approximately million in reduced gross profit 
fiscal also included transition costs of approximately million related to the integration of the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquisition 
the company also incurred costs in connection with the consolidation of several facilities in fiscal as discussed above  the company does not provide guidance about fiscal sales levels 
however  in general  gross profit and gross margin variances mainly track the utilization of the company s production capacity associated with varying sales levels 
in addition  the company s gross margin will be dependent on its ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from 
this decline mainly reflects the leverage associated with the company s increase in net sales 
the year over year increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation  profit sharing and donation accruals reflecting the company s improved sales and profitability million  higher professional and consulting fees million  increased amortization expense million and compensation expense associated with the issuance of shares of restricted stock million 
related to the last item  the company changed a component of its long term equity based incentive programs by issuing fewer stock options and began issuing restricted stock grants 
under current accounting rules  the company is required to expense the intrinsic value of restricted stock grants over their four year graded vesting periods 
other charges the company incurred no other charges in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the relocation of its upland  california operations and certain workforce reductions 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  million for estimated losses for asset impairment and million for future lease commitments on the upland facility 
as of august   future cash outlays of million remained outstanding in connection with the aforementioned charge and are related to lease commitments  which run through july the company recorded a pre tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the favorable settlement of a portion of the future lease commitments included in the aforementioned charge 
engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses increased to million in as compared to million in despite the increase in er d expenses  such costs as a percent of net sales  decreased to from  mainly reflecting the company s higher net sales 
about million of the year over year increase in er d expenses was due to the incremental costs of er d activities associated with the company s january acquisition of the assets of electrol specialties company and its february acquisition of asyst technologies  inc s wafer and reticle carrier product lines 
in addition  million and million of the increase reflected the company s investment in the development of its fuel cell  and tape and reel technologies  respectively 
the company er d efforts continued to focus on the support of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in compared to million in the decline reflects the lower rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities compared to the year ago period 
operating income loss operating income  stated as a percent of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to an operating loss  stated as a percent of net sales  of in fiscal the improvement in was mainly due to the leverage associated with increased sales levels  the effect of which was slightly offset by higher sg a and er d expenses as described above 

table of contents other income expense  net other income was million in fiscal compared to other expense of million in fiscal other income in fiscal included gains of million associated with the sale of an aggregate  shares of metron technology nv metron common stock made periodically over the course of fiscal other expense in included an impairment loss of million  or million after tax  related to the write down of the company s equity investment in metron common stock 
the company  a founding shareholder of metron  owned about million shares of metron common stock throughout prior to the impairment charge  the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a cost basis of million 
at november   the fair value of the investment was million  based on a price of per share  the closing price of metron at that date 
the decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
accordingly  an impairment loss of million was recorded and the investment in metron common stock written down to a new cost basis of million 
income tax expense benefit the company recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the main factor contributing to this variance is the company s improvement in earnings from operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate in fiscal is lower than the statutory federal rate of in the united states due to lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities  and a tax credit associated with research and development activities 
the income tax benefit for fiscal includes one time benefits of million from the redetermination of prior years taxes  million from the reversal of a valuation allowance on the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries  and million related to the impairment loss recorded on the company s investment in metron stock  as well as benefits associated with the factors noted above related to fiscal based on the current analysis of its tax situation  the company anticipates its effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately 
however  tax calculations are complex and sensitive to estimates of annual levels of profitability 
therefore  it is possible that there will be volatility in the company s tax rate 
in addition  the american jobs creation act of the act was passed in october and included numerous law changes that will affect the company s tax computations 
the provisions of the act include a new deduction for us manufacturers  the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a provision regarding the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the company is studying the new law to determine what impact  if any  the act will have on its effective tax rate 
net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the year ago period 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflected some improvement in the difficult business conditions that affected the semiconductor industry since the latter half of fiscal in addition  sales from acquired businesses and improved sales associated with the company s efforts to expand its materials integrity management expertise into new applications and new markets resulted in improved sales 
the following table summarizes total net sales by markets served for and  along with the year to year percentage change in thousands percent change net sales semiconductor data storage services other the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for  compared to about in the prior year 
sales of semiconductor products rose by from to sales for the company s microenvironment products doubled over the prior year  which included sales from the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquired in the second quarter 
this factor accounted for most of the overall increase in semiconductor market sales 
sales of wafer handling process products fell slightly year over year  as did sales of chemical containers 

table of contents the company s data storage products accounted for about of consolidated net sales in  compared to a year ago 
key customers in the industry implemented form factor and process changes during the latter part of  the major factor behind the increase in sales 
service business revenue  which accounted for about of entegris overall sales  rose compared to fiscal this increase reflects growth in both the company s sales of equipment  used to clean wafer and disk carriers and shipping products  and sales of its on and off site cleaning services 
about of overall sales for the year were generated in the life science market 
sales increased by from fiscal  about three quarters of which was due to sales recorded by electrol specialties  a market leader in clean in place technology  which was acquired by the company in january on a geographic basis  entegris total sales in north america were  in asia pacific  in europe and in japan 
year to year sales comparisons saw solid sales gains in europe  japan and asia pacific with essentially flat sales reported for north america 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal fiscal gross margin was  compared to in with the increase in sales from to  the company typically would have expected a higher gross margin for the year 
however  several factors combined to offset the benefit of the higher utilization of the company s production capacity  many of them significantly affecting the company in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  the company began the process of moving a portion of its manufacturing to a build to order model  which enabled the reduction of inventory 
however  these actions led to significant under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs during the quarter  accounting for approximately million in reduced gross profit 
among other factors was the consolidation of several facilities as the company moved its polymer material manufacturing operation from texas to malaysia  relocated its upland  california operations to chaska  minnesota and consolidated its cleaning equipment operations into the gilroy  california service center 
fiscal also included transition costs of approximately million related to the integration of the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquisition 
also negatively influencing margins were stronger sales in services and life sciences  two of the company s new markets  where gross margins for such products and services are below those of the semiconductor and data storage markets 
partly offsetting the declines was the benefit of the company s actions in reducing fixed costs and increasing manufacturing efficiencies associated with the closure of manufacturing plants  investing in automation  continuing process improvements and instituting manufacturing centers of excellence 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from with the impact of higher sg a expenses more than offset by the effect of higher net sales 
the year to year increase in sg a expenses is due to a number of factors  including higher sales commissions  incentive compensation and amortization expense 
in addition  fiscal included costs associated with the company s two fiscal acquisitions  and the transition to a direct sales model in japan for certain products previously sold under a distribution relationship 
other charges during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the relocation of its upland  california operations and certain workforce reductions

in  the company s results included a charge of million in connection with the closure of its chanhassen  mn plant 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of employees and million for estimated losses for asset impairment 
the company recorded pre tax benefits of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the reversal of previous accruals related to plant closures in and approximately million of the reversals was associated with the favorable settlement of future lease commitments on the castle rock facility  for which the company had recorded accruals in lower than expected impairment costs accounted for approximately million of the reversals 

table of contents as of august   million remained outstanding in connection with the aforementioned charges and are primarily related to severance payments of million  which run through may  and lease commitments of million  which run through july engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in as compared to million  or of net sales  in the company s er d activities continue to focus on the support of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
the company s er d expenses for the last half of the year included million related to the addition of employees hired in connection with the company s second quarter acquisition of asyst technologies  inc s wafer and reticle carrier product lines 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in compared to million in the decline reflects the significantly lower rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities compared to the year ago period as well as slightly lower invested balances 
other expense income  net other expense was million in fiscal compared to other income of million in fiscal other expense in included an impairment loss of million  or million after tax  related to the write down of the company s equity investment in metron technology nv common stock 
the company  a founding shareholder of metron  owned about million shares of metron common stock throughout prior to the impairment charge  the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a cost basis of million 
at november   the fair value of the investment was million  based on a price of per share  the closing price of metron at the end of the first quarter 
the decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary

the reversal of the valuation allowance was based on a partial realization of the net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal and the current belief that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated in the future to allow the remaining net operating losses to be utilized 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a one time benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the difference between the fiscal effective tax rate of and the us statutory rate of is primarily due to the one time benefits described above  lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities and a tax benefit associated with r d activities 
equity in net loss of affiliates the company s equity in the net loss of affiliates was million in and represents the company s share of losses in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting

in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded pre tax benefits of million  associated with adjustment of the aforementioned pretax charge related to the plant relocation 
our quarterly results of operations have been  and will likely continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  a number of which are beyond the company s control 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from operating activities  long term loans  lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short term lines of credit 
in fiscal  entegris raised capital via an initial public offering 
operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flow provided by operating activities in mainly reflected the company s net earnings  combined with various noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million 
such items were partly offset by the impact of working capital demands 
accounts receivable increased by million  reflecting the growth in sales in days sales outstanding decreased from days at the beginning of the year to days at the end of the year 
inventories increased by million over the fiscal year end balance 
the increase reflected the higher raw material  work in process and semi finished inventories required by the company s increased sales and production activity 

table of contents partly offsetting the working capital increases for receivables and inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities rose by million from august  and were mainly associated with the company s increased production activity and its improved sales and earnings 
in addition  accrued taxes rose by million  mainly reflecting the higher taxes owed resulting from the company s improved profitability 
working capital stood at million at august   including million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
investing activities cash flow used in investing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
acquisition of property and equipment totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in included investments in manufacturing  tooling  computer and laboratory equipment as well as a facility expansion in japan 
the company expects capital expenditures during fiscal to be about million  consisting mainly of spending on facility expansions  manufacturing equipment  tooling and information systems

in may  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of a precision parts cleaning business located in montpellier  france in a cash transaction for total consideration of million 
the transaction was made to expand the geographic reach of entegris materials integrity management off site cleaning services 
property and equipment and intangible assets  including goodwill  of approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded in connection with the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for by the purchase method 
accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements include the net assets and results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the company had purchases  net of maturities  of debt securities classified as short term investments of million during the company made purchases  net of maturities  of million and million of short term investments in and  respectively 
also  in fiscal  the company recorded proceeds of million in connection with its sale of  shares of metron common stock as described above under the caption other income and proceeds of million from the sale of various equipment 
on august   metron announced that it had entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement purchase agreement with applied materials  inc applied  pursuant to which applied would acquire the business assets of metron 
following the close of the proposed acquisition  metron expects to pay cash distributions to shareholders in the range of approximately to per share  to be made in at least two cash distributions during the six month period following the close of the transaction 
the acquisition is subject to regulatory and metron shareholder approval and other closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the calendar year 
if the transaction is consummated with cash distributions in the range indicated above  the company would receive gross proceeds of approximately million 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company made payments of million on borrowings and received proceeds from new borrowings totaling million in included in these amounts was the conversion of billion japanese yen  or approximately million  from short term borrowings to long term debt due in three to five years 
also included was the first quarter payment of the final million of the million originally borrowed in february when the company acquired the wafer and reticle carrier product line of asyst technologies  inc the company recorded proceeds of million  million and million in  and  respectively  in connection with common shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
as of august   the company s sources of available funds comprised million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and various credit facilities

borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit were approximately million at august  
table of contents under the unsecured revolving credit agreement  we are subject to  and are in compliance with  certain financial covenants including ratios requiring a fixed charge coverage of not less than to and a leverage ratio of not more than to 
in addition  we must maintain a calculated consolidated and domestic tangible net worth  which  as of august   are million and million  respectively  while also maintaining consolidated and domestic aggregate amounts of cash and short term investments of not less than million and million  respectively 
at august   the company s shareholders equity stood at million  up million from million at the beginning of the year 
the components of the increase included the company s net earnings  the proceeds and tax benefits associated with the issuance of shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans and increases in other comprehensive income totaling million 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes the maturities of the company s significant financial obligations in thousands long term debt operating leases fiscal year ending thereafter total on june   the company announced that it had filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission
