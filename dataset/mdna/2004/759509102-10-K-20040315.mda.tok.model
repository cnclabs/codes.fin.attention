ebitda is defined as the sum of income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  and amortization of intangibles including goodwill 
we believe that ebitda is commonly used as a measure of performance for companies in our industry and is frequently used by analysts  investors  lenders and other interested parties to evaluate a company s financial performance and its ability to incur and service debt while providing useful information 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statements of income and cash flows data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be construed as an indication of a company s operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda as measured in this annual report on form k is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for most of  the metals service center industry continued to experience low levels of customer demand  primarily related to the economic downturn in the united states 
demand for our products began to slow in the second half of  but only in certain geographic areas 
in early  we felt a sudden slowdown in demand for the semiconductor and related markets  and demand continued to decline throughout for all of our product end markets except aerospace 
aerospace demand and pricing were strong in  but fell off significantly after september th 
the low demand levels in all areas continued into  fell further in the second half of and continued into in september  customer demand improved somewhat across most products and end markets 
metals pricing for most of and all of remained at the historically low levels reached in  with the exception of carbon steel flat rolled products 
although end market demand was low  domestic carbon steel flat rolled costs increased significantly in the second half of due to supply constraints resulting from tariffs on imported material and domestic capacity shutdowns 
these costs remained high in early and then decreased 
however  late in the third quarter  carbon steel costs began to increase at very rapid rates 
these increases were due to high scrap and other raw material costs caused by the increased global demand for steel  especially in china  and due to increased energy costs at the producer level 
aluminum and stainless steel costs also increased in the second half of due to supply constraints and improved customer demand 
there were significant competitive pressures in the first half of that caused us to reduce our selling prices at a more rapid rate than our costs were declining  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
our performance was significantly impacted by these factors  however  we are proud of our consistently profitable returns and our ability to manage our working capital and to generate cash flow to expand and strengthen our business and reduce debt during this challenging environment 
we completed one acquisition during this acquisition contributed significantly to our financial results and allowed our performance to improve from our results 
this acquisition did require us to increase our leverage and to provide security under our credit agreements 
however  our strong cash flow in has allowed us to reduce our leverage more quickly than we had expected 
we believe that we are positioned to take full advantage of improved economic conditions  while at the same time we are poised to continue to operate efficiently in less favorable economies  such as that experienced during  because of our focus on cost controls and inventory turnover  and our product and geographic diversification 
in january and february  we experienced improvement in both demand and pricing for our products  and we have been able to pass most of our increased costs through to our customers  allowing us to increase our gross margins 
we anticipate that demand will remain strong through the first quarter of and that prices will continue to increase in the first half of supply of many of our products is expected to be tight for most of if we cannot pass our cost increases on to our customers  or if demand declines  this could pressure our gross margins in also  if we cannot obtain a sufficient supply of metals for our customers in  this could negatively impact our financial results 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
however  variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines we typically produce fewer revenue dollars  which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain expenses when volumes decline  however  we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increase 
we attempt to obtain the same gross profit percentage on our sales  so if prices increase and we are successful in maintaining the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate strong levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
recent developments we completed our largest acquisition to date in through this transaction  we entered into new geographic markets in indiana and kentucky  strengthened our presence in the midwest region of the united states and expanded our service offerings 
the acquisition made in of a metals processor did not result in a new segment 
on july  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of precision strip  inc and its related entity  precision strip transport  inc 
collectively precision strip for million in cash  plus the assumption of approximately million of debt 
precision strip is a privately held metals processing company founded in whose processing activities consist primarily of slitting and blanking carbon steel  stainless steel and aluminum flat rolled products on a toll basis  that is  processing the metal for a fee without taking ownership of the metal 
precision strip s revenues for the six months ended december  were million 
the business has facilities in minster  kenton  middletown and tipp city  ohio  anderson and rockport  indiana  bowling green  kentucky  and talladega  alabama 
precision strip s customers include carbon steel  stainless steel and aluminum mills  as well as companies in the automotive  appliance  metal furniture and capital goods industries 
on a volume basis  precision strip processes approximately billion of metal per year 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense operating profit excludes other income  amortization expense  equity in earnings of owned company  minority interest  interest expense and income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from the companies we acquired in and this includes a decrease in tons sold of and an increase in the average selling price per ton sold of the tons sold and average selling price per ton sold exclude amounts related to precision strip 
the decrease in our tons sold is mainly due to reduced customer demand in all markets through the first eight months of our sales volumes continued at the low levels experienced in the second half of until september when we began to experience some improvement in demand across most product and customer markets 
this improvement continued through the remainder of the increase in our average selling price per ton sold of resulted mainly from costs of carbon steel flat rolled products increasing significantly in the second half of due to supply constraints resulting from the temporary closure of a few mills and due to tariffs placed on imports 
these prices remained high in early and then declined somewhat until late in the third quarter of when carbon steel costs increased significantly due to a shortage of scrap and other raw materials and high energy costs for the producers 
the scrap shortage is a result of the increase in global steel demand  especially in china 
the costs for carbon steel continued to increase very rapidly in the fourth quarter of  and we increased our selling prices accordingly 
we also increased our prices for aluminum and stainless steel products due to reduced supply and improved customer demand that resulted in increased costs in the second half of our same store sales excludes sales of businesses we acquired in and increased million  or  with year tons sold declining as compared to  and the average selling price per ton sold increasing by 
these changes were due to the factors discussed above 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from mainly because of our increase in sales due to our and acquisitions and due to our increased selling prices 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decline in our gross margin percentage occurred primarily due to competitive pressures resulting from low levels of customer demand in the first half of when we reduced our selling prices at a more rapid rate than our material costs were declining 
this resulted in lower gross margin levels 
beginning in september  we experienced improved customer demand that allowed us to increase our selling prices and expand our gross margin levels 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or  from this increase includes the s  g a expenses of the company we acquired in plus a full year of expenses for our acquisitions 
we were able to reduce our same store s  g a expenses by million in as compared to these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the improvement as a percentage of sales resulted from our continued focus on expense reduction and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
depreciation expense increased million for compared to because of the inclusion of depreciation expense related to the companies we acquired in and operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  increased million  or  in compared to this occurred mainly due to the operating profit from our acquisition 
other income and expense 
interest expense increased by to million in compared to  due to increased borrowing levels to fund our acquisition of precision strip for million plus the assumption of approximately million of outstanding debt on july  because of our increased ownership interest in american steel  we began to consolidate their results beginning may  prior to that date  we accounted for our investment using the equity method 
on our income statement  the equity in earnings of owned company represents our of american steel s net income from january through april the minority interest amount represents of american steel s net income or loss beginning may  for the portion that we do not own 
minority interest also includes the net income or loss from the interest in valex korea co  ltd 
and the interest in valex corp 
that we do not own 
american steel incurred a loss in due to the continued depressed economic conditions in the northwest region of the united states  including the loss of certain large carbon steel customers in that area over the past few years 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  and due to the resolution of open tax issues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this includes an increase in tons sold of and a decrease in the average selling price per ton of 
the increase in our tons sold is mainly due to the sales from the companies we acquired in we continued to experience reduced customer demand in all markets during the decrease in our average selling price per ton sold of resulted mainly from shifts in product mix due to both acquisitions and reductions in our sales of higher priced products to the semiconductor  electronics and aerospace markets 
although metals costs had decreased significantly for most of our products during  we experienced further declines in with the exception of carbon steel flat rolled products 
in the second half of  costs of carbon steel flat rolled products increased significantly due to supply constraints resulting from the temporary closure of a few mills and due to tariffs placed on imports 
carbon steel flat rolled products represented approximately of our sales 
our same store sales excludes sales of businesses we acquired in and decreased million  or  with year tons sold declining as compared to  and the average selling price per ton decreasing by 
these decreases were due to the poor economic conditions in and shifts in our product mix with significant declines in same store sales to the semiconductor and aerospace industries impacting both the tons sold and the average selling price 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from due to our acquisitions 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decline in our gross margin percentage occurred primarily due to competitive pressures resulting from the low level of customer demand throughout the year  especially in the fourth quarter and due to lifo expense of million in compared to lifo income of million in lifo expense and income is reflected as part of our costs of sales 
although we were successful in passing through most of our cost increases  we did experience some margin pressure due to increased costs of carbon steel flat rolled products  coupled with the low demand in the latter part of the year 
the reduction in sales of our higher priced products to the aerospace and semiconductor markets also impacted our gross margins 
expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or  from this increase includes the s  g a expenses of the companies we acquired in plus a full year of expenses of our acquisitions 
these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
we were able to reduce our same store s  g a expenses by in as compared to the majority of the decrease in same store s  g a expenses relates to headcount reductions  as personnel costs are the most significant component of our variable costs 
for the year  we reduced our work force by  with half of the reductions  or approximately employees  occurring in the fourth quarter in response to declines in demand 
this reduction was in addition to the reduction that occurred in depreciation expense increased million for compared to  mainly because of the inclusion of depreciation expense related to the companies we acquired in and  along with depreciation expense on current year capital expenditures 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  decreased as a percentage of sales to in compared to in although consolidated sales increased  our gross profit margin declined and our operating expenses increased due to a larger network of service centers  as discussed above 
other income and expense 
interest expense decreased by to million in compared to  due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
we used the july equity offering proceeds of approximately million to pay down debt 
the year included borrowings for our acquisitions of central plains steel co 
and pacific metal company which were paid off with cash from operations and included million of debt upon consolidation of american steel 
amortization expense decreased million because of the change in accounting rules for goodwill 
in  we had million of goodwill amortization expense that was not recorded in  in accordance with the new rules 
the new accounting rules adopted in also require us to measure our goodwill annually for impairment of value 
we did not experience any goodwill impairment in  and therefore did not record any impairment charges 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  resulting from both acquisitions and current economic conditions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital was million  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our inventory levels of million  an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in our current debt maturities of million 
the additional working capital from our acquisition was million on july  to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
at december   our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days  consistent with our rate at december  we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turnover rate was about times in  improved from about times in the increase in accounts payable of million was due to managing our payments to vendors to maximize our cash flow  combined with increased costs for the metals we purchased late in as demand and pricing for our products improves  our working capital needs will increase 
we expect to finance this with increased borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from our internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
our operations provided cash of million in compared to million in along with our earnings  the reductions in our inventory levels and increases in our accounts payable were the primary factors in providing cash flow from operations 
the cash generated from operations in was used to fund our capital expenditures and to pay down debt  including debt used to fund the purchase of precision strip and to pay off the american steel credit facility 
on january  date of maturity  we paid off million of private placement notes with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
on july   we borrowed million to fund the acquisition of precision strip  with million borrowed on our syndicated credit facility and with million of proceeds from issuing new senior secured notes in a private placement 
excluding the million borrowed to fund the acquisition  we made net repayments on our credit facility of million during at december  our net debt to total capital ratio was compared to at december  our syndicated credit facility allows for million in borrowings 
as of december   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
the million five year secured syndicated credit facility  as amended effective july   is with ten banks and may be increased to million 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our syndicated credit facility 
american steel had a syndicated credit agreement with a borrowing limit of million 
this credit facility was paid off and cancelled in november we borrowed million under the reliance syndicated credit facility to fund the american steel pay off 
at december   we had agreements with insurance companies for private placements of senior secured notes in the aggregate amount of million  including the new notes issued on july  those outstanding senior notes have maturity dates ranging from to  and bear interest at an average rate of per annum 
the syndicated credit facility and senior note agreements were amended effective july  to provide  among other things  for the company to grant a security interest in certain personal property to the lenders named therein 
the security interest will terminate when we meet certain conditions  including a required leverage ratio 
the syndicated credit facility and senior note agreements  as amended  also require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio  and include restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
our net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures or capital leases as of december  our capital expenditures are budgeted at million 
historically  our actual capital expenditures have been less than our budgeted amount 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to make an additional payment of approximately million to the precision strip sellers in the first quarter of to reimburse them for the tax differential related to our election of section h treatment  per the terms of the acquisition agreement 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate acquiring additional companies until we have further reduced our leverage ratio  which is expected to be by the end of the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
payments due by year in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total amounts include principal payments only 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding interest rates and payment dates 
includes capital expenditure items committed to as of december   including a lease buy out option at fair market value 
the fair market value has been estimated at million based upon market comparisons 
includes non cancelable purchase or service contracts with a term of one year or greater that existed at december  the majority of our material purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table 
also includes the amount of the put option to purchase the remaining interest in american steel  llc  per the terms of the operating agreement 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next five years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
information was not available for all plans or for all years 
on august   our board of directors approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of our outstanding common stock through our stock repurchase plan  for a total of  shares 
since inception of the stock repurchase plan  we have purchased a total of  shares of our common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products and holiday closures of some of our customers 
in  many customers extended their holiday closures which we believe was due to both the poor business conditions and the holidays occurring mid week 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed impairment tests of goodwill as of january   november  and november   and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  deferred tax assets  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with the audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on our past collection history and the identification of specific potential customer risks 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information concerning our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and have performed impairment testing in accordance with the statement 
we estimated future cash flows at the reporting unit level 
a key assumption made is that our business will grow at to per year  adjusted for the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and have reviewed recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
additionally  we are exposed to market risk primarily related to our fixed rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
decreases in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on our debt  we do not consider the exposure to interest rate risk to be material 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not callable until maturity
