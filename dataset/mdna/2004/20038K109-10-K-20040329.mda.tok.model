item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

table of contents overview staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employee related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  k  disability and life insurance to its eligible billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company grows  these receivables will increase and there will be greater requirements for borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund current operations 
the company reports its results through three operating segments human capital management services  staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services 
the human capital management services segment provides consulting services for managing the contingent workforce 
the staff augmentation segment provides healthcare support  technical  information technology it  telecom and other staffing services 
the financial outsourcing services segment provides payroll  funding and outsourcing support services to independent consulting and staffing companies 
management of the company has observed improvement in the business environment for staffing companies beginning in the fourth quarter of recent industry statistics generally support management s observations subject to concerns as to the rate of job creation in the united states 
the company has sought to position itself competitively in what it expects to be an improving marketplace 
in addition to taking steps to improve operational efficiencies  management has sought to improve the company s balance sheet 
including repurchases effected in the first quarter of  since june  the company has reduced its public debt from million to million 
as a result  it has reduced its annual interest expense by approximately million  including by borrowing at the lower rates available under the pnc credit facility to effectuate repurchases and by exchanging preferred equity and lower interest rate convertible notes for this public debt 
recent developments in the first quarter of  the company sold certain of its niche telecom operations and repurchased million of it senior notes 
see recent developments in item replacement of credit facility in june  comforce  coi and various of their operating subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit and security agreement the pnc credit facility with pnc bank  national association  as a lender and administrative agent pnc and other financial institutions participating as lenders to provide for a million revolving credit facility with available borrowings based  generally  on of the company s accounts receivable aged days or less  subject to specified limitations and exceptions 
at closing  the company borrowed million and repaid the company s then existing revolving credit facility agented by whitehall business credit corporation the whitehall credit facility  which was thereupon terminated 
the whitehall credit facility  which the company entered into in december  as subsequently amended  provided for borrowings of up to million 
the company incurred a write off of deferred financing costs of  in the second quarter of related to the early retirement of the whitehall credit facility 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a per annum rate equal to either the greater of the base commercial lending rate of pnc as announced from time to time or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus a margin ranging from if the company s fixed charged coverage ratio is greater than to if this ratio is with the initial fixed and first calculated margins having been from funding in june through the end of fiscal 
the obligations evidenced by the pnc credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of certain key operating subsidiaries of the company and by security interests in substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreements evidencing the pnc credit facility contain various financial and other covenants and conditions  including  but not limited to  limitations on paying dividends  engaging in affiliate transactions  making acquisitions and incurring additional indebtedness 
the scheduled maturity date of the pnc credit facility is june  the pnc credit facility affords the company greater borrowing flexibility and has a maturity date close to three years beyond the maturity date of the whitehall credit facility 

table of contents as of december   the company had remaining availability based upon then outstanding eligible accounts receivable of million  which provides for borrowings of up to million based  generally  on of the company s accounts receivable aged days or less  subject to specified limitations and exceptions 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the pnc credit facility at the end of fiscal and expects to remain in compliance throughout fiscal in the event that the company is unable to meet any of such covenants  it will request a modification or waiver of such covenants 
if the company s revenues in fiscal exceed current projections  management intends to ask its bank lenders to increase the availability under the pnc credit facility to fund potentially higher levels of receivables 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on the trade receivables with consideration for the company s historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables  general economic climate and the financial condition of the customer 
after giving due consideration to these factors  the company establishes specific allowances for bad debt 
the allowance for the funding and service fee receivable is calculated with consideration for the ability of the company s clients to absorb chargebacks due to the uncollectibility of the funded receivables 
bad debt expense  which increases the allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by customers  the inability of the company s funding services clients to absorb chargebacks and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 
reserves for workers compensation the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and reserves for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its reserves  the company includes reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the amounts reserved by the company for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely 

table of contents management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
the net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or management s estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that management s estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
the company provides for income taxes on a quarterly basis based upon an estimated annual tax rate 
in determining this rate  management estimates taxable income for each of the states where the company operates  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each state 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  the estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
goodwill impairment the company is required to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas as of the end of each fiscal year or earlier during each fiscal year as circumstances require 
the company tested for goodwill impairment as of the end of each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as a result of the testing in the third quarter of  the company wrote off million of goodwill in the staff augmentation segment 
the company also performed its annual testing for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no additional write offs were required to be taken 
in connection with these goodwill tests  the company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in the determination of the fair values of its reporting units as defined by sfas 
in its determination of the fair values  the firm engaged by the company primarily utilized a discounted cash flow analysis as well as various other valuation approaches  including a recent values paid by investors and purchasers of companies in businesses similar to that of the company  b capitalization multiples of companies with investment characteristics resembling those of the reporting units  c the enterprise value of the company  and d asset and liability structure 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and operating unit profit margins are based on management s expectation of future results 
based on management s assessment of the circumstances and considering the firm s findings  the company recognized an impairment loss of million due to the company s inability to meet previous growth expectations 
these impairment losses relate primarily to the goodwill attributable to staffing companies acquired by the company in through  during which time staffing companies were customarily valued using higher multiples  and these companies had significantly higher earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

operating loss for the fiscal year december  was million as compared to operating loss of million for the fiscal year december  the increase in operating loss for the fiscal year december  is principally attributable to the company s third quarter million non cash write off related to the impairment of goodwill discussed above and a decrease in gross margins in staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services segments  partially offset by the million insurance claim recovery discussed above 
by comparison  in  the company wrote off million related to goodwill impairment  exclusive of the write off of million earlier in that was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

these costs were further reduced by lower commissions as a result of the decrease of sales discussed above 
operating loss for the fiscal year december  was million as compared to operating income of million for the fiscal year december  this operating loss for the fiscal year december  is principally attributable to the company s fourth quarter million write off related to the impairment of goodwill discussed above and a decrease in sales and gross margins in staff augmentation and financial outsourcing services segments  partially offset by a reduction of million in goodwill amortization due to the adoption of sfas as well as the more favorable workers compensation history for fiscal discussed above

in may  principally in order to eliminate the costs associated with the administration of the pik debentures  the company redeemed the remaining  of pik debentures in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
senior notes in june  the company repurchased million principal amount of senior notes for  resulting in a gain on debt extinguishment of  which includes the reduction of approximately  of deferred financing costs

convertible notes in september  the company issued shares of its series b preferred stock having an aggregate face amount and fair market value of  in exchange for million principal amount of convertible notes  plus accrued interest  in a transaction with a related party the fanning partnership 
the consideration paid to the related party in september for the principal amount of the convertible notes exchanged in this transaction was substantially less than the consideration paid by it for the securities it had previously exchanged for the convertible notes 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a contribution to capital of  net of taxes  in lieu of recognizing a gain on the extinguishment of debt 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income that had been generated by the company was attributable to the operations of coi 
except for permitted distributions  these assets and any cumulated net income are restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture governing the senior notes imposes restrictions on coi making specified payments  which are referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
under the indenture  coi is not permitted to make cash distributions to comforce other than to upstream million annually to pay public company expenses  to upstream up to million to pay income tax related to deemed forgiveness of pik debentures to facilitate the purchase or exchange by comforce of pik debentures at less than par  under certain circumstances in connection with a disposition of assets  to upstream proceeds therefrom to repay the pik debentures  and to upstream funds to the extent coi meets the restricted payments test under the indenture  the most significant component of which is based upon a percentage of net income generated by coi since january  on a cumulative basis  less prior distributions made in reliance on this provision 
management believes that million annually if coi has funds available for this purpose will be sufficient to pay comforce s annual public company expenses for the foreseeable future 
principally as a result of losses incurred by coi in fiscal  and and prior distributions made by coi to comforce  coi can make no distributions to comforce based upon the cumulative net income provisions of the indenture 
it is anticipated that coi must generate net income of approximately million before it will be able to upstream any funds to comforce under the restrictive payments test of the indenture in order to pay cash interest on the convertible notes which is required beginning on june  or to repay the convertible notes at their maturity on december  in calculating net income for this purpose  under the terms of the indenture  the company must apply generally accepted accounting principles as in effect at the time the indenture was entered into in 
table of contents through december   interest on the convertible notes is payable  at the option of comforce  in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional convertible notes 
comforce has paid all interest under the convertible notes in kind though december  beginning with the interest payment due june   comforce will be required to pay interest on the convertible notes in cash 
its ability to do so is expected to be dependent on its availability of funds for this purpose  whether through borrowings by coi under the pnc credit facility  funds from coi s operations or otherwise  and on coi s ability to upstream funds in accordance with the restricted payments test under the indenture for the senior notes 
comforce s ability to repay convertible notes at their maturity on december   or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase dates  will also be dependent on any restrictions under its loan agreements as then in effect and availability of funds 
in march  the holder of the convertible notes  which is a partnership in which john fanning  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  holds the principal economic interest  agreed to extend the payment in kind terms under the convertible notes from the original termination date on december  for one additional year 
the company s board has directed management  in consultation with an independent financial advisor  to advise the board as to appropriate consideration to pay to the holder for agreeing to this accommodation 
this consideration will be recorded in fiscal as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions 
the company evaluated the recoverability of goodwill on its books under the new standards under sfas i at its adoption in the first quarter of  resulting in its write off of million of goodwill  ii in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an additional write off of million of goodwill  iii in the third quarter of as described above in this item under goodwill impairment  resulting in an additional write off of million  and iv in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in no additional impairment charges 
the company must test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas at least annually as of the end of each fiscal year or earlier during each fiscal year as circumstances require 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the pnc credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements throughout the company has made significant progress in improving its capital structure  most recently through the elimination of debt in connection with its repurchase of pik debentures formerly public debt  now fully retired  senior notes which continue to be public debt and convertible notes during fiscal  as described above  but no assurance can be given that opportunities to further eliminate high interest rate debt will be available on favorable terms 
including repurchases effected in the first quarter of  since june  the company has reduced its public debt from million to million 
as a result  comforce has reduced its annual interest expense by approximately million  including by borrowing at the lower rates available under the pnc credit facility to effectuate repurchases and by exchanging preferred equity and lower interest rate convertible notes for this public debt 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the pnc credit facility at the end of fiscal and expects to remain in compliance throughout fiscal in the event that the company is unable to meet any of such covenants  it will request a modification or waiver of such covenants 
if the company s revenues in fiscal exceed current projections  management intends to ask its bank lenders to increase the availability under the pnc credit facility to fund potentially higher levels of receivables 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this accounting standard establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that certain financial instruments that were previously classified as equity now be classified as a liability 
this accounting standard is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for technical and engineering services  it and telecom staffing services has historically been lower during the second half of the fourth quarter through the following first quarter  and  generally  shows gradual improvement until the second half of the fourth quarter 
forward looking statements various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to the following weakness in job growth or renewed economic malaise generally or in key industries served by the company  such as aircraft manufacturing and information technology  a reduction in government spending in key sectors served by the company  or a reduction in the demand for outsourcing services generally which could heighten competition among staffing companies and negatively impact revenues and margins  the company s significant leverage may leave it with a diminished ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other capital expenditures  for retiring higher interest rate debt or for otherwise improving the company s competitiveness and capital structure or expanding its operations  sfas  which requires the company to evaluate at least annually the recoverability of goodwill on its books  could cause the company to write off goodwill in future periods in addition to the write offs of million in and million in  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations  or  if coi fails to generate sufficient consolidated net income after covering its cumulative deficit at december  of million or to have any other funds available to upstream to comforce under the restricted payments test of the senior notes indenture in order for it to pay cash interest on the convertible notes which is required beginning on june  or to repay the convertible notes at their maturity on december   or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase date  then  unless comforce obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds for this purpose  the company will default under the indenture governing the senior notes and under the pnc credit facility  or under any replacement facilities  debt instruments or indentures 
additional important factors that could cause the company to be unable to realize its plans and objectives are described under risk factors in the registration statement on form s of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on april  registration no 

the disclosure under risk factors in the registration statement may be accessed through the web site maintained by the securities and exchange commission at www

in addition  the company will provide  without charge  a copy of such risk factors disclosure to each stockholder of the company who requests such information 
requests for copies should be directed to the attention of linda annicelli  vice president  administration at comforce corporation  crossways park drive  po box  woodbury  new york  telephone item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations  including million principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum  million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the estimated fair value of these debt obligations at december  was million for the senior notes  and million for the convertible notes 
management of the company does not believe that a increase in interest rates would have a material impact to the fair value of these fixed rate obligations 
borrowings under the pnc credit facility aggregating million at december  are at variable interest rates and interest expense will be impacted by changes in interest rates generally prevailing in the united states and internationally 
assuming an immediate increase in the weighted average interest rate of  the impact to the company in annualized interest payable would be approximately  accordingly  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate fluctuations
