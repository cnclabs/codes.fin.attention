item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes a number of forward looking statements and  with respect to this section  the cautionary language applicable to such forward looking statements described above in a caution about forward looking statements found before item of this form k is incorporated by reference into this item basically  forward looking statements are management s best estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates 
overview we are a leading provider of software development and deployment solutions designed to improve software quality  accelerate the delivery of software  lower the cost of ownership and reduce the risk of errors by helping customers manage software development projects from beginning to end 
we believe a full understanding of our operating results for the year ended december  requires an understanding both of the elements that drove our company performance and of the macro economic conditions that affect our business 
first  total revenues increased primarily as a result of two substantial acquisitions in january second  the market for software development tools that has been our historical revenue base continues to mature  particularly java development tools 
this maturation has put pressure on the pricing of products that constitute much of our historical revenue base  and as a consequence  pressure on our financial results for finally  as a result of poor sales execution in  we failed to generate the revenues necessary to support the cost structure in place at the time 
as a result  we carried excess costs throughout  which harmed our financial performance throughout the year 
in addition to these company specific factors  we believe our operating results were further affected by the continuing weakness in the software development and deployment solutions market in which we operate  with our potential customers showing a general cautiousness in capital spending on software 
in response to these conditions  particularly the maturation of our traditional market  we have recently begun transforming the company from one focused on selling individual development tools to one focused on selling multi product enterprise solutions that span the application development lifecycle 
as part of this transformation  in we acquired two companies that provide us with the requirements management  modeling and software configuration management capabilities needed to fill out our suite of application development solutions 
we realigned our management and sales organization to support the strategic direction of the company 
we restructured many of our operations and conducted reductions in force in an effort to improve organizational efficiencies  control our expense structure  increase sales productivity and drive to a more profitable long term financial model 
finally  we are in the process of upgrading our marketing and selling efforts to address enterprise opportunities 
we expect to continue all of these activities over the next several quarters  and doing so may put pressure on our financial results and operations as we go through this transformation 
in  we will continue to focus on increasing sales force productivity by generating more sales of our multi product solutions to enterprise customers 
as we do so  we expect to compete more directly with larger companies and expect to experience longer sales cycles which is typical for sales of larger solutions 
in addition  in  we will seek to contain departmental spending to levels more consistent with those of other software companies 
we achieved the following financial results during the year ended december for the year ended december   our consolidated net revenues grew to million  from million for the year ended december   million of which were generated by products acquired from starbase and togethersoft and services related to those products 

table of contents licenses and other revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   of which million and million relate to the amortization of other intangible assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is primarily attributable to cash expended in connection with the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft 
we repurchased  shares of our stock under our stock repurchase programs for a total cost of million during the year ended december  this brings the total purchased under our stock repurchase programs to  shares for a cost of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and the application of gaap requires us to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by us 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies  which are discussed further below 
in addition to these estimates and assumptions that are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements  the inability to properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenues could significantly affect our future operations 
we must make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue 
specifically  our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of such transaction 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time  which is subject to change 
specifically  the slowdown in the global economy and information technology spending has caused and may continue to cause 
table of contents customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner  and thereby the delays may adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include assistance in implementation and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
we recognize license fees on contracts that do not involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products upon delivery when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we determine the value for services and post contract customer support based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop  and related accounting literature 
vsoe for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for services  given the complexity of the services and experience of the professional performing the services  or the amount charged on similar transactions 
vsoe for annual post contract customer support is established with the stated future renewal rates included in the contracts or the amount charged on a similar transaction 
we recognize revenues for the license portion of a multiple element arrangement based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not generally request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable or there are extended payment terms  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we recognize revenue for software licensed for a specific time period  or term license  ratably over the term of the license 
increasingly  we are selling more comprehensive enterprise software solutions 
these solutions often involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products 
we recognize license and service revenues associated with contracts involving significant implementation or integration  either on a percentage of completion basis or a completed contract basis depending on whether or not we can obtain reliable estimates of the costs to complete the work 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and or service revenues  based upon the estimated fair value of each element based upon vsoe 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenues upon shipment to our distributors 
due to the level of historic returns and willingness to accept returns from our major distributors  we maintain allowances for product returns from our distributors to cover their unsold reported inventory 
additionally  we maintain allowances for product returns from our channel resellers and end users based upon historical return rates  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
we make complex accounting decisions in our percentage of completion accounting  involving judgements and estimates as to future costs and recoverability of unbilled amounts 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing our sales returns and other allowances with our channel resellers 
the provision for sales returns and rebates amounted to million in  as compared to million in and million in  reflecting a greater emphasis on direct sales to end users in we offer return rights to end users only in limited circumstances 
if future returns increase over historical levels  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents other service revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as such services are performed 
service revenues from post contract customer support are recognized ratably over the support period  generally one year 
accounting for acquisitions on january   we completed the acquisition of privately held togethersoft for approximately million in cash   shares of borland common stock and the assumption of togethersoft s stock option plans 
approximately million of the total consideration is being held in escrow to indemnify us against and reimburse us for certain events and cover certain liabilities and transaction costs 
unused funds will be released from escrow at certain times between and pursuant to a merger agreement  by and between borland  starbase and galaxy acquisition corp  on october   we commenced an all cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of starbase for aggregate consideration of approximately million and million in bridge financing that was forgiven upon the consummation of the transaction 
in the initial tender offer  which expired on november   we purchased approximately of the outstanding starbase shares for approximately million 
upon the completion of the initial tender  we began consolidating the operating results of starbase 
on january  we purchased the remaining shares outstanding for approximately million 
during  we also completed the acquisitions of boldsoft  vmgear and highlander 
we accounted for these acquisitions as purchases in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  we have reported all the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired companies at fair value 
our determination of the values of our acquired intangibles was based on the discounted cash flow method 
we recognize the fair value of the purchased identifiable intangibles as an operating expense over the estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible  unless the identifiable intangible is determined to have an indefinite life 
we recognize the fair value associated with in process technology as an operating expense during the period the transaction is consummated 
we value employee stock options assumed as part of the acquisition using the black scholes valuation model 
the value of all vested awards and the value of unvested awards in excess of the intrinsic value of the unvested awards are included as part of the purchase consideration 
we report the intrinsic value of the unvested awards as deferred compensation and record it as an operating expense over the remaining vesting period of the award 
we value our stock issued as part of the purchase consideration based upon the average of the closing price for the five day trading period surrounding the transaction 
we report total consideration in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets  net of assumed liabilities  as goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas  we evaluate the goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  then we move to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed our evaluation of the goodwill during the quarter ended september  and determined that we had a single reporting unit and that there was no impairment 
the market capitalization method was the primary method used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the premium for control  which was assumed to be  were determined using our best estimates as of the impairment review 
we did not record a loss on impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 

table of contents we may incur substantial liabilities connected to the termination of employees  asserted claims or litigation  impairment of assets or termination of leases in connection with our acquisitions that are accounted for as purchases 
we have incurred such liabilities with the acquisition of starbase in the year ended december  and togethersoft in the year ending december  we estimate merger related costs at the time of the acquisition and accrue these costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  or eitf  with an offsetting entry to goodwill 
these accruals involve estimates regarding future events  sometimes several years in the future 
we may make revisions and adjustments to the accrual and the related goodwill based on actual events 
restructuring we report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  and sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required beyond a minimum day retention period from the employee to earn the termination benefits 
we recognize facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and other exit costs when we have future payment with no future economic benefit or a commitment to pay the termination costs of a prior commitment 
these termination and other exit costs are reported at fair value 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted 
we recognize compensation cost for stock options  if any  ratably over the vesting period 
generally  we grant options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
we granted restricted stock to certain employees and officers during the year ended december  compensation expense for restricted stock issued was not material in the year ended december  we provide additional pro forma disclosures as required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas 
table of contents pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share had we recorded compensation costs based on the estimated grant date fair value  as defined by sfas  for awards granted under our stock option and stock purchase plans  our pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share for the years ended december   and would have been as follows amounts in thousands  expect per share data year ended december  net income loss as reported stock compensation adjustment intrinsic value stock compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income loss per share as reported basic as reported diluted pro forma basic pro forma diluted the pro forma amounts include compensation expenses related to stock option grants and stock purchase rights for the years ended december   and in future years  the annual compensation expense will increase relative to the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted in those future years 
we account for stock options issued to non employees  excluding non employee directors  under sfas and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments with variable terms that are issued for consideration other than employee services under sfas  or eitf we record the expense of such services based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the black scholes pricing model 
assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity instruments issued to employees 
we charge the value of the equity instrument to earnings over the term of the service agreement 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we evaluate the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
no impairment was recorded during  or in accordance with sfas  we account for property held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less selling costs  based on an independent appraisal 
at december   we classified an office building we own and lease to a third party with a book value of million as property held for sale  as we were actively seeking a purchaser for the property 
at december   this asset was classified as a depreciable asset as we were unsuccessful at selling the property 
when the property was put back into service  it was at its prior cost basis  reduced for depreciation expense that would have been recorded during the period the asset was removed from service  as required by sfas 
table of contents investments from time to time we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the current carrying value of an investment  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down our investment in trolltech as and million to write down our loan to appforge  which was subsequently recovered and recorded as a gain on investments in the year ended december  at december   we do not hold a minority interest in any company 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the weight of the available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax asset 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and its related valuation allowance 
if our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change  we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we make the determination 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
contingencies our current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
as of december   we have accrued approximately million for professional service fees and other settlement costs 
from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights  disputing royalties  or disputing other commercial 
table of contents arrangements 
regardless of the merit of any such claim  responding to these claims could be time consuming and expensive  and may require us to enter into licensing or royalty agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we expect that our software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment increases  the functionality of product overlap and industry participants become more aggressive in using patents offensively 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our total net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses  which are included as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative comprehensive income loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations is also considered 
cumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of any subsidiary is the local currency 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations in the period during which the disposal occurs 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly we had cumulative translation gains of approximately million and million  which were included as part of cumulative comprehensive income within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  translation adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  were included under cumulative comprehensive income loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these gains and losses would have been included in our results of operations for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  singapore dollar  hong kong dollar  chinese yen  korean won  brazilian real  russian ruble  indian rupee  mexican peso and australian  new zealand and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
hedging activities are discussed under foreign currency risk in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

table of contents licenses and other revenues the following table presents our licenses and other revenues for the years ended december   and  and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year in thousands  except percentages 
change change licenses and other revenues as percent of total net revenues in  we began aligning our presentation of licenses and other revenues to better reflect our application lifecycle management  or alm  strategy 
specifically  we have three major product categories design  develop and deploy 
design includes the products from our recent acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase starteam  caliberrm  together and other related design and management products 
develop includes two major categories java  which includes jbuilder  java studio and optimizeit  and 
net  which includes delphi  c builder  c builder  kylix and c mobile edition 
deploy is comprised of our borland enterprise server products  interbase  janeva and other enterprise products 
compared to our reporting for the year ended december   design is a new category  develop encompasses our former java and rad product lines  and deploy encompasses the products that we previously described as the enterprise product group 
we have sought to provide comparability between historic product groups  while updating our nomenclature to reflect new platforms and our alm strategy 
licenses and other revenues represent amounts for license fees and royalties earned for granting customers the right to use our software products 
licenses and other revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and represented  and of net revenues for the years then ended  respectively 
the following table presents our licenses and other revenues by product category and its percentage of total licenses and other revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages design develop deploy net licenses and other revenues design 
there were no licenses and other revenues from our design product group for the year ended december  we completed the acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase and began consolidating their results in january and december  respectively 
in the future  we expect the license revenues from the design product group to represent a larger percentage of our total license revenues as these products will represent more significant components within our alm solution 
develop 
licenses and other revenues from our java product lines represented million  million and million of licenses and other revenues from our develop product group for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in licenses and other revenues in our java product lines during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was due to lower revenues from our jbuilder product line partially offset by growth in our optimizeit product line 
we believe the market growth in adoption of new java development technology has slowed  and consequently our sales of jbuilder have 
table of contents slowed 
additionally  as more of our java customers have purchased maintenance contracts that provide them with upgrades  we believe we will generate less revenue from product upgrades 
we believe that revenue growth from our jbuilder product will be dependent upon the expansion of the java development market and the success of our alm solutions in the java market 
the increase in licenses and other revenues in our java product lines during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was primarily due to growth in the java market and  to a lesser extent  to the introduction of optimizeit into our product offerings 
licenses and other revenues from our 
net product lines represented million  million and million of licenses and other revenues from our develop product group for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in licenses and other revenues from our 
net product lines during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the lack of a major product version release earlier in the year 
delphi was released in the last half of the fourth quarter of  as compared to  which included the releases of delphi in the third quarter of and c builder in the first quarter of the growth in our 
net product lines will be dependent upon the rate of adoption of the 
net framework and our ability to provide compelling development solutions that compete with  complement or enhance offerings from microsoft 
also  we expect to benefit from offering design and deployment solutions that complement the microsoft s existing development solutions  as we do not compete directly against microsoft in these areas 
the decrease in licenses and other revenues from our 
net product lines during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was primarily due to the general economic conditions  the maturation of our products and the timing of new product releases as mentioned above for c builder and delphi deploy 
the decrease in licenses and other revenues from our deploy product group for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was due to lower revenues generated from our visibroker and application server products 
the decrease in licenses and other revenues from our deploy product group for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was due to lower revenues generated from our visibroker server product 
we believe that these reductions in licenses and other revenues from our deploy products were a result of recessionary economic conditions  especially in the telecommunications and financial sectors  and geopolitical uncertainty 
revenue growth from our deploy products category will depend upon the recovery in corporate spending for deployment solutions  our ability to capture a greater portion of government spending on technology  our ability to provide compelling technical solutions for software deployment to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and our ability to integrate our deploy products with our design and develop products 
service revenues the following table presents our service revenues for the years ended december   and  and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year in thousands  except percentages 
change change service revenues as percent of total net revenues service revenues represent amounts earned for technical support  consulting and training services for software products 
the increase in service revenues in the year ended december  from the year ended december  was primarily a result of an increase in technical support revenues and  to a lesser extent  an increase in consulting revenues 

table of contents the following table presents our services and other revenues by service category and its percentage of total services and other revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages technical support consulting and training services and other revenues the year to year growth in technical support revenues from to was due to the acquisitions of togethersoft and starbase  and a larger percentage of our customers purchasing support contracts 
historically  a greater percentage of togethersoft and starbase revenues were from larger enterprises  therefore a greater percentage of their customers purchased support contracts 
with the acquisitions completed in  our support revenues benefited from the fair value of support contracts assumed in the acquisitions and the annual renewals of those contracts 
the growth in technical support revenues in from was due to increased sales of our enterprise level support offerings  principally due to the increased demand for our java products in when compared to the increase in consulting revenues for the year ended december   when compared with the same period in the prior year  was due to an increased emphasis on products with a greater process focus our design products and approximately million in consulting revenue recognized from large development projects with three technology partners 
the increase in consulting revenues for the year ended december   when compared with the same period in  was due to the timing of the completion of certain consulting engagements 
over the longer term  we expect growth  if any  in our support revenues and our consulting and training revenues to depend on our success in selling our solutions into larger enterprises with greater frequency 
our service revenues may also grow as our new enterprise solution offerings increase in complexity and include more services as a component of larger sales contracts 
however  not all of the resultant incremental service revenue will accrue to us directly  depending on our success in partnering with systems integrators 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding or finding new engagements we may experience decreases in our consulting revenue as we complete large consulting engagements 
international net revenues revenues from sources outside the united states  or non us revenues  represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of non us revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the years ended december  and  was principally due to the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft  which had greater percentages of their revenues from the us in  we expect us revenues to continue to represent more than of total net revenues

the reduction in the cost of licenses and other revenues when comparing the years ended december  and was principally attributable to a reduction in direct production costs and inventory costs  as we had a larger percentage of our licenses and other revenues generated from large corporate contracts 
typically  large enterprise and corporate licenses are delivered electronically or represent additional licenses of software that have already been delivered 
this has the impact of reducing our production costs and inventory costs

our december restructuring accrual included million resulting from headcount reductions of employees  including in sales and general and administrative and in research and development  and million resulting from the termination of certain facilities leases 
this amount represents our remaining lease payments less anticipated sublease income and is recorded in current liabilities

our march restructuring accrual included million resulting from headcount reductions of employees  including in sales and general and administrative and in research and development  and million resulting from the termination of certain facilities leases 
in addition  we recorded an additional charge of million for a change in estimated lease termination costs related to two facilities in the united kingdom 
in january we settled our obligation on one of the two facilities and are actively working to settle the other 
due to the timing of payments under the lease agreements  we recorded these costs as a part of long term restructuring 
the restructuring charges relating to operating leases have been recorded  net of assumed sublease income and present value factors 
we believe that our restructuring activities will reduce our expense levels  resulting in a cost structure that is better aligned with anticipated revenues 
specifically  we expect the restructuring activities  along with their cost control initiatives  will reduce our quarterly operating expenses by up to approximately million from where operating expenses would have been absent the restructuring activities 
the total restructuring charges and related cash outlays are based on our current estimates  which may change materially if significant fluctuations in foreign currencies occur  if further consolidations are required or

we will review the status of our restructuring activities quarterly and  if appropriate  record changes in estimates related to our restructuring obligations in current operations

other income also decreased due to a decrease in rental income from our property on green hills road  scotts valley  california of million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  these declines were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency gains and losses 
there was a foreign currency gain of million and a foreign currency loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the currency gain recorded for the year ended december  was primarily due to the united states dollar s weakening against the japanese yen  brazilian real  the australian dollar and the euro

income taxes on a consolidated basis  we generated a pre tax loss of approximately million for the year ended december   and a pre tax profit of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which equaled  and of our pre tax profit loss  respectively 
the change in income tax provision as a percentage of pre tax profit in from was principally related to a greater amount of our non us pretax profits being subject to tax  and to a taxable loss in the us the change in income tax provision as a percentage of pre tax profit in from was principally related to a greater amount of our non us pretax profits being subject to tax  and to a reduction in the utilization of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
our effective tax rate is primarily dependent on the location of taxable profits  if any  due to our nol carryforwards in certain  but not all  jurisdictions  and the imposition of withholding taxes on revenues regardless of our profitability 
we currently expect that our effective tax rate will approximately range between and in  but our actual rate will be highly dependent on jurisdictional mix 
our income tax provision for the year ended december  differs from the statutory tax rate principally due to our inability to benefit from our nols in the us  and due to income taxes in certain us jurisdictions and withholding taxes on certain payments we receive from non us persons that are imposed regardless of our profitability 
for us federal and state income tax purposes  we have nol carryforwards of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
the amount of nol carryforwards has increased significantly from december  as we have succeeded to the us federal nol carryforwards of togethersoft and starbase in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in the event that we can utilize these nol carryforwards against our us federal taxable income  we will release a portion of the valuation allowance against goodwill 
we also have available us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these credit carryforwards expire between and  if not utilized 
we also have alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of federal and state nol and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
we also have approximately million of nol carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions 
deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances of approximately million relate to certain us nol carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision 
at december  and  we had reserved a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets 
we believe sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets  caused by the impact on our net operating losses of factors including our acquisition strategy  continued competition in all the markets in which we participate  the possibility of future industry consolidation and the uncertainty of predicting our future income  such that a valuation allowance has been provided

net cash paid for severance and facilities costs associated with restructuring was approximately million in in relation to our restructuring activities during the year ended december   we expect to make restructuring related payments during our fiscal quarter ended march  of approximately million in severance related payments and approximately million in facility related payments 
we are actively negotiating the termination of some of our lease commitments 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be affected by the terms of accounts payable arrangements 
we anticipate our operating expenses to remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future and as a result we intend to fund our operating expenses through cash flows from operations

net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  was million 
for the year ended december   we had net sales of short term investments of approximately million partially offset by acquisitions of million in property and equipment 
we expect that during the year ended december  our cash used in acquisition related activities will be significantly less than during the year ended december  however  if needed  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or products lines 
we expect significant activity in purchases and sales of short term investments as we take advantage of movements in short term interest rates while considering our short term cash requirements 
net cash provided by and used in financing activities

in february  our board of directors authorized an increase to our existing discretionary stock repurchase program of up to million  increasing total repurchase authorizations since september to million 
we expect that during the year ended december  our cash provided by and used in financing activities will remain consistent with our levels 
currency 
although we partially hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk  strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  united kingdom pound sterling  australian and singapore dollars and japanese yen could harm our business

off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds for either operating or strategic purposes and may seek to raise the additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we ever need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders

factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves many risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a discussion that highlights some of these risks 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations or results 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business operations or results could be harmed 
we are in the process of transforming the company from one that focuses on the development and distribution of point solutions to the development and distribution of comprehensive solutions 
if we are unable to complete this transformation quickly and smoothly  our operating results could be harmed 
we are undergoing a transformation from a company that focuses on the development and distribution of discrete development tools to the development and distribution of comprehensive development solutions 
this transformation has taken many forms each of which involves substantial risks  including changes in go to market strategy 
to achieve increased sales force productivity  we must complete more large revenue  multi product sales of our application lifecycle management  or alm  solutions 
to do so  we must coordinate the efforts of our marketing  sales  and services organizations to focus on the needs of large enterprises 
these tasks are complicated and involve many people and processes 
if we fail to coordinate these efforts  we will not satisfy the demands of the large enterprise customers that we are targeting and will not achieve our anticipated revenues 
changes in the make up of our executive management 
several members of our executive management team  including our chief operating officer  our general counsel  and our senior vice president of worldwide sales  recently joined us 
as a result  the executive team has a relatively short history working together  and it is unclear whether they will be able to manage the company effectively 
if they are unable to work together effectively  our business will suffer 
changes in our sales organization 
we have recently focused our sales effort on enterprise customers 
as a part of this effort to transform our sales organization  we have established a new focus on large strategic accounts  re allocated the territories in which our sales force operates and terminated a number 
table of contents of sales professionals 
we are making these changes throughout our global sales force  but they have been particularly acute in the united states 
in addition  to improve upon our sales execution  we recently installed a new sales leadership team 
we expect to continue to make changes in our sales organization to focus more effort on enterprise customers 
these efforts risk precipitating the departure of other sales executives  may prove unsuccessful in increasing our sales to enterprise customers  and may prove unsuccessful in increasing our revenues 
reductions in force 
in an effort to streamline our organization and improve our financial model  we recently reduced the number of employees in the company from  in september to  in february  including a reduction of employees in our research and development operations 
given the substantial cuts that we made  there is a risk that we will not be able to ship new products or product upgrades at the times that we originally planned 
if we experience delays in the shipment of new products or product upgrades  we may lose customers or may not achieve anticipated sales during a particular period 
changes in product mix 
we now offer a wider array of products that focus on the software development needs of large enterprises 
sales to large enterprises often are accompanied by long sales cycles 
given our relative inexperience in serving this market  we may be unable to accurately forecast revenues derived from these customers 
if we fail to accurately forecast revenues  we may not achieve the net income that we anticipate  which could harm our stock price 
international operations 
we now have research facilities in singapore  russia and the czech republic  and we have a direct sales force in place in countries around the world 
we may experience difficulty in efficiently and effectively managing our geographically dispersed organization 
as a result  our results of operations may suffer 
these are just a few of the types of risks associated with transforming the company to a provider of broad software development solutions 
there are several other types of risks inherent in such a process  generally described in the following paragraphs and throughout this document 
while we believe that transforming the organization to focus on the development and delivery of comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers is critical to growing our revenue and achieving higher operating margins  we may be unable to complete this transformation smoothly and quickly 
if we are unable to manage the process smoothly and quickly  our business will be harmed 
we are relatively new to selling comprehensive solutions for the application development lifecycle  and we may not be able to successfully compete in that broader market 
the application development lifecycle market has been evolving  as customers are increasingly demanding software that address each stage of the application development lifecycle 
while we believe we maintain strong relationships with the it organizations in large enterprises through our developer network  we do not have extensive experience selling comprehensive development solutions 
historically  we have focused on selling particular products for particular segments of the application development lifecycle  most notably development tools 
we believe our comprehensive suite of solutions are attractive to large enterprises 
however  we have little history of selling this comprehensive suite of solutions  and we may be unable to transition effectively to selling these solutions to large enterprises 
to compete successfully in the application development lifecycle market  we believe we will need to develop and reinforce corporate level messaging that convinces executive level it professionals of the need to consider our solutions  develop stronger relationships with systems integrators and other strategic partners with access to enterprise accounts  develop stronger relationships with executive level it professionals responsible for making enterprise wide purchasing decisions  
table of contents coordinate the activities of our various product organizations to provide fully integrated products  including synchronizing release cycles  and compete with several very large and well established companies with more experience in these markets 
if we are unable to do any of the foregoing  our operating results will suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in selling into larger enterprises or if we fail to establish strategic relationships with systems integrators  our business will suffer 
historically  our sales efforts have been a combination of an indirect sales channel that sells individual point products and a direct sales force that managed largely modest accounts on the basis of geography 
we have recently focused our sales efforts on selling enterprise wide solutions to large customers  as we believe our future growth will depend in large measure on our ability to sell comprehensive alm solutions to these larger enterprises 
to that end  we have introduced sales personnel who will be dedicated exclusively on named enterprise accounts 
if the introduction of these sales personnel dedicated enterprise accounts is unsuccessful in generating significant revenues from the larger enterprise customers that are our focus  our ability to sell our comprehensive alm suite will be greatly diminished  and as a consequence  our revenues will be harmed 
as part of our new focus on enterprise customers  we are attempting to establish strategic relationships with large systems integrators 
given their access to enterprise customers and their ability to implement our products across large enterprises  we believe these systems integrators are important to our sales  marketing and support activities with large enterprise customers 
if successful  we believe that these relationships will expand the distribution of our products 
to succeed in establishing relationships with these systems integrators  we need to ensure that we provide services that complement the core service offerings of these systems integrators 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining good relations with large systems integrators  our ability to sell our alm solutions to large enterprise will be greatly diminished  and as a consequence  our revenues will be harmed 
our increasing focus on enterprise customers may lengthen our sales cycles and increase fluctuations in our financial results 
as we seek to license our software directly to large enterprises  we have experienced sales cycles that are substantially more lengthy and uncertain than those associated with our traditional business of licensing software through indirect and retail channels 
as we focus on large transactions that involve multiple elements  the enterprise customers  who are the focus of our sales strategy  generally require us to expend substantial time  effort and money in establishing the relationship and in educating them about our solutions 
also  sales to enterprise customers generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the customer s organization and often require final approval by the customer s chief information officer or other senior executive employee 
in particular  we believe that purchase decisions on complete alm solutions often involve more senior level employees than sales of the discrete development products that we have traditionally sold 
these factors substantially extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will be made in any particular quarter  or at all 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays and uncertainty in our sales cycle as well as increased up front expenses in connection with our enterprise sales efforts 
the timing of the execution of enterprise volume licenses  or their non renewal by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter

in the future  we may be unable to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers  extensive knowledge of the market  substantial experience in selling enterprise solutions  and extensive product development  sales and marketing resources 
as a result of their greater resources and established relationships  these competitors may be more successful than we are at developing and marketing products in our markets 
bundling arrangements or product give aways by our competitors  including freely available development technologies  may diminish demand for our products or pressure us to reduce our prices 
some of our competitors  particularly those that are primarily hardware vendors or platform providers  generate a substantially greater proportion of their sales in markets in which we do not directly compete 
we believe a number of these competitors view sales of software development technologies as important for enhancing the functionality of  and demand for  their core products 
as a result  some companies may bundle software development products that compete with our offerings with their other products  such as application servers  work stations  personal computers  operating systems and databases 
when competitors do so  the effective price for software development products that compete with our development products may be heavily 
table of contents discounted or offered at no charge 
this could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  diminish our revenues and harm our profitability 
similarly  industry alliances and arrangements exist or may be formed in the future under which our competitors ally with companies in markets in which we do not compete to bundle products 
these arrangements may result in lower effective prices for our competitors products than our products  putting pressure on our business and diminishing our competitive position 
in addition to bundled offerings and bundling arrangements  some competitors make available to their customers for no charge products that compete with our software development solutions  including our jbuilder product 
while we believe that products made available at minimal or no cost are not able to compete with our offerings on the basis of quality  performance and reliability  freely available competitive technologies are a risk to our business 
at a minimum  technologies offered at no charge increase pricing pressure and threaten revenue potential 
for example  ibm has donated some of its proprietary software to the open source eclipse initiative 
eclipse has created an open source toolkit in which customers can access and create development technologies at no charge 
wide adoption of this model may reduce demand for some of our products 
a number of factors affecting our revenues make our future results for a particular period difficult to predict  and therefore we may not meet expectations for a particular period 
we believe that our revenues have the potential to vary significantly from time to time 
these variations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
we believe that these variations may result from many factors  including  but not limited to our limited experience in consistently forecasting revenues across all of our business units and across our geographic regions  the mix of channels through which we sell our products  timing  and any delay in the introduction  of upgrades to existing products or releases of new products  the relative mix of demand for our various products and services  the size and timing of significant orders and their fulfillment  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  customer order deferrals  and product defects that may be discovered from time to time and other product quality problems 
as a result of the foregoing  revenues may be difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues for a quarterly period may not be known until late in the quarter 
additionally  our costs  while based on projected revenues  are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  if our revenue levels fall below projections  net income may be significantly reduced or result in losses 
as a result  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results will continue to be difficult to forecast  and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of trends or our future performance 
we depend on technologies licensed to us by third parties  particularly sun microsystems and microsoft  and the loss of or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales or shipments of certain of our products 
we are dependent on licenses from third party suppliers for some elements of our products such as various file libraries 
in particular  we depend on technology licenses from sun microsystems for our java and janeva products  and we depend on licenses from microsoft for our delphi  c builder  c builder and janeva products 
if any of these licenses were terminated or were not renewed  or if these third parties failed to notify us in a timely manner of any new or updated technology  we might not be able to ship such products or provide support for such products  including upgrades 
we would then have to seek an alternative to the third party s 
table of contents technology and  in some cases  an alternative may not exist 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs or reduced functionality of our products  which in turn could substantially reduce our revenues 
our historical financial results are based on sales of development solutions for currently adopted languages 
as the markets for our products in these currently adopted languages mature  our revenues could be harmed 
our historical financial information relating to a number of our software development technologies is based on sales of software designed to develop applications for currently adopted platforms and languages eg  windows  c and java as well as traditional computer hardware platforms eg  mainframes  work stations  applications servers  desktop personal computers  notebook computers 
for example  many of our most popular products are focused on the java language and platform  and we continue to invest heavily in software solutions for the java platform as it evolves  including enterprise focused standards such as java platform  enterprise edition jee  and enterprise javabeans ejb 
recently  the growth of the market for our java solutions has slowed 
similarly  our deployment products  including borland enterprise server  are based on common object request broker architecture  or corba  a standard for communicating across large enterprise networks 
corba provides a way to execute software programs written in different programming languages running on different platforms no matter where they reside in the network 
while we believe that corba has achieved widespread acceptance  critics contend that its penetration tends to be narrow and deep  resulting in large investments by relatively few enterprises 
as a result  while we continue to enhance the functionality of these products and expect sales of these technologies to continue to generate a significant percentage of our revenues  we believe these markets are maturing 
if java and corba do not sustain the level of adoption that we anticipate  our expected revenues would diminish 
if our products for microsoft s 
net framework are not successful  our business would be harmed 
we are currently investing resources in our research and development efforts for the 
net framework  microsoft s new operating environment for software applications 
while we have and will continue to release software products that support the 
net framework  our business would be harmed if our products for the 
net framework fail to address the needs of our customers  or if our competitors  particularly microsoft  develop more effective or efficient products 
in addition  despite our efforts to provide effective and compatible development products for the 
net framework  customers may still elect to use an all microsoft development platform 
furthermore  the success of our 
net products is dependent upon microsoft gaining market acceptance of its 
net framework 
if microsoft s 
net framework does not gain market acceptance or gains acceptance more slowly than we anticipate  our investments in 
net compatible products may not generate their anticipated return 
in conjunction with the 
net framework  microsoft has a new development language  c 
an alternative to java  c is an object oriented programming language and is based on c 
we believe that c is gaining in market acceptance 
if certain emerging programming languages  such as microsoft s c  gain significantly in popularity and we do not offer a development technology to facilitate development in such languages  our competitiveness could be diminished 
if we are unable to meet rapid changes in technology and introduce competitive products  our existing products could become technologically obsolete 
the market for our products is characterized by continuous technological advancement  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
while we believe that to date we have successfully developed products that incorporate the latest technologies and standards  we cannot be certain that we will successfully design and market new products and upgrades of our current products that are competitive and work with existing and new computer platforms and operating environments 
this is especially true regarding the development of comprehensive solutions for the 
net framework 

table of contents additionally  we face a number of competitive risks in the software market  including  but not limited to  the following competitors may introduce products earlier than we do  competitors may introduce competing products at lower prices or potentially at no cost  our products may not meet customers expectations regarding features and performance  competitors products based on new technologies or new industry standards may render our existing products obsolete  the free availability of certain new technologies may lower barriers to entry in our target markets  and in order to match actions by competitors  we may need to provide product upgrades at lower prices  which may result in lower margins and decreased operating results 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business may be harmed 
if our products do not operate with the wide variety of hardware  software  operating systems  environments and programming languages used by our customers  our revenues would be harmed 
our customers use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software and operating platforms 
we invest and will continue to invest significant resources to develop products for new or emerging software and hardware platforms in the server  desktop  personal digital assistant  mobile  wireless and other environments that may develop from time to time 
however  there is a risk that a new hardware or software platform for which we do not provide products could rapidly grow in popularity 
in particular  we believe that this risk is substantial for particular proprietary platforms and languages for which we may not be given economically feasible access or access at all 
as a result  we may not be in a position to develop products for such platforms or may be late in doing so 
if we fail to introduce new products that address the needs of emerging market segments or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance as a result of delays in development or other factors  our future growth and revenue opportunity could suffer 
we rely on independent software vendors  value added resellers  systems integrators and other channel partners to complement our direct sales 
if we cease doing business with one or more of these parties  our revenues could suffer 
we rely on independent software vendors  or isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and other channel partners to complement our direct sales 
the pricing  terms and conditions of our agreements with these parties are individually negotiated and vary 
a majority of these agreements are non exclusive 
many of our agreements do not require these channel partners to make a minimum number of purchases  and we have virtually no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems shipped by our channel partners 
although we believe our relationships with these parties have been successful to date  we cannot guarantee that these relationships will continue to be successful or grow or that the channel partners will continue to purchase our products at the anticipated levels in the future 
if we do not maintain good relations with our channel and other partners or if we are unable to secure arrangements with these parties on favorable terms  our business may suffer 
in addition  we depend on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect that a small number of distributors will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
presently  some software distributors are experiencing financial weakness 
if we lose a major distributor  such as ingram micro  or if we fail to increase the number of our distributors  our ability to maintain or increase our market share could be significantly harmed 
as a result  our revenues could drop quickly and unexpectedly 

table of contents failure to expand our professional services offerings and enlist others to provide services for our products could harm our ability to sell comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers 
we believe that growth in our licenses and other revenues will depend on our ability to provide our customers with comprehensive professional services and to enlist other parties to provide similar services  including systems integrators  distributors and other channel partners 
these professional services include maintenance  architectural consulting  training  education and project management 
if we fail to attract  train and retain skilled personnel or to establish beneficial relationships with system integrators to deliver professional services  our ability to sell comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers could be seriously harmed 
competition for qualified professional services personnel is intense  and we may be unable to attract  train and retain the number of highly qualified professional services personnel that we need 
our strategic relationships may not achieve their objectives  and the failure to do so could impede our growth 
we currently maintain a number of important strategic alliances and technology relationships with industry leaders such as bea systems  mercury interactive  microsoft  nokia and sun microsystems 
our current technology relationships give us  among other things  early access to emerging technologies  additional resources to market our products  and an entry point to contact potential customers 
similarly  our strategic relationships with systems integrators  such as accenture  and resellers provide additional expertise to our customers and bolster our service capabilities 
in the future  we anticipate exploring additional strategic alliances  technology relationships and other arrangements designed to further all of these goals 
our current or prospective strategic alliances and technology relationships may not achieve their intended objectives  however  and parties to our strategic alliances and technology relationships may not perform as contemplated 
additionally  our allies may choose to terminate their arrangements with us where no binding contractual arrangements exist 
the failure to develop or maintain our strategic alliances and technology relationships or our allies inability to perform or to opt out of their arrangements with us may impede our ability to introduce new products or enter new markets  and consequently harm our revenue prospects 
failure to manage our international operations could harm our financial results 
a substantial portion of our revenues is from international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in the year ended december   with each of germany and japan accounting for significant portions of our total revenue 
in addition  following our acquisition of togethersoft  an increasing portion of our operations consists of activities outside the united states 
we now have research facilities in singapore  sweden  russia and the czech republic 
we rely on personnel in our international locations to properly account for and manage our international operations 
given our increasing presence in international markets and the potential for sales of our products in international markets  our business is increasingly subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally  including the difficulty of staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries and continents  potentially reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights than is available under the laws of the united states  longer payment cycles in some countries and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on the expatriation of currency from a particular country  export restrictions  tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  changes in regulatory requirements and resulting costs  compliance with various conflicting laws and regulations  including employment laws  and resulting costs  
table of contents terrorist activity  and war  threats of war or political or economic instability in certain parts of the world 
one or more of these risks could harm our future research operations and international sales 
if we are unable to manage these risks of doing business internationally  our results of operations could suffer 
because competition for qualified technical and management personnel is intense  we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel  which could harm the development of our products 
we believe that our ability to successfully grow and manage our business and to develop new products will depend  in large part  on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled software engineers and management personnel 
in the past  some of our competitors have utilized their greater resources to provide substantial signing bonuses and other inducements to lure key personnel away from us 
this is particularly the case with technical and management personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  who are completely vested or almost completely vested in their options to purchase stock 
we are not certain that our efforts to retain our key employees will succeed  and our failure to attract and retain key personnel could significantly harm our business 
consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation continues to occur among companies that compete in our markets as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and to take advantage of efficiencies and economies of scale 
additionally  a number of major hardware companies have sought to expand their software and services offerings through acquisitions 
in early  ibm acquired rational software  a competitor of ours 
changes resulting from this and other consolidations may harm our competitive position  particularly as certain products  when offered as part of a bundled suite  are offered for free or are given away to sell more hardware or infrastructure components 
in addition  as the trend toward consolidation continues  we may encounter increased competition for attractive acquisition targets and may have to pay higher prices for those businesses or technologies we seek to acquire 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our ability to effectively manage our businesses could be diminished and our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends on growing our company 
failure to manage growth effectively could strain our resources  which would impede our ability to increase revenues 
during the past two years  we have increased the number of product releases we make each year and have introduced a number of new products and services 
in addition  we have undertaken a number of acquisitions in the last two years  diversified our product offerings and increased our international operations 
there is a risk  especially following our recent reductions in force  that we will be unable to manage the growth that we have recently experienced and that we will be unable to manage our increasingly dispersed company  including our international operations 
if we fail to manage these risks  our operating results could suffer 
as we expand and diversify our product and customer base  we may be required to increase staffing and other expenditures in order to meet the anticipated demands of our customers 
however  given that our customers do not commit to license our software for more than a short time in advance  any increase in expenses in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize could reduce our net income 
if we are unable to match our increased staffing and other expenditures with similarly increased revenue  our profitability would be harmed 
we may incur future impairment losses related to intangible assets from prior acquisitions that could harm our future operating results 
we have recently acquired significant assets and businesses 
if the assets and businesses do not perform as expected  we may be required to take impairment charges related to the intangible assets from these acquisitions 
such charges could harm our operating results 

table of contents we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may change our effective tax rate and in turn have a material effect on our income 
our effective tax rate is primarily dependent on the location of our taxable profits  if any  due to our net operating loss carryforwards in certain  but not all  jurisdictions  and the imposition of withholding taxes on revenues regardless of our profitability 
we have significant us federal and state income tax net operating losses 
for us federal and state income tax purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million at december   respectively 
we also had available us federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these loss and credit carryforwards expire between and  if not utilized 
utilization of federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
we also have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions 
certain of these loss carryforwards will expire in to the extent we are unable to utilize these loss and credit carryforwards  our effective tax rate will rise 
a higher effective tax rate may harm our future after tax income 
in january   we completed the acquisitions of starbase and togethersoft 
as a result  we succeeded to the pre acquisition federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of both companies 
utilization of these federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to a similar annual limitation as discussed above 
we may not be able to complete our restructuring efforts at a cost and a time that we presently anticipate  and the failure to do so may result in additional expense in future periods  which would harm our results of operations 
during  we restructured our operations 
as part of these restructurings  we consolidated our operations and reduced the amount of excess facilities we leased 
excising ourselves from our lease commitments will require us to negotiate certain lease terminations and or subleases 
we cannot predict when or if we will be successful in negotiating these lease termination agreements or subleases on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unsuccessful in such negotiations or if the negotiated terms are less favorable than currently anticipated  we may be required to materially increase our restructuring charge in future periods  which would harm our results of operations in those periods 
in addition  our restructuring efforts may not achieve all of the benefits we currently anticipate 
our products may contain unknown defects that could result in a loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
software products occasionally contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
we have not experienced any substantial problems to date from potential defects and errors  but we cannot assure you that our products are or in the future will be completely free of defects and errors 
the discovery of a defect or error in a new version or product may result in the following consequences  among others delayed shipping of the product  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 

table of contents in addition  as we transition to selling larger  comprehensive solutions  there is the risk that our current products will not prove scalable without substantial effort 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets 
as a software company  our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  domain name registrations  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights  but these measures may provide only limited protection 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriations of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse engineer or decompile our software products 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights  particularly in certain international markets  making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights  and such litigation can be time consuming and expensive 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly litigation or settlement terms or limited sales of our products 
from time to time  we have received notices claiming that we have infringed a third party s patent or other intellectual property right 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality becomes more widespread 
further  the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require in some situations that a costly opinion of counsel be obtained to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
regardless of its merits  responding to any claim can be time consuming and costly and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  discontinue use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that might not be offered or be available on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim were made against us and we failed to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims or our insurance coverage for these types of claims may not be adequate 
intentional efforts to harm or disrupt the functioning of our software could harm our reputation and result in significant unexpected costs 
our products or services may be the target of intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate proprietary information 
if these efforts were successful  our activities could be substantially disrupted  and our reputation and future sales could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address the foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into various hedging transactions as described below 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries and have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets denominated in non functional currencies 
the goal of the hedging program is to offset the earnings impact of 
table of contents non functional currency balances 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes or to hedge cash flow risks 
at month end  short term non functional currency balances and the forward exchange contracts are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
during the year ended december   we recorded net foreign exchange gains of million 
the foreign exchange gains were generated primarily due to the strength of the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar 
it is uncertain whether these currency trends will continue 
if these currency trends do not continue  we may experience foreign exchange losses on our intercompany receivables and other non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities to the extent that we have not hedged the exposure with foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
any foreign exchange losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
during the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency gain of approximately million as a part of other comprehensive income due to foreign currency movements on our long term intercompany balances 
as of december   we had million  million and million in long term intercompany balances that will be settled in australian dollars  singapore dollars and brazilian reales  respectively 
movement of in the euro in relation to the us dollar on december  would have had an impact of approximately million on our net assets on december  the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments  comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts  as presented in our financial statements

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments such as commercial paper 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million to any one commercial issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in securities rated at least a p as published by standard and poors and moodys and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in the

our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary and resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio held as of december  dollar amounts in thousands 
the difference in the average interest rate associated with cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to interest rates on overseas investments
