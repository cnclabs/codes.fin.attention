during the fourth quarter of  the company consolidated its health insurance coverage for three of its us operations to a single carrier to gain control over increasing health insurance costs 
the company continually seeks competitive quotes within the property and liability insurance markets 
pension costs have increased dramatically due to the cumulative effects of depressed investment returns over the last few years  which reduced the value of fund assets 
however  in the market began to rebound  and the company s pension assets realized a return for the year 
if the company can continue to achieve returns in excess of its target over the next few years  this cost should begin to decline 
during  the company decided it would be more cost effective to close its florida software development office and consolidate it into its greenwald office in chester  connecticut 
as a result  the company incurred a cost of  however  it expects to recoup this expense in through greater efficiency and shortened software development time

in  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
 which addresses when a company should consolidate an entity based on the variable interest model of fin no 
it defines a variable interest entity vies as those entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks 
for all vies formed after february   fin no 
is effective for fiscal years or interim periods beginning after june  for all other vies  fin no 
is effective for periods ending after march  fin no 
did not have any impact on the company s financial position and results of operations in fiscal the company has identified an entity  formed before february   that may be a vie 
the potential vie is a vendor of the company  located in china  formed solely for the benefit of the company 
the company does not have any ownership interest in the potential vie but does provide all of the financial support to the potential vie to facilitate the production of various materials used within the company s production and owns the equipment used by the potential vie to manufacture the products 
because the company does not have an ownership interest in the potential vie  the company has been unable to obtain reliable financial information to determine whether the entity is a vie  determine whether the company is the vie s primary beneficiary or perform the accounting required to consolidate the vie 
therefore  the company is unable at this time to estimate the potential impact the consolidation of the potential vie may have on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make its estimates and assumptions  but actual results will inevitably differ from the estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair presentation of the company 
management believes that the application of these estimates and assumptions on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  that is  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and geographic risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory reserve inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method at the company s us facilities 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the dollar value link chain method 
we review the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
based on these assessments  we provide for an inventory reserve in the period in which an impairment is identified 
the reserve fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
prior to  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were amortized over periods ranging from to years 
each year during the second quarter  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment 
during  the company used the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of goodwill associated with its reporting units  no impairments of goodwill were deemed to exist 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  profit margin assumptions are projected by each business based on the current cost structures and anticipated cost reductions 
there can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related discounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and an impairment of assets might need to be recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions about such factors as expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and trends in health insurance costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and updated as required 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firms 
also considered is the company s historical experience with pension fund asset performance in comparison with expected returns 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was 
the company reviews the long term rate of return each year 
future actual pension income and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the declines in recent years in the equity markets and interest rates have had a negative impact on the company s pension plan liability and the fair value of its plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at the end of for two of the company s plans  which resulted in a million charge to shareholders equity in the fourth quarter of that year 
the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately million for   of which was paid in december results of operations the following table shows  for  each line item from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales

the rebound in the tractor trailer market utilizing heavy hardware could be adversely affected by higher steel prices and diminishing allocation of raw materials 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers increased in this increase was due to orders from new customers and higher demand for truck service bodies 
however  sales to distributors were down from  primarily because of continued softness in this sector of our business 
sales of school bus door closures increased in  reflecting a greater volume of business with our primary bus hardware customer 
sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches declined as a result of domestic and offshore competition in this market 
sales at the company s mexican operation decreased from primarily due to a lack of economic growth in mexico

in the security products segment  sales were higher than in volume of existing products increased sales by  while new product introductions increased them by 
sales of locks to the computer industry declined slightly in sales of high security locks for coin operated vending and gaming equipment were up in that increase was primarily the result of our gaining market share from our competition in an otherwise flat market 
sales of locks to distributors servicing lower volume accounts decreased slightly  while sales to the industrial controls and accessories market decreased 
sales of locks for access doors  furniture  electronics equipment and vehicular applications were up from levels  mainly through taking market share from our competition 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry declined 
sales to this market had been hard hit in the wake of the september   terrorist attacks  and they continued to be impacted by a transportation security administration tsa declaration that passengers should not lock their checked baggage on commercial airline flights 
responding to the tsa declaration  the ccl security products division in late  introduced the searchalerttm  a new lock which meets all the requirements established by travel sentrytm  the standard setting group created to work closely with the tsa and the luggage lock manufacturers 
searchalerttm allows the tsa to unlock and inspect airline passengers bags without destroying the lock and lets the bags owner know if the bag has been opened via an access indicator 
the company expects this lock to have a significant effect on luggage lock sales in sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry increased from sales of smart card products increased in  partially offsetting declines that occurred in sales of two of the company s mature products for the laundry sector

sales of contract castings were down from  the decrease was mainly due to the company s decision to focus more intensively on its proprietary mine roof anchor systems in light of increased competition from china and mexico on contract castings 
because of lower labor and operating costs in these countries or favorable currency exchange rates  the price of imported castings is often below that of us produced castings 
however  the company will continue to offer contract castings to customers when profit margins are acceptable 
in order to maintain utilization rates in its factory  the company has been developing capabilities for producing castings from ductile iron previously  it used only malleable iron in its castings business 
while the company has filled several small orders  the company is still refining and perfecting its ductile iron capabilities 
although the new capabilities will enable the company to supply additional products and services to its customers  further capital investments may be required to make the casting of larger quantities possible 
sales of mine roof support anchors decreased slightly from  reflecting lower demand for these products as a result of fairly stable weather conditions 
demand for mine roof support anchors supplied to the coal mining industry is dependent on demand for power  which increases during abnormally warm summers or abnormally cold winters 
the demand for power  in turn  affects coal supplies 
the new energy information administration eia projects that coal will increase its share of us electricity generation from in to by the national energy policy legislation currently before congress aims at providing affordable coal based electricity to business and consumers and at providing additional incentives for the deployment of clean coal technologies 
the eia s annual energy outlook increased its projection by to gigawatts of new coal fired generating capacity plants will be deployed over the next years 
management continues to believe that coal will remain the backbone of the us energy supply 
total coal production in is projected to increase from although the demand for coal is influenced by the weather  the rising price of natural gas  advances in hydrogen technology and the growing need for fuel diversity have positioned coal usage for growth

this increase was mainly due to improved sales volume 
in the metal products segment  pretax earnings rose  or  due to elimination of lower margin contract casting products and cost reductions

sales of heavy hardware to the tractor trailer industry decreased from levels 
sales to this market have been down since the latter half of in the second quarter of  the trailer industry began to see signs of recovery when trailer orders rose to their highest level in nine quarters 
despite the overall improvement in the trailer industry  several of our customers saw their trailer sales decline from the previous year 
however  with the continued slow economy and record high fuel costs  the trailer industry s recovery could be weakened 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers and distributors were down from sales of school bus door closures increased in as customers came back to our standard door control after moving in to the linear door control design used by a competitor  the competitor s products subsequently resulted in numerous user complaints 
sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches rose  the improved demand for our hardware was due to an increase in sales of light trucks that resulted from auto industry promotions 
sales at the company s mexican operation decreased from primarily due to economic conditions in mexico 
canadian commercial vehicles currently does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
however  the product it produces lends itself to the industrial  transportation and marine industries  markets to which we presently provide locking  latching and other hardware devices 
this acquisition will open opportunities for both eberhard manufacturing and canadian commercial vehicles to sell complete systems such as doors or hatches with the hardware pre installed 
the company intends to invest in the resources necessary to expand canadian commercial vehicles current operations and focus it on additional market areas such as the automotive  recreational vehicle and marine industries 
in addition  this acquisition gives the company an opportunity to introduce its automotive accessory hardware into the class truck market  an area where it has had little presence previously

in march  the company acquired certain assets of the big tag division of dolan enterprises  inc among these assets was a high visibility luggage tag the big tag r which the company is marketing with its prestolock r to the travel and premium markets 
sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry increased from sales of smart card products continued to grow  offsetting any declines that occurred in sales of the company s mature products for the laundry sector 
the growth in smart card product sales was driven by greater acceptance of smart card technology among both existing and new customers 
the successful introduction of our new coin acceptor product also contributed to the higher sales to the laundry industry 
during the year  the company completed its move of the ccl security products division from new britain  connecticut  to wheeling  illinois  where it was combined with the company s illinois lock company division 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
volume accounted for the reduction in sales 
sales of contract castings were down from this decrease was mainly due to the loss of customers who decided to source their contract casting work from china and mexico 
because of lower labor and operating costs in these countries coupled with favorable currency exchange rates  the price of imported castings is often below that of us produced castings 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company began to phase out its low margin contract casting business and concentrate instead on its proprietary mine roof anchor systems 
however  the company will continue to offer contract castings to customers when profit margins are acceptable 
in addition  to maintain utilization rates in its factory  the company has developed capabilities for producing castings from ductile iron previously  it used only malleable iron for its castings business 
the new capabilities will enable the company to supply additional products and services to its customers 
sales of mine roof support anchors decreased from during  demand for these products declined as a result of an unusually warm winter  which caused the demand for electric power to drop for the first time in years 
faced with a lower demand for power  utility companies reduced their use of coal

the gross margin percentage for was approximately percentage point below the level versus 
total selling and administrative expenses were down  or  from the decrease was due to the elimination of the goodwill amortization expense in as a result of the company s adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no

the security products segment experienced an increase of  or  in pretax earnings 
this increase was mainly due to an upturn in sales volume and increased efficiency resulting from the consolidation of ccl security products into the company s illinois lock company 
in the metal products segment  pretax earnings were down  or million  due to an reduction in sales volume  an underutilization of productive capacity  personnel costs associated with the downsizing of operations  and a significant increase in workers costs 
the growth in workers compensation costs stemmed from both the current year premium and additional expenses associated with claims under prior year policies 
the company reached the additional maximum expense approximately  in corporate expenses were  or million  more than they were in the increase was due to higher personnel expenses in  and the fact that corporate expense included a one time pre tax gain of  associated with the issuance of stock by prudential financial inc during its demutualization and changeover to a public company 
the effective tax rate in was  down from in the lower rate for was due to the company s deriving a higher percentage of its earnings from countries with a lower tax rate 
liquidity and sources of capital the company s financial position remained strong throughout the primary source of the company s cash is earnings from operating activities adjusted for cash generated from or used in net working capital 
the most significant recurring non cash items included in income are depreciation and amortization expense 
changes in working capital fluctuate with the changes in operating activities 
as sales increase there generally is an increased requirement for working capital 
since increases in working capital reduce the company s cash  management attempts to keep the company s investment in net working capital at a reasonable level by closely monitoring inventory levels and matching production to expected market demand  keeping tight control over collection of receivables and optimizing payment terms on its trade and other payables 
the company is dependent on the continued demand for our products and subsequent collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
the company serves a broad base of customers and industries with a variety of products 
as a result  any fluctuations in a particular industry or customer will not have a material impact on the company s sales and collection of receivables

its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales less than of total sales to nonaffiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar  chinese rmb and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to any single foreign market  any currency exchange gains or losses have not been material and are not expected to be material 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its unsecured loan agreement  which provides for interest based on libor plus a spread of up to 
the spread is determined by a comparison of the company s operating performance with agreed upon financial targets 
since the company s performance depends to a large extent on the overall economy  the interest rate paid by the company under its loan agreement is closely linked to the trend in the us economy 
the current interest rate spread is on the term loan portion and on the revolving credit line portion of the loan agreement 
changes in libor rates will also affect the company s interest expense 
to hedge against future libor rate increases  the company has a swap contract on a portion of the term loan under the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the swap contract is and the swap contract expires on july  the notional amount of the swap contract is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the notional amount of the swap contract was million as of january  the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause an  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
