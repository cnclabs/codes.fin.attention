item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture high quality nutritional and personal care products that are distributed through network marketing 
net sales are primarily dependent upon the efforts of a network of independent associates who purchase products and sales materials 
as of january   we had approximately  active associates in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand  hong kong  japan  taiwan  south korea  singapore  and the united kingdom 
we also sell products directly to preferred customers who purchase products for personal use and are not permitted to resell or distribute the products 
as of january   we had approximately  active preferred customers worldwide 
for purposes of this report  we only count as active customers those associates and preferred customers who have purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent three month period 
prior to  we defined our active customers as those associates and preferred customers who purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent month period 
we have adopted the three month methodology because we believe it is a more meaningful measurement of our network marketing system 
the change in this measure has no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as discussed more fully in segment information note k of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have two reportable segments direct selling and contract manufacturing 
the direct selling segment constitutes our principal line of business developing  manufacturing  and distributing nutritional and personal care products through a network marketing system 
the contract manufacturing segment includes the manufacture of premium personal care products  produced under the brand name of its customers  including manufacturing and packaging for the company s sens product line of skin and personal care products 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and title passes to our customers 
in  sales in the eight primary geographic regions within our direct selling segment contributed to consolidated net sales as follows united states canada australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore sales from the contract manufacturing segment accounted for the remaining of consolidated net sales in as we expand our business into additional international markets  we expect international operations to account for an increasing percentage of net sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance  and overhead directly associated with the production and distribution of products and sales materials  as well as duties and taxes associated with product exports 
as international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales could increase slightly  reflecting additional duties  freight and other expenses associated with international growth 
associate incentive expenses are incurred only by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant expense for this segment at of net segment sales in associate incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses that are paid weekly based on sales volume points 
certain promotions and contests are also reported as associate incentives 
most products are assigned a sales volume point value independent of the product s price 
associates earn commissions based on sales volume points generated in their downline sales organization 
starter kits and sales aids have no sales volume point value and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items 
we closely monitor the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may from time to time adjust the associate compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
this must be done while continuing to maintain an appropriate incentive for associates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate events  promotion and advertising  and professional fees along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our founder and chairman of the board of directors  dr 
wentz  does not receive any compensation for his services in the capacity of ceo and he has in the past declined to accept any stock options or other awards under any stock option or stock incentive plan that he might otherwise have been entitled to receive as an executive officer 
if dr 
wentz were paid a salary  or if someone other than dr 
wentz were to be retained as chief executive officer and paid a customary salary and benefits  selling  general  and administrative expenses would increase as a result of the compensation paid 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include significant depreciation and amortization expense incurred as a result of continued investments in computer and telecommunications equipment and systems to support international expansion 
we anticipate that significant additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support anticipated growth in sales and the increasing size of our customer base 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  enhancing existing products  and formulating products for introduction into international markets 
the company is in the practice of providing guidance concerning anticipated net sales 
based on information currently available to the company  we expect annual net sales in the range of to million for fiscal year results of operations the following table summarizes operating results as a percentage of net sales  respectively  for the periods indicated fiscal year consolidated statements of earnings data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses associate incentives selling  general  and administrative research and development total operating expenses earnings from operations other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales 
net sales increased  or million  to million for  from million in this increase was composed of million associated with our direct selling segment and million associated with our contract manufacturing segment acquired in july the following table summarizes the growth in net sales by segment and geographic region for the fiscal years ended december  and january sales by segment and region in thousands year ended change from prior year percent change segment region direct selling united states canada australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea n a singapore n a segment total contract manufacturing n a consolidated the increase in net sales contributed by the direct selling segment can be primarily attributed to the following factors a increase in the active associate base and a increase in the active preferred customer base for the year ended in markets that have been open longer than one year  a million increase in net sales in taiwan due to a full year of operations  stronger foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  which positively affected the translation of sales in foreign markets by approximately million  and an additional week of reported sales in that added approximately million fiscal year was a week year and fiscal year was a week year 
we commenced operations in south korea and singapore in july and november  respectively 
these new markets provided an increase of approximately to the active associate base and contributed million and million in net sales  respectively for the fiscal year ended january  additionally  the acquisition of wpd  effective july  contributed million to the increase in consolidated net sales 
the following tables summarize the growth in active customers for the direct selling segment by geographic region as of the dates indicated active associates by region region as of december  as of january  change from prior year percent change united states canada australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea n a singapore n a total we believe that various factors contributed to the increase in the active associate base  including general enthusiasm created by international expansion  ongoing communication with associate leaders in the field  improved infrastructure to enhance the associate service level  and company sponsored events and promotions held to motivate associates

consolidated gross profit improved to of net sales in from in direct selling s gross profit improved to of net sales for the segment in from in gross profit for the contract manufacturing segment was of net segment sales for the increase in gross profit for the direct selling segment can be attributed primarily to cost improvement in procurement and production activities  a change in pricing that creates greater incentives for our associates that generally contributes to a higher gross profit margin  and leverage benefits of variable costs on a rising sales base 
recently  we have experienced an increase in the purchase price for one of our key raw materials coenzyme q coq  due to a general increase in demand among nutritional supplement companies that manufacture products containing this ingredient and a corresponding shortage among suppliers as they re tool their facilities to increase their production capacity in order to accommodate the rising demand 
usana nutritional products that are affected by the raw material shortage include coquinone and mega antioxidant  which is also included in the usana essentials and healthpak 
we believe this shortage will be a short term phenomenon and expect that the supply will return to normal levels around mid year we have multiple sources to supply this raw ingredient and are confident that we can obtain the necessary quantities  however  it is likely that any quantities acquired during this shortage will be purchased at higher prices  which would negatively impact gross margins for those products affected 
in  we expect to achieve only marginal improvement in our gross profit percentage when compared to associate incentives 
expenses related to associate incentives are incurred only by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant cost as a percentage of net sales for this segment 
associate incentives increased to of net segment sales in from in this increase can be attributed to a change in pricing that creates greater incentives for our associates  an increase in the commission payout rate in the australia new zealand market with no corresponding increase in the price at which we sell our products  the elimination of payment processing fees charged to customers in our north america and australia new zealand markets  and additional spending for special associate promotions and contests during we believe that associate incentives  as a percentage of net sales for the direct selling segment during will remain at a level consistent with the associate incentives expense 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease as a percentage of net sales can be primarily attributed to the increase in net sales during while selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from to  in absolute terms  these expenses increased million or in  the majority of which can be attributed to the direct selling segment 
the acquisition of the contract manufacturing segment added  to the absolute dollar increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses contributed by the direct selling segment can be primarily attributed to the following factors increased spending in our more mature markets to support growing sales and an increasing customer base  increased spending in our new markets of taiwan  south korea  and singapore of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  increased spending on certain expenses  including employee and management performance incentives  associate related expenses  and insurance costs  and higher translated us dollars of foreign currency expenses  totaling million  as a result of a weaker us dollar 
selling  general  and administrative expense in included one time costs totaling million associated with a proposed sale of assets transaction  which was abandoned by the company 
we believe that selling  general  and administrative expenses will decrease in as a percentage of net sales when compared to we believe this decrease will likely occur as a result of leverage benefits on a rising sales base 
we do  however  expect that these expenses will rise in absolute terms as a result of increased variable costs related to higher sales  a growing customer base  and additional costs associated with the opening of mexico in the first quarter of other income expense 
other income expense changed from other expense of  in to other income of  in this increase in net other income of  can be primarily attributed to lower interest expense and higher interest income 
these improvements are due to the retirement of debt during the first quarter of income taxes 
as a result of increased revenue and profitability in our foreign markets during  we generated significant tax benefits in the current year  yielding an effective tax rate of 
we expect that the effective tax rate for will be approximately due to the following the utilization of a foreign tax credit carryforward in the tax year that is not expected to occur again in the tax year  and an increase in the federal income tax rate in the united states from to on anticipated earnings growth

during the fourth quarter of  we commenced operations in taiwan

 consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses associate incentives selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses earnings from operations other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings we may experience variations in the results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of factors that include the following the recruiting and retention of associates  the opening of new markets  the timing of company sponsored associate events  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  new product introductions  the timing of holidays  especially in the fourth quarter  which may reduce the amount of time associates spend selling products or recruiting new associates  the negative impact of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict the sale of certain products  the adverse effect of a failure by us or an associate  or allegations of a failure  to comply with applicable governmental regulations  the integration and operation of new information technology systems  the inability to introduce new products or the introduction of new products by competitors  availability of raw materials  general conditions in the nutritional supplement  personal care  and weight management industries or the network marketing industry  and consumer perceptions of our products and operations 
because our products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we are highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and efficacy of our products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more products or other products similar to the products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  quarterly revenues  expenses  and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurred  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed growth primarily with cash flows from operations 
in  cash flows from operating activities generated net cash of million compared to million in cash and cash equivalents increased to million at january   from million at december  on january   we had net working capital of million compared to million at december  the improvement in net working capital was primarily a result of the increase in cash flows from operating activities 
as of january   our credit facilities consisted of a million line of credit  with no amounts outstanding 
we are currently negotiating an agreement with our financial institution to provide a new line of credit 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million at december   to million for the year ended january  the increase consisted of million associated with the acquisition of wpd and million related to purchases of property plant and equipment 
during the fiscal year ended january   directors  officers  and employees exercised options with proceeds to the company totaling million 
under our stock repurchase plan  we expended million to purchase  shares of common stock during we believe that current cash balances  amounts available under the line of credit  and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to cover our capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
we might also require or seek additional financing  including through the sale of equity securities to finance future expansion into new markets  finance capital acquisitions associated with growth  and for other reasons 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
contractual obligations and commercial contingencies the following table summarizes our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to january  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase commitments capital commitments line of credit other commitments total contractual obligations obligations for operating leases contain the assumption that  in the normal course of business  any operating leases that expire within the time frame represented will be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties  assuming operations continue and will extend  at a maximum  through inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective judgments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as described in this section 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements  revenue is recognized at the point of shipment of the merchandise  at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
for our direct selling segment  we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers 
a reserve for product returns and allowances is provided for and is founded on historical experience 
additionally  we collect an annual renewal fee from our associates that is recognized on a straight line basis over a subsequent twelve month period 
under the guidelines of emerging issues task force no eitf  certain sales incentives offered by a company to customers  including discounts  coupons  and rebates  are generally presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of products  and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in a company s income statement 
associate incentives paid under our compensation plan include commissions and leadership bonuses that are paid based on sales volume points assigned to products independent of the product s price and do not include discounts  coupons  or rebates 
currently  associate incentives are classified as a component of operating expenses  and we believe that this is the appropriate treatment  given the guidelines pursuant to eitf in the event that our associate incentives expense is determined to fall under the guidelines of eitf  our reported net sales would be reduced  along with a corresponding reduction in reported operating expense  which would consequently have no effect on our earning from operations or net earnings 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor  and overhead 
a reserve for inventory obsolescence or unmarketable inventory is maintained and is based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
to estimate the reserve  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning  and market conditions 
a change in any of these variables could result in additional reserves 
tax valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the probability of realizing the future benefits of any net deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance for a portion or all of the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such portion  or all of such deferred tax assets  may not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance totaling  as of january   for the deferred tax asset related to the foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the foreign tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts over one to three years 
realization of the foreign tax credit carryforwards are dependent on generating sufficient foreign taxable income with related low foreign taxes and high federal income taxes prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
we believe it is more likely than not that the gross carrying value of the foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our foreign operations 
net sales  earnings from operations  and net earnings are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
consolidated net sales outside the united states represented   and of net sales in   and  respectively 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  with all revenue and expenses being translated at weighted average exchange rates for reported periods 
consequently  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we seek to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into forward and option contracts to hedge expected net cash flows from our foreign affiliates  which is primarily represented by intercompany cash transfers 
during the fiscal year ended january   we entered into forward and option contracts to offset exposure to the canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  and new taiwan dollar 
for additional disclosure regarding outstanding foreign currency forwards and options  see note i of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as a last recourse for hedging currency risk  we may elect to adjust prices in non us markets to reflect changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered in connection with our foreign currency transactions 
following are the average exchange rates of foreign currency units to one us dollar for each of our foreign markets for the years ended   and year ended canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar hong kong dollar japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won singapore dollar the japanese yen exchange rate represents the average for the first three months of japan operations that commenced in october the new taiwan dollar exchange rate represents the average for the first three months of taiwan operations that commenced in october the korean won exchange rate represents the average for the first six months of south korea operations that commenced in july the singapore dollar exchange rate represents the average for the first two months of singapore operations that commenced in november market was not in operation during year indicated 
interest rate risks 
as of january   we had no outstanding debt and therefore  we currently have no direct exposure to interest rate risk 
it may become necessary to borrow in the future in order to meet our financing needs  as circumstances require 
in the event that it becomes necessary to finance with debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow at favorable rates 
forward looking statements and certain risks the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements regard our expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions  and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases  such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future  and the sufficiency of our existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to past reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and compete and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report  and we assume no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in these forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations include the following as a network marketing company  we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products 
we rely on non employee  independent associates to purchase  market  and sell our products 
associates are independent contractors who purchase products directly for their own use or for resale 
associates typically work at the distribution of the products on a part time basis and may and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with us 
we have a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our associates 
we undertake minimal effort to provide individual training to associates 
associates may voluntarily terminate their agreements with us at any time 
there is typically significant turnover in associates from year to year 
because of this high turnover  we must continually recruit new associates 
our net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent associates and future growth in sales volume will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new associates and improving the productivity of the associates 
our net sales are significantly affected by our success in opening new markets 
if we are unable to open new markets we would have difficulty achieving our long term objectives 
we experienced growth in revenue in due in part to the successful expansion of our operations into taiwan  south korea  and singapore 
currently  we continue to expand our operations in new markets  such as mexico 
in other markets  such as the united kingdom  we struggled to operate profitably and ultimately eliminated local operations there 
recently the government of north korea has taken actions involving its nuclear assets that have created significant political tension in the region 
there is no assurance that this situation will not adversely affect our operations in south korea or that the tensions created by the situation in north korea will not adversely affect our other operations in neighboring countries  such as japan  hong kong  and taiwan 
if the political situation in north korea adversely affects the economies or political situation in south korea or our existing markets in the region  our net sales and profits in fiscal year will be affected 
if the number or productivity of independent associates does not increase  our revenue will not increase 
to increase revenue  we must increase the number and or the productivity of our associates 
we can provide no assurances that associate numbers will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase 
we experienced a and increase in active associates during and  respectively  however  in  the number of active associates had declined significantly from previous levels 
the number of active associates may not increase and could decline in the future 
associates may terminate their services at any time  and  like most direct selling companies  we experience a high turnover among associates from year to year 
we cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of associates because we primarily rely upon existing associates to sponsor and train new associates and to motivate new and existing associates 
operating results could be adversely affected if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing associates and to attract new associates 
the violation of marketing or advertising laws by associates in connection with the sale of our products or the promotion of our compensation plan could adversely affect our business 
associates are required to sign and adhere to a written agreement and policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making certain claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products  associates may from time to time create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims  or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
these violations may result in legal action against us by regulatory agencies or state attorneys general 
legal actions against associates or others associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business  including our network marketing system 
we take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor associate activities to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of our compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
publicity resulting from these associate activities can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation  which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets 
network marketing systems  such as ours are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition  and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  our marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
our ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry  our competition  or our business generally 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of key management personnel would adversely affect our business 
our founder and chairman dr 
wentz  is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business  and our message is based in large part on the vision and reputation of dr 
wentz  which helps distinguish us from our competitors 
the loss or limitation of dr 
wentz as the lead spokesman for our mission  business and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our executive officers are primarily responsible for our day to day operations  and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers  nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
gull holdings  ltd  an entity that is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned of our outstanding common stock at january  by virtue of this stock ownership  dr 
wentz is able to exert significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and our business affairs 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  dr 
wentz and his son david wentz currently serve on the board of directors 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to these directors or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to us or to other shareholders of the company 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries 
failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in addition  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  we do not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
for example  our manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and health canada and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies or the countries in which our products are sold 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business in the future 
they could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 
as we continue to expand into foreign markets our business becomes increasingly subject to political and economic risks 
changes in these markets could adversely affect our business 
we commenced operations in australia and new zealand in february  in the united kingdom in december  and in hong kong in november in  we began limited business activity in japan and launched more formal operations there in october in october  we began business operations in taiwan 
we ceased operations in the united kingdom at the end of the first quarter of we commenced operations in south korea and singapore in july and november  respectively  and opened operations in mexico during march we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis  or that new markets will be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  other network marketing companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity  such as usana  or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified associates 
there can be no assurance that  even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries  there will be a sufficiently large population of persons inclined to participate in a network marketing system  such as ours 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our associate compensation plan across all markets in which our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
an increase in the amount of incentives paid to associates would reduce profitability 
a significant expense is the payment of incentives to associates 
these incentives include commissions  leadership bonuses  and certain awards and prizes 
from time to time we have changed our associate compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales 
for example  during the third quarter of  we introduced a broad re pricing strategy across our product lines  creating a spread between the price the associate pays for the product and the sales volume point value associated with the product 
at the same time  we changed our leadership bonus program  increasing the payout from to of total sales volume points 
in february  we introduced a broad re pricing initiative  reducing the average price of our products by approximately 
this initiative decreased the amount of incentives as a percentage of net sales 
management closely monitors the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may adjust our associate compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that these changes or future changes to the associate compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in maintaining the level of associate incentives expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  these changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated associates 
an increase in incentive payments to associates as a percentage of net sales would reduce our profitability 
we rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems 
our success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability  and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology 
our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain associate and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports  and provide customer service and technical support 
any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of a significant associate or downline organization could adversely affect our business 
we rely on the successful efforts of certain associates 
our associate compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction and the costs associated with training new associates  and other related expenses may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  the ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general business and economic conditions  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care  or weight management products generally  and other competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing associates or reduce the potential pool of new associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in numbers sufficient to sustain future growth or to maintain present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier  and more established competitors 
we face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  and other nutritional products as described in greater detail in business competition 
numerous manufacturers  associates  and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution  including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other companies 
we are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and existing associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by direct selling tends to be limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
taxation and transfer pricing considerations affect our foreign operations 
our principal domicile is the united states 
the following table summarizes sales data as a percentage of consolidated net sales and the associated effective income tax rates for each of our geographic regions sales data for the united states region includes of net consolidated sales contributed by the contract manufacturing segment region net sales tax rate united states canada australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for taxes actually paid abroad 
as our operations expand outside the united states  taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed amounts of the credits available to us  resulting in the payment of a higher overall effective tax rate on our worldwide operations 
we have adopted transfer pricing agreements with our subsidiaries to regulate intercompany transfers  which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation for product purchases  management services  and contractual obligations  such as the payment of associate incentives 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our transfer pricing practices  we could be required to pay higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 
we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing laws 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing laws  or that those laws will not be modified  which  as a result  may require changes in our operating procedures 
exchange rate fluctuations affect our foreign operations and could reduce our net sales and earnings 
over the past several years  a significant amount of our net sales have been generated outside the united states 
we intend to continue to expand our foreign operations  exposing us to risks of changes in social  political  and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations 
since a significant portion of our sales is in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for us to establish or continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which foreign competitors and we sell similar products in the same market 
as our business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that our non us financial results be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases by our foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the united states 
we enter into forward and option foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
we generally do not use derivative instruments to manage currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that hedging transactions will protect operating results and cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
those adverse effects would also adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials 
we acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
normally  materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased on account or by purchase order 
we have very few long term agreements for the supply of these materials 
there is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue selling their products to us 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
in certain situations we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source 
in addition  we rely on third party manufacturers for several of our products  including our food bars and drink mixes 
we have in the past discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials needed by us in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of these raw materials  we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions not within our control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
governmental action taken to hold or block import of our products due to the incident of bse could adversely affect our sales activity and results of operations in japan 
recently  there has been a worldwide growing concern pertaining to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse pathogen or mad cow disease 
asian countries in general are exercising caution regarding imports that contain bovine animal products that may be potentially contaminated with the bse pathogen and linked to the mad cow disease concern 
the primary concern in the nutritional supplement industry appears to be products containing gelatin capsules  which are generally derived from bovine animal product sources 
the japanese government specifically  has requested that we provide information to them regarding our source of gelatin that is used to manufacture gelatin capsuled products and  as of the first week of fiscal year  are holding all shipments with products containing gelatin until an investigation is conducted 
we are providing the requested information through our japan office that demonstrates that our gelatin source is not derived from us bovine sources linked to cows  but rather originates from bovine sources in india associated with the water buffalo 
none of our products are affected by the bse pathogen and the current restriction in japan is only on importing not selling products containing gelatin 
we believe that we have sufficient inventories in our japanese warehouse to cover current and future demand for the near term 
we further expect this regulatory issue to be resolved quickly and anticipate no significant lost sales due to the temporary hold on shipments 
there can be no assurance  however  that a delay in concluding the current investigation will not adversely affect our business in japan or that similar action in other markets will not adversely affect our results of operations 
shortages of raw materials used in certain of our products may temporarily adversely affect our margins and profitability related to the sale of those products 
many nutritional supplement companies that manufacture products containing coenzyme q coq have recently experienced a shortage in supply of this raw material component 
the sharp increase in demand for coq has caused a temporary shortage in supply of this enzyme while suppliers re tool their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity in order to meet the growing demand 
certain of our nutritional products are affected by this raw material shortage 
we believe our current supply of coq on hand is sufficient to meet both outstanding orders and forecasted production requirements for the near term 
we also believe this shortage will be a short term phenomenon and expect that the supply will return to normal levels around mid year we have identified multiple sources to supply this raw ingredient to usana and are confident that we can obtain the necessary quantities  however  it is likely that any quantities of coq acquired during this shortage will be purchased at higher prices  which would negatively impact gross margins for those products affected 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs  and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although we believe all of our products to be safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
we conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products  but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because we are highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety  and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  we could be adversely affected in the event those products should prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products or a competitor s similar products 
as a manufacturer we may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation to prosecute such claims 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  we have not been party to any product liability litigation  although certain individuals have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our nutritional products 
these matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance  which we believe to be adequate for our needs  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
most of our products are not protected by patents 
the labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and interactions among various substances 
in this respect  we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer  and more effective formulations of our nutritional or other products 
we protect our investment in research  as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products  by relying on trade secret laws  although we have not to date entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  we endeavor to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for our products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada  and many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the near future 
notwithstanding our efforts as described above  there can be no assurance that these efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
if an infringement claim is asserted  we may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis  or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our products that are alleged to have infringed 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
there can be no assurance that third party claims will not in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we manufacture approximately of the products sold by our associates 
as a result  we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in salt lake city  utah 
those operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure  or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste  and other toxic and hazardous materials 
our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations  and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities  or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained 
the trading price of the common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the price of the common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have  in certain cases  not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
we may incur liability under a recently launched athlete guarantee program  if and to the extent participating athletes make a successful claim against usana for testing positive for certain banned substances while taking usana nutritional supplements 
usana believes that its nutrition supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world class training and competitive athletic programs 
the company further believes that while its products promote good health  they are not otherwise considered to be performance enhancing as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the world anti doping agency wada 
for many years  usana has been a sponsor of olympic athletes and professional competitors around the world 
these athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking usana nutritional products 
to back up its claim that athletes who use the company s products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances  the company has offered to enter into agreements with select athletes in canada  which state that  during the term of the agreement  should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the wada  and should such positive result be the result of taking usana nutritional products  usana would compensate that athlete up to one million canadian dollars based on the athlete s personal level of competition  endorsement  and other income  as well as other factors 
to mitigate potential exposure under these agreements  we intend to designate lots identified as dedicated to the program and retain additional samples  store designated lot samples externally with a third party  and establish a chain of custody that requires signatures on behalf of usana and the third party to transfer possession of the product lots and that restricts access by usana employees after the transfer 
the program is open only to elite world class athletes in canada and all applicants are subject to screening and acceptance by the company in its sole discretion 
currently  there are applications for this program under review  however  presently no agreements have been executed 
contracts will be tailored to fit the athlete s individual circumstances and the amount of the company s exposure is limited based on the level of sponsorship of the participating athlete 
although the company believes that the pool of potential participants in the program is very small  there is no guarantee that an athlete accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against the guarantee  which would require that the company pay the athlete under the terms of its agreement with that athlete 
the company currently has no insurance to protect it from potential claims under this program
