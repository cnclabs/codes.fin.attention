we do not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or resolution of the accounting litigation proceedings  or to estimate the amounts of  or potential range of  loss with respect to those proceedings

other litigation and claims in addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to various claims  other pending and potential legal actions for product liability and other damages  investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
these include product liability litigation and other claims our subsidiary  mckesson medical surgical inc  is one of many defendants in approximately cases in which plaintiffs claim they were injured due to exposure  over many years  to latex proteins in gloves manufactured by numerous manufacturers and distributed by a number of distributors  including mckesson medical surgical inc efforts to resolve tenders of defense to its suppliers are continuing and final agreements have been reached with two major suppliers

we  along with more than other companies  have been named in a lawsuit brought in by the lemelson medical  educational research foundation the foundation alleging that we and our subsidiaries are infringing seven us patents relating to common bar code scanning technology and its use for the automated management and control of product inventory  warehousing  distribution and point of sale transactions 
due to the pendency of earlier litigation brought against the foundation by the manufacturers of bar code devices attacking the validity of the patents at issue  the court stayed the suit against us until the conclusion of the earlier case  including any appeals that may be taken 
the trial in this earlier case concluded in january and the court subsequently ruled that each of the patents at issue was invalid due to prosecutorial laches 
an appeal by the foundation to the federal circuit court of appeals is anticipated 
while the suit against the company was stayed  the us patent and trademark office granted petitions for reexamination of three of the seven patents asserted by the foundation against the company 
the reexamination will determine  among other things  whether these patents have expired

in addition  we believe that  if necessary  a portion of these claims would be covered by insurance

environmental matters primarily as a result of the operation of our former chemical businesses  which were fully divested by  we are involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations 
we have received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial action purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at six sites where we  or entities acquired by us  formerly conducted operations  and we  by administrative order or otherwise  have agreed to take certain actions at those sites  including soil and groundwater remediation 
in addition  we were recently one of multiple recipients of a new jersey department of environmental protection agency directive and a separate united states environmental protection agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages nrd associated with one of these six sites 
although the company s potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time  we have agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party prp group in the funding of an nrd assessment  the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below 
based on a determination by our environmental staff  in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel  the current estimate of reasonably possible remediation costs for these six sites is million  net of approximately million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or we expect  based either on 
table of contents mckesson corporation agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing  to be contributed by third parties 
the million is expected to be paid out between april and march of our liability for these environmental matters has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have been designated as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of as amended  the superfund law or its state law equivalent for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of our alleged disposal of hazardous substances at sites 
with respect to each of these sites  numerous other prps have similarly been designated and  while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon prps  as a practical matter costs of these sites are typically shared with other prps 
our estimated liability at those sites is approximately million 
the aggregate settlements and costs paid by us in superfund matters to date have not been significant 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include this environmental liability 
the potential costs to us related to environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and cleanup costs  the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  the timing  varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies  the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other prps  and the extent  if any  to which such costs are recoverable from insurance or other parties 
while it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any of the litigation or governmental proceedings discussed under this section ii  other litigation and claims  we believe based on current knowledge and the advice of our counsel that  except as otherwise noted  such litigation and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
iii 
contingency in  we entered into a million  ten year contract with the national health services information authority nhs  an organization of the british government charged with the responsibility of delivering healthcare in england and wales 
the contract engages the company to develop  implement and operate a human resources and payroll system at more than nhs locations 
to date  there have been delays to this contract which have caused increased costs and a decrease in the amount of time in which we can earn revenues 
these delays have adversely impacted the contract s projected profitability and no material revenue has yet been recognized on this contract 
as of march   our consolidated balance sheet includes an investment of approximately million in net assets  consisting of prepaid expenses  software and capital assets  net of cash received  related to this contract 
while we believe it is likely that we can deliver and operate an acceptable system and recover our investment in this contract  we are currently negotiating with the nhs to amend certain key terms and conditions in the contract  and there is no certainty we will agree on an updated implementation plan 
we expect this negotiation to be completed in the second half of calendar year however  the timing and the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and failure to reach agreement on an updated implementation plan and amend certain key contract terms and conditions  and or further delays in the implementation may result in losses that could be material 
even if we agree on amended contract terms and conditions and an updated implementation plan  it is possible that the terms of that agreement may result in the impairment of our net assets related to the contract as well as substantial penalties and charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements
