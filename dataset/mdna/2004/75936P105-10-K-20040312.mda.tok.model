the loss includes charges aggregating  attributable to an impairment provision by the wellsford whitehall venture and related charges during the fourth quarter of annually  after the preparation of budgets for the following year and as part of the financial statement closing process  wellsford whitehall performs evaluations for impairment on all of its real estate assets 
as part of this evaluation  wellsford whitehall recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to assets in the portfolio during the fourth quarter of the provision is not the result of a change in intended use of such assets  however  it is the result of several factors including  but not limited to  a continued deterioration of and outlook for the suburban office submarkets where wellsford whitehall s properties are situated 
specifically  these include decreasing market rents  slower absorption trends and greater tenant concession costs 
the company s share of this impairment charge was approximately  in additionally  as a result of the wellsford whitehall charge  the company wrote off the balance of unamortized warrant costs of  related to wellsford whitehall and determined that it was not appropriate to carry the balance of the net deferred tax asset attributable to net operating loss nol carryforwards and recorded a valuation allowance of  in the fourth quarter of rental revenue decreased  this decrease is due to the impact of rent concessions in excess of the period at all phases of palomino park in the wellsford development sbu  and reduced rental operations at the silver mesa phase resulting from unit sales and fewer units being rented in the period as compared to the period  offset by commenced operations at the green river phase at palomino park effective january  as such revenues in the fiscal period are in excess of the period  and increased average physical occupancy and other tenant fee increases at the blue ridge and red canyon phases at palomino park 
revenues from sales of residential units and the associated cost of sales from such units were  and  respectively  from sales during and were  and  respectively  from sales during the period 
the average pre tax income from unit sales was approximately  greater per unit than in the corresponding period as a result of sales of higher priced and larger units  a reduced commission rate on the units sold and declining interest costs included in cost of sales as the average outstanding debt balance was being reduced over the periods until its ultimate repayment in may interest revenue increased  this increase is due to the receipt of a yield maintenance penalty of  from the prepayment of the park loan at september   offset by reduced interest of  earned on loans from lower average outstanding loan balances in the period as compared to the period including  related to the loss of revenue during the fourth quarter of from the park loan  as well as reduced interest earned on cash and securities of  from the net effect of lower base interest rates and a higher average outstanding investable cash and securities balance during the current period versus the comparable period

additionally  the company s management fees for its role in the second holding investment increased  from the growth of assets under management in that venture 
fee revenue will be impacted in the future by increases in assets under management by second holding and the ability to sell assets by wellsford whitehall 
property operating and maintenance expense decreased  this decrease is primarily the result of refunds for water charges by the municipality for palomino park coupled with the company absorbing lower utility costs in because of a average physical occupancy compared to in the period and payroll reductions from a smaller property operating staff  offset in part by additional tenant replacement and advertising costs and rising insurance premiums 
the increase in real estate taxes of  is primarily attributable to higher assessments and rates in the period as compared to the period for the blue ridge  red canyon and green river phases at palomino park  offset by reduced taxes on the gold peak land from a lower assessment  and reduced taxes from the sale of silver mesa units 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  this increase is attributable to the company expensing  of unamortized warrant costs in  including the write off of the remaining  balance relating to the wellsford whitehall venture as a result of an impairment charge taken by wellsford whitehall during the fourth quarter of  whereas in the expense was  including an impairment related adjustment of  in that period  additional green river depreciation as the final sections of this phase were put in service during the period  and fixed asset additions for the other palomino park phases and corporate office assets  offset by a declining depreciation basis resulting from the transfer of silver mesa units from operations to residential units available for sale during both periods 
property management expenses decreased  such decrease is primarily due to the reduction in contractual management fees beginning october  from a annual fee of gross receipts to a annual fee for the palomino park operational phases  in addition to a decrease in net rental revenues in the period see above rental revenue discussion 
if the fee had remained at for the comparable period  the decrease would have been  less 
interest expense increased  this increase is primarily attributable to the green river phase as the period includes interest at a higher fixed rate from february on permanent financing  whereas in the period  the variable interest rate and the average outstanding balance on the construction financing were both lower than the amounts 
in addition there was a higher average base interest rate on the palomino park bonds in the period as compared to the period 
these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense from a lower average outstanding principal balance and a lower base interest rate on the silver mesa conversion loan  which was fully repaid in may  and lower average outstanding principal balances with respect to the other palomino park phases

d the increase in earnings is a result of an increase in average invested assets generating increased income for that venture in as compared to minority interest changed  from a benefit of  in the period to a benefit of  in the period  primarily attributable to a larger loss in the wellsford development sbu in as compared to the period 
income taxes changed from a benefit of  in to a provision of  in primarily from the company increasing the valuation allowance to reflect the portion of the deferred tax asset relating to the benefit of net operating loss carry forwards that the company determined would not be realizable in the next three years as a result of the significant loss reported by the wellsford whitehall venture and a loss in in which the tax benefit from an estimated carry back of losses was partially offset by minimum state and local taxes 
the change in after tax cost of the convertible trust preferred securities results from not having available any tax benefit in whereas there was a tax benefit in income from discontinued operations after taxes reflects the reclassification of the revenue and expenses from the two vlp properties in the wellsford capital sbu as a result of the change in classification to held for sale at june  the net reclassified amounts were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of one of the two properties held for sale in july comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  rental revenue increased  this increase is due to the commencement of operations effective january  at the green river phase at palomino park in the wellsford development sbu  offset by reduced rental revenue from the silver mesa phase at palomino park from unit sales  revenues from the four vlp assets earned in the period prior to their respective sales during  and decreased economic occupancy at the blue ridge and red canyon phases at palomino park 
revenues from the sale of silver mesa residential units and the associated cost of sales from such units were  and  respectively  from sales during the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  from sales during the corresponding period

property operating and maintenance expense increased  this increase is the result of i the commencement of operations at green river on january   ii increased property level payroll  insurance and significant retenanting costs at all operating phases at palomino park for silver mesa  such increases were in excess of reductions from units sold plus the cessation of capitalization of certain costs at gold peak commencing january   offset in part by expenses from the four vlp assets incurred in the period prior to their respective sales during 
the increase in real estate taxes of  is primarily due to the commencement of operations at green river  and the cessation of cost capitalization on the undeveloped gold peak land  and increased silver mesa real estate taxes for a higher tax rate from more units being assessed at a condominium value  which is higher than the assessment for a rental unit  partially offset by taxes from the four vlp assets for the period prior to their respective sales during 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  this decrease is attributable to the amortization of joint venture cost as only one property was sold by wellsford whitehall and one property was subject to an impairment adjustment during the period  causing a write off of the related unamortized warrant balances by the company  whereas eleven properties were sold in the prior year s comparable period  reduced basis from the transfer of units at silver mesa during to replenish sales inventory as units became part of sales inventory in january  units in july and units in october  and reduced depreciation in of corporate furniture  fixtures and equipment 
these decreases were offset by the commencement of depreciation on the green river rental phase  and fixed asset additions on blue ridge and red canyon 
property management expenses decreased  such decrease is due to the sale of the four vlp properties during and the assumption of certain management duties by the company in april which were previously performed by an affiliate of whitehall for the vlp properties  as well as decreased rental revenues from lower economic occupancy at blue ridge and red canyon  and silver mesa sales  partially offset by the commencement of operations at green river

interest expense increased  this increase is attributable to the cessation of interest and debt cost capitalization in at palomino park  was capitalized in the period for green river and gold peak and interest on the green river construction loan

additionally  was impacted  to a lesser extent  by the sale of properties in  lower occupancy and lower rental rates in b one property was sold in where as eleven properties were sold in c impairments in relate to two properties available for sale at december  impairments in primarily relate to the change in intended use of a development property  which was sold later in that year 
d the increase in earnings is a result of a change in the allocation of income for the partners of the venture effective january   coupled with an increase in invested assets resulting in increased income for that venture

the increase in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the wellsford whitehall impairment charge and the adjustment to the nol carryforward previously described 
the valuation allowance at december  relates to fully reserving the nol carryforwards  the impact of deferred compensation and severance arrangements and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and substantially all of the differences in the basis of the company s investment in wellsford whitehall

terrorism insurance in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of  which was enacted to help companies obtain terrorism insurance at reasonable rates 
as a result  many of the company s liability insurance carriers including the primary and excess liability carriers  have made such insurance available to the company 
the company is covered under its current policies which expire at june  and had such insurance for all of assets in the wellsford whitehall portfolio were covered under terrorism insurance policies for the year ended december  the company and wellsford whitehall expect that similar coverage will be available in connection with an all risk policy and will need to make an assessment of the cost benefit of obtaining terrorism insurance in the future

inflation declining prices substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s leases with their tenants provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units during an inflationary period 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
conversely  in a period of declining economics  short term leases pose an increasing risk to the company of reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents in conjunction with concessions to new and renewal tenants 
this is currently being experienced by the company s palomino park operating properties 
assets in the wellsford whitehall portfolio are currently subject to similar risks regarding declining economics which may result in reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents and greater concessions to new and renewal tenants 
trends the markets in which the company owns and operates its assets or has investments in entities which own and operate assets are subjected to general and local economic business conditions 
based upon the current economic environment  these conditions may negatively impact the occupancy levels  rents and the amount of concessions at properties in the wellsford development and wellsford capital sbus and the sale of residential units at silver mesa in the wellsford development sbu and fordham tower residential units in the wellsford capital sbu 
wellsford whitehall would be similarly impacted by such economic conditions in connection with leasing properties and the ability to sell properties in the portfolio 
rising insurance premium costs or availability of certain insurance coverages may negatively impact the operating results and cash flows of the company s assets and sbus 
energy costs may continue to increase as a result of the world and domestic events  also negatively impacting operating results and cash flows 
the availability and cost of other natural resources  such as the lack of water supply caused by severe drought conditions in the denver market  could negatively impact operating results and cash flows as well 
the company s sales of residential units at silver mesa have a seasonal trend where sales are generally higher in the summer and fall months than during the winter and early spring 
therefore  past quarterly results may not be indicative of the sales pace in future quarters 
the number and timing of future sales of silver mesa residential units could be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates and the availability of credit to potential buyers in  whereas during  historically low interest rates may have benefited sales results 
the sale of residential units at fordham tower could be similarly impacted by increases in interest rates
