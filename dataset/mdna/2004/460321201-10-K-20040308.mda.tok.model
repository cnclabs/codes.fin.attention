we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage including all inland moves  for which revenues and expenses are fully recognized upon completion of the mother vessel voyage 
provisions for loss voyages are recorded when contracts for the voyages are fixed and when losses become apparent for voyages in progress 
voyage revenue and expense recognition requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain foreign operations are subject to us income taxes 
we had approximately million of unused foreign deficit carryforwards as of december  the evaluation of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected future taxable income 
while we expect to be able to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards  actual future taxable income may differ from our estimates and as such we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against these assets 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for each policy year based on independent actuarial estimates  and to maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
we believe most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance provisions are adjusted to reflect our current estimate of loss exposure for the policy year 
however  if during this two year period our estimate of loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance provisions to our estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos insurance we maintain provisions for our estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we are also indemnified for certain of these claims by the previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
results of operations our vessels are operated under a variety of charters and contracts 
the nature of these arrangements is such that  without a material variation in gross voyage profits total revenues less voyage expenses and vessel and barge depreciation  the revenues and expenses attributable to a vessel deployed under one type of charter or contract can differ substantially from those attributable to the same vessel if deployed under a different type of charter or contract 
accordingly  depending on the mix of charters or contracts in place during a particular accounting period  our revenues and expenses can fluctuate substantially from one period to another even though the number of vessels deployed  the number of voyages completed  the amount of cargo carried  and the gross voyage profit derived from the vessels remain relatively constant 
as a result  fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of trends in profitability  and our management believes that gross voyage profit is a more appropriate measure of operating performance than revenues 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses variations in gross voyage profits rather than variations in revenues 
executive summary the year was an eventful and difficult year 
in march of  the president of the united states ordered the military to unseat saddam hussein 
iraqi freedom commenced that effort and was successful by may in defeating the iraqi army 
during and after these hostilities  we participated in delivery  through our vessels  of some of the military hardware needed by our forces 
we continued to meet our goal of reducing debt as in the first and second quarters of  we repurchased approximately million of our senior notes scheduled to mature in realizing a before tax gain of approximately million 
this brought our notes repurchased to date to a total of million par value leaving outstanding million par value 
our total net repayment of borrowed debt in was approximately million 
early in the third quarter of  usgenne  the charterer of our us flag coal carrier  filed a petition for bankruptcy 
even though usgenne has continued to comply with the charters terms  its bankruptcy created an event of default under the financing arrangements related to the coal carrier and required us to obtain alternate financing to immediately retire the existing debt along with a pre payment penalty and associated costs of million 
usgenne has until the second quarter of to decide whether to maintain or reject our charter as they emerge from bankruptcy 
in addition to the million impacting earnings  a further impact of approximately million of unanticipated vessel repair costs and accelerated deferred charge write offs also occurred in the third quarter 
as we entered the fourth quarter of  president bush rescinded the punitive steel tariffs that he had put in place in march of the elimination of the steel tariffs and the continuing weak dollar in relationship to most foreign currencies found international trade once again having to respond to significant events in the marketplace 
finally  the marketplace for all types of dry cargoes carried by container vessels and or dry bulk carriers of various sizes now is reacting to the economic growth in china and the reviving us economy 
we are pleased to report going into  that these markets remain firm 
as evident in the year  we will continue to have to be vigilant in approaching the immediate future with a positive but continued conservative approach 
as a result of the preceding issues  some of our segments suffered  however  overall we met our objectives 
for the twelve months ended december   we reported a net profit of million compared to a net loss of  for the year operating income for the year ended december   was million compared to operating income of million for the year our foreign flag lash liner service had disappointing results 
it was impacted by low volume both eastbound and westbound 
throughout  the trade patterns were adversely affected by the us steel tariffs and the weak dollar 
the dollar remains weak  particularly against the euro  but in spite of this  with the us economy on the rebound  we are optimistic for this service going into as the termination of the steel tariffs has brought some improvement in volume late in the fourth quarter carrying over to while our us flag lash liner service had some early year unanticipated expenses  cargo volume has held and we have seen improved performance in the second half of the year 
our three us flag ro ro vessels chartered to the msc had satisfactory results during the year 
these three vessels will continue on charter until the charter for our multi purpose vessel expired in the first quarter of and operated on a commercial voyage from the us gulf to the middle east 
the vessel was sold for a small gain during the fourth quarter of our four us flag and two foreign flag pctcs operated with improved results during the year 
also  our contract with a major mining company in indonesia produced satisfactory results carrying supplies in papua 
this contract has an additional three years to run 
although the charterer of our coal carrier filed the petition for bankruptcy  operationally we are pleased to report that the vessel was used by usgenne without interruption for the entire year  producing operating profit about equal to that which would have been obtained from employment at current market rates on alternative business 
our molten sulphur carrier operated satisfactorily during the year 
it continues on long term charter 
our rail ferry service between mobile  alabama and coatzacoalcos  mexico continues to improve 
we are pleased at the continued broadening support from our clients in both directions 
our volume continues to increase 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we sold our interest in four newly built capesize bulk carriers each about  ton total dead weight carrying capacity for about breakeven 
we simultaneously purchased a interest in each of two of the vessels 
the vessels will continue to operate in an international ship pool composed of twenty vessels owned by pool members and between to chartered vessels of similar size 
the charter market for capesize vessels firmed in the second half of and remains firm going into we own a interest in an international company owning eight specialized cement carriers and one ice strengthened bulk carrier 
all of these vessels operated satisfactorily in year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit increased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner service gross voyage loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in our us flag lash liner service s gross voyage loss improved from a loss of million in to a profit of  in primarily due to expenses  included in  associated with winding down the four vessel service  while results reflect the current one vessel operation 
as a partial offset  our foreign flag lash liner service s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in primarily due to lower cargo volume and higher than anticipated operating costs in additionally  depreciation on this segment s assets and operating lease expense increased from million in to million in due to upgrade work performed in late on one of our lash vessels 
time charter contracts this segment s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in unanticipated vessel repairs resulting from machinery deficiencies on one of our multi purpose vessels in the third quarter contributed to the decrease in gross voyage profit 
the cost of the repairs and resulting vessel downtime impacted this segment by approximately million 
additionally  vessel and barge depreciation increased resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of one of our multi purpose vessel  which was sold during the fourth quarter of partially offsetting this decrease was our coal carrier operating on time charter to usgenne  which experienced higher results due to the vessel being utilized for all but two days during under its basic time charter contract as compared to when it was out of service thirty three days for repairs and during which it operated days in the spot market at lower rates as compared to its basic charter 
contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in primarily due to higher operating costs in and from a payment received in for loss of hire from an insurance claim relating to pre existing damages identified during a scheduled drydocking 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was a result of higher cargo volume during other this segment s gross voyage profit improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in contributing to the improved results was the closing of our singapore office  which operated at a loss during  and the improved results of our insurance subsidiary  which operates solely to cover self retained insurance risks 
the results of benefited from a full year s operation of our owned car transportation truck company as well as the results of two chartered vessels that we are operating under maritime security program contracts  which only operated for half of other income and expenses gain on sale of vessels and other assets of million in primarily related to the sale of our multi purpose vessel  which completed its commitment under charter with the msc and was no longer needed for operations  and the sale of special purpose barges no longer needed for current operations 
the net gain of  in primarily related to the sale of certain contract rights that were no longer beneficial to us and the sale of certain assets no longer needed for operations 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in decreases due to lower outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates accounted for million of the total difference 
approximately million of the decrease resulted from the early repayment of our senior notes and repurchases of our senior notes  which was partially offset by the cost of new financings used to repurchase some of the notes 
investment income increased from  in to million in primarily as a result of higher dividend income received in from our investment in certain bulk carrier companies accounted for under the cost method  and interest earned on a receivable which resulted from the fourth quarter sale and leaseback of one of our foreign flag lash vessels 
this was partially offset by lower invested balances and lower interest rates earned on invested funds in the current period 
other income of million in was a result of interest collected in on foreign tax refunds 
loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from a make whole prepayment penalty and write off of deferred financing charges associated with the necessary prepayment of our coal carrier loan to cure a technical default see usgenne bankruptcy filing in liquidity and capital resources 
this was partially offset by a discount on the retirement of approximately million of our senior notes due in see note a summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f 
income taxes we had a tax provision for federal income taxes of million in and a tax benefit of  in the statutory rate was for both years 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  of  for and  for  was primarily related to our investment in companies owning and operating cement carrying vessels 
the decrease in the equity in net income of was primarily due to a write off of an uncollectable charterhire receivable by one of these companies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner service gross voyage loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in in  an impairment loss of million was recognized as a result of our plan to separate certain of our vessels from our operations and dispose of these assets 
also contributing to the improved results of this segment was an improvement of million from the elimination of the four vessel us flag lash liner service 
expenses associated with winding down the service were offset by the reduction of loss provisions for insurance and other accruals during the year which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below 
additionally  the commencement of the renewed us flag lash service in november of contributed gross voyage profit of approximately  offsetting this improvement was lower gross voyage profit from our foreign flag lash liner service of million resulting from lower rates for eastbound cargo and higher than normal towage expenses for lash barges as a result of high water on the mississippi river and higher interstate towage expenses 
additionally  in  this service experienced a drop in cargo volume as a result of lower westbound cargo volumes due to sanctions imposed by the president on steel imports 
we reduced our insurance provisions during resulting from a review of our current estimate of our loss exposure for the policy year that reached the end of its two year period as well as from a reduction in the estimated total remaining loss exposure related to the us flag lash liner service 
we determined that the provisions for this policy year  which were based on actuarial estimates  exceeded our loss exposure estimate  mainly as related to personal injury claims 
we routinely review our self retention loss provisions and makes adjustments as we believe they are warranted 
during  we reduced the estimated provision by approximately million  of which million was related to the liner services segment 
we maintain accruals for amounts due to us customs related to repair work performed on us flag ships at foreign shipyards 
us customs advised us during the second quarter of that several claims related to the us flag lash liner service would be settled and would require payment within a year 
as a result  the portion of accruals associated with our settlement estimate was reclassified from long term to current liabilities as of december  additionally in  as a result of recent settlements  we revised our estimates of amounts due to us customs  which resulted in an increase in gross voyage profit of the liner services segment of approximately million 
as a result of the discontinuation of the us flag lash liner service  we recognized expenses associated with the winding down of the service of million during time charter contracts this segment s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in in  an impairment loss of million was recognized on one of our lash vessels that was sold while held for disposal 
the decrease in gross voyage profit resulted from the sale and leaseback of two of our pctcs during the second half of  renegotiated lease terms on another pctc that resulted in different accounting treatment  and offhire time for repair work on our coal carrier 
the contracts under which the three pctcs operate were not affected by the aforementioned lease transactions 
however  because the leases now qualify for treatment as operating leases  the lease payments of million were included in voyage expenses during the resulting increase in voyage expenses approximates the depreciation and interest charges recorded on these vessels during  which were eliminated by the lease transactions 
also contributing to the decrease was the sale of our cape size bulk carrier in the decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in revenue earned by our pctcs due to carrying more supplemental cargoes during and by  related to the reduction of loss provisions for insurance and other accruals during the year discussed previously 
one of our multi purpose vessels  which is included in this segment  operated under charter to the msc re supplying scientific projects in the arctic and antarctic 
gross voyage profit associated with this contract was comparable to the prior year 
the contract with the msc was extended in december of through the first quarter of the vessel was sold during the fourth quarter of contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit decreased slightly from million in to million in the transportation contract under which our molten sulphur carrier operates was assigned by freeport mcmoran sulphur llc to gulf sulphur services ltd  llp during the second quarter of the terms of the contract were not affected by the assignment 
rail ferry service this segment s gross voyage loss of approximately million in improved from a loss of million in the improvement resulted primarily from an increase in rail cars shipped in compared with other this segment s gross voyage profit decreased from a profit of  in to a loss of million in as a result of the discontinuation of the previous four vessel us flag lash liner service  which decreased the results of certain of our specialized subsidiaries in other income and expenses administrative and general expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily due to savings resulting from staff reductions  slightly offset by related severance payments 
additionally  we retained an unrelated third party during to provide ship management services that were previously provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the costs for these services of approximately million were included in voyage expenses in while the expenses of the subsidiary were included in administrative and general expenses in gain on sale of vessels and other assets of  in primarily related to the sale of certain contract rights that were no longer beneficial to us and the sale of other assets no longer needed for operations 
the net gain of million in was related to gains on the sale of one of our pctcs  which was replaced by a newer pctc  and the sale of additional contract rights no longer required by us  partially offset by a loss on the sale of two of our lash vessels  which completed their commitment under charter with the msc and were no longer needed for operations interest expense decreased from million in to million in the early repayment of the debt associated with the two pctcs sold and leased back during under operating leases  and the reclassification of another pctc lease from a capital lease to an operating lease due to a change in lease terms accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt and lower interest rates contributed million to the decrease 
additionally  interest expense decreased because our line of credit had a lower balance drawn throughout as compared to  and we repurchased million of our senior notes and million of our senior notes during these decreases were partially offset by interest incurred during on the financing of a new pctc purchased in the second half of  additional financing on our molten sulphur carrier in july of  and new financing on two of our lash vessels in november of other income of million in resulted from interest earned by us on overpayments of foreign taxes made in prior years that were previously refunded 
income taxes our tax benefit for federal income taxes was  in and million in the statutory rate was for both years 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  of  for and  for  was primarily related to our investment in companies owning and operating cement carrying vessels 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital increased from million at december   to million at december  of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to the current maturities of long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by cash used for investing activities of  and by financing activities of million 
operating activities generated a positive cash flow after adjusting the net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation and amortization 
cash used for investing activities of  was primarily to cover payments for vessel upgrade and purchases of non vessel related assets 
partially offsetting these additions is the sale of our multi purpose vessel  which had reached the end of its economic life and special purpose barges  which had been held for disposal 
additionally  in  we sold our investment in four cape size bulk carriers and simultaneously reinvested in two of these vessels at a level 
cash used for financing activities of million included million used to repurchase million of our senior notes at a discount  million used for regularly scheduled payments of debt  million used for prepayment of the coal carrier loan see usgenne bankruptcy filing section below  million for an additional payment on our sulphur carrier loan  million used for prepayments of outstanding debt obligations on three of our vessels that were consolidated into one loan  and million used to repay draws on our line of credit 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds of million from draws on our line of credit  the financing of million used for the prepayment of the aforementioned coal carrier loan  and million in secured financing used for the prepayment and consolidation of the aforementioned debt on three of our vessels 
at december   million was available on our million revolving credit facility  which expires in april of debt and lease obligations we have several vessels under operating leases  including three pctcs  one lash vessel  one ice strengthened breakbulk multi purpose vessel  a container vessel and a tanker vessel 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities and use certain transportation and other equipment under operating leases 
our obligations associated with these leases are disclosed in the table below 
the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our outstanding debt and lease obligations as of december  debt and lease obligations s thereafter long term debt including current maturities       operating leases       total by period       debt covenant compliance status we have met all of the financial covenants under our various debt agreements  the most restrictive of which include the working capital  leverage ratio  minimum net worth  and interest coverage ratio  among others  after these were amended for the full year we also met  as of december   the more restrictive financial covenants that became effective in  and believe we will continue to meet them throughout  although we can give no assurance to that effect 
if our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations or if we are unable to meet covenant requirements  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into additional financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
mexican service results we expect the results of the mexican service to continue to improve and contribute to our cash flows 
if market conditions adversely impact those projections  we believe we could find alternative placement for the two vessels supporting the service 
usgenne bankruptcy filing as previously discussed  we charter our coal carrier to usgenne  an indirect subsidiary of pg e 
on july   usgenne filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and subsequently requested an extension of time to submit its bankruptcy plan until march   and an extension until may   to solicit acceptance to its plan 
upon the acquisition of our vessel  we had issued million in notes  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the time of the bankruptcy filing 
although the notes were non recourse to the company  the indenture under which they were issued provided that usgenne s bankruptcy filing was an event of default on the notes as well as a cross default on certain of our other credit facilities 
we secured alternative financing  which was used to pay the notes in full in addition to a make whole prepayment penalty 
the payment of the notes cured the cross defaults under the other credit facilities 
therefore  we are no longer in default under any of our credit facilities 
dividend payments as a result of the impairment loss recognized on certain of our assets during  and its impact on certain financial covenants under our debt agreements  the suspension of quarterly dividend payments on our common shares of stock remains in effect 
environmental issues we have not been notified that we are a potentially responsible party in connection with any environmental matters

we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and reclassified gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt reported in prior period income statements  as those amounts no longer qualify for extraordinary treatment under sfas no 
we reported losses related to the early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  and gains of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no

in january of  the fasb issued financial accounting series interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity  which the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for those variable interest entities created after january  on december   the fasb issued a revision to fin  which among other things deferred the effective date for certain variable interests 
application is required for interests in special purpose entities in the period ending after december  and application is required for all other types of variable interest entities in the period ending after march  we do not believe that we have a significant interest in a variable interest entity  however  we are still evaluating the effect of adoption of fin in may of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires an issuer to classify the following instruments as liabilities a a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that is mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring its assets at a specified date or upon an event that is certain to occur  b a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  or is indexed to such an obligation  and that requires the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets  and c a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except with respect to certain instruments for which the effective date has been deferred 
because we do not have any such instruments outstanding  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in september of  the securities and exchange commission approved a statement of position sop on accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment 
the sop is expected to be presented for fasb clearance early in and may be issued as a final standard shortly thereafter 
this proposed sop provides guidance on accounting for certain costs and activities relating to property  plant  and equipment pp e and incorporates the following principles  pp e consists of one or more components  which should be recorded at cost  a pp e component should be depreciated over its expected useful life  and the costs of a replacement pp e component and the component replaced should not concurrently be recorded as assets 
costs related to pp e that are incurred during the in service stage should be charged to expense as incurred unless the costs are incurred for the acquisition or construction of additional components or the replacement of existing components 
our current policy on drydocking costs is to defer these costs and amortize them over the period between drydockings 
as of december   unamortized drydocking costs were million 
if this sop is approved as a final standard in its current form  we would have to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to expense all unamortized drydocking costs and we would expense all future drydocking costs as incurred 
the effective date of the proposed sop would be no sooner than fiscal years beginning after december  in december of  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised statement retains the disclosure requirements of the original statement and requires additional annual disclosures including information describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement dates  plan obligations  and cash flows 
in addition to expanded annual disclosures  the revised statement requires the components of net periodic benefit cost to be disclosed in interim periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements  forward exchange contracts and commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december   would be approximately million or of the carrying value 
in september of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while the arrangement is structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates 
the fair value of the agreement at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a  increase in the fair value of the liability 
foreign exchange rate risk 
we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments with varying maturities throughout the exchange rates at which these hedges were entered into did not materially differ from the exchange rates in effect at december  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates applicable to these contracts at december   is a liability of approximately commodity price risk 
during  we hedged a portion of our fuel requirements for our liner services and rail ferry service segments 
these commodity swap agreements contributed a net positive adjustment to voyage expense of million in as of december   we have no commodity swap agreements to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our liner services or rail ferry service segment 
if we had such an arrangement  it would be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices  however  it would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity
