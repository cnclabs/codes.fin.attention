item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products manufactured in abbott facilities and sold to customers under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  diagnostic testing products  nutritional and hospital products 
acquisitions  regulatory issues  and legal issues have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
in  abbott acquired the knoll pharmaceutical business from basf for billion and financed the purchase with debt 
the knoll business increased the scale of abbott s pharmaceutical business  and added significant commercial and research and development capabilities 
also  during the last three years  abbott financed with debt and cash the acquisitions of several businesses and technologies targeted to deliver sales growth 
as a result of these acquisitions  abbott recorded goodwill and intangibles of billion  net of amortization  and acquired in process research and development of billion 
a portion of abbott s diagnostic business was subject to product distribution restrictions due to a regulatory review in  and net sales and costs were impacted in this segment as a result of these restrictions 
in late  abbott was informed that it may now distribute the products that were impacted by these restrictions 
also  in  abbott settled its portion of an industry wide investigation of the enteral nutritional business for million 
abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely reflecting the acquisitions described above 
abbott has two acquisitions pending with aggregate purchase amounts of billion  which will be financed through a combination of operating cash flow  domestic commercial paper borrowings and long term debt 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott announced that it would distribute the shares of its core hospital products business  hospira  inc  to abbott shareholders in a tax free spin off 
the hospira business is comprised of a large portion of the hospital products segment and a small portion of the international segment 
annual sales of hospira are approximately billion 
subsequent to the spin off  the historical results of hospira will be presented as discontinued operations 
the distribution is expected to occur in the first half of in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the pharmaceutical products group  which includes the pharmaceutical products and international segments  abbott s penetration of the rheumatoid arthritis market will continue with the global launch of humira  abbott expects worldwide sales of humira to exceed million in pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in five therapeutic areas with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications 
abbott is also realigning its pharmaceutical manufacturing operations under a global structure to create a world class supply chain that better aligns the commercial  research and manufacturing organizations 
in the medical products group  which includes the diagnostic products  hospital products and ross products segments  the hospira spin off is projected to take place in the first half of in  the focus within the medical products group was on repositioning the various businesses for higher growth 
the focus in will be on executing the major initiatives already under way  including increasing the consumer presence of the ross nutritional business  integrating recent acquisitions  and positioning the vascular  molecular and blood glucose monitoring businesses to deliver strong sales growth 
also in  following the successful inspection of the lake county diagnostic facility  stabilization and re acceleration of sales growth in the immunoassay business is expected to be accomplished through focus on near term product launches and commercial execution 
critical accounting policies litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures  abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million 
abbott has recorded reserves of approximately million for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  as defined by sfas no 
sales rebates a large part of abbott s domestic businesses sell products to distributors who resell the products to the end customers 
abbott must provide rebates to members of buying groups who purchase from abbott s distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between abbott and the customer  or to state agencies  which administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children wic 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates charged against gross sales in amounted to approximately billion  or percent  based on gross sales of approximately billion 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating income by approximately million 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
as part of abbott s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings  abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
in the united states  abbott s income tax returns for years after are open 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs 
with the assistance of outside actuaries  abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
in and  abbott recorded minimum pension liability adjustments of million and million  respectively  because the accumulated benefit obligations for certain domestic and international defined benefit plans exceeded the market value of the plans assets 
this resulted in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million and million  net of taxes  in and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used at december  for determining the accumulated benefit obligations for defined benefit plans whose accumulated benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets was percent 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate at december  would result in an increase in the minimum pension liability adjustments and an increase in the charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott values and records 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value acquired intangible assets 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs 
during the last three years  the increase in acquired intangible assets  net of amortization  and goodwill amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets amounted to approximately million in results of operations sales the following table details the components of sales growth by segment for the last three years components of change total change price volume exchange total net sales vs

a a in  pharmaceutical products and international segment sales were favorably impacted compared to by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf 
a comparison of the product group sales by segment is as follows dollars in millions percent change percent change percent change pharmaceutical products neuroscience anti infectives diabetes metabolism n a cardiology anti viral immunology n a diagnostic products immunochemistry glucose hematology hospital products specialty injectable pharmaceuticals medication delivery systems and critical care devices hospital pharmaceuticals ross products pediatric nutritionals adult nutritionals international other pharmaceuticals anti infectives hospital products pediatric nutritionals adult nutritionals sales of new products in are estimated to be approximately million  led by the pharmaceutical products  hospital products and international segments 
sales increases in the pharmaceutical products segment for anti infectives in and cardiology for all three years represent primarily volume increases 
the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar in favorably impacted sales in the diagnostic products and international segments 
the sales increase in for pediatric nutritionals in the ross products segment was due to increased penetration of similac advance as well as incremental sales related to abbott s award of the wic contract in california 
the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf in favorably impacted the diabetes metabolism and cardiology product sales of the pharmaceutical products segment and the other pharmaceuticals product sales of the international segment for abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in note gains recorded in net sales were million in  million in and million in on december   the fda approved humira for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and in september  the european union approved humira 
us sales of humira  reported in immunology product sales  were million in  and international sales of humira were million in worldwide sales of humira are forecasted to be more than million in the expiration of licenses or patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant patent expirations and activities in the next three years are as follows 
the original us compound patent on clarithromycin expires in approximately of the us sales of clarithromycin in were made under a form covered by patents that expire after us sales of clarithromycin were million in abbott markets tricor in the us under a license agreement and patents covering tricor are being challenged by competitors 
abbott is vigorously defending the patents 
us sales of tricor were million in abbott s nda for synthroid  which is not protected by a patent  was approved by the fda in the fda is studying the conditions under which competitors may rely on abbott s nda to market a competitive product and could grant approval for such generic products at any time 
us sales of synthroid were million in operating earnings gross profit margins were percent of net sales in and compared to percent in the gross profit margin for was impacted by a charge of million for an impairment of assets and other expenses as a result of a lower sales forecast for abbokinase  partially offset by favorable product mix  resulting mainly from increased sales in the pharmaceutical products segment 
the gross profit margin for included the effects of the fda consent decree charge  restructuring charges  both as discussed below  and unfavorable product mix  partially offset by the absence of goodwill amortization in the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due primarily to increased goodwill and intangibles amortization and integration charges as a result of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf 
gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth  and the effects of inflation and competitive pricing pressures 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the ross and pharmaceutical products segments 
in addition  pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the ross products segment 
the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were favorably impacted in and by favorable product mix and unfavorably impacted in by unfavorable product mix 
in addition  the gross profit margin in for the pharmaceutical products segment was unfavorably impacted by higher costs for co promoted products and higher other manufacturing costs 
the gross profit margins for the diagnostic products segment were impacted by the effect of the consent decree for all three years  as discussed below 
under terms of a consent decree with the us government  abbott was prohibited from manufacturing certain diagnostic products for sale in the us until its lake county  ill 
manufacturing facilities were found to be in substantial conformity with the food and drug administration s fda quality system regulation 
in december of  the fda found the facilities to be in substantial conformity and abbott can start the process of manufacturing impacted products for sale in the us in connection with the consent decree  abbott recorded remediation costs and payments to the government  including a pretax charge of million in research and development expense  excluding acquired in process research and development  was billion in and billion in and  and represented percent of net sales in and compared to percent of net sales in the decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in and compared to was due  in part  to the decline in spending on phase iii clinical trials in and the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to increases of percent in and percent in in  abbott recorded in selling  general and administrative expense  a pretax charge of million related to the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation 
this charge increased selling  general and administration expenses by percent over the increases in selling  general and administrative expense  excluding the charge for the investigation  were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including accelerated spending for the launch of humira  due to its earlier than expected fda approval  as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products 
the increase in selling  general and administration in reflects the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf in increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products  international  and hospital products segments 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased in and due to a lower level of borrowings and lower interest rates 
income from tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture abbott s income from the tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture was lower in reflecting decreased sales and a higher level of selling and marketing spending and  in  reflecting the settlement of the us government s investigation of tap s marketing of lupron  as discussed in note other income expense  net other income expense  net for and includes charges of million and million  respectively  as a result of other than temporary declines in the market values of certain equity securities 
taxes on earnings the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in and percent in the effective tax rate for includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these substantially nondeductible charges for was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
the tax rate is lower than the and tax rates due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to abbott s lower pretax income in compared to and this had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate by percentage points 
the tax rate is lower than the tax rate  excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of basf and of vysis  inc in  due in part to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of tap pharmaceutical products inc abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of percent in due  in part  to the comparatively lower benefit from the domestic dividend exclusion compared to abbott s total pretax income 
acquired in process research and development relating to pending business acquisitions  as discussed below  will be tax effected at discrete tax rates 
spin off of abbott s core hospital products business in august  abbott announced a plan to create a separate publicly traded company for its existing core hospital products business

an increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to the international and pharmaceutical products segments 
restructuring plans in millions of dollars in  as discussed in note  abbott announced restructuring plans to align abbott s global manufacturing operations with its scientific focus and to achieve greater operating efficiencies in its diagnostic products and international segments

employee related costs are primarily severance pay  relocation of former basf employees and outplacement services 
the restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately  positions 
employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing  research and development  and sales and administrative related functions 
in  a restructuring charge was recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of basf 
the accrued restructuring reserve balance at december  of approximately relates primarily to employee severance obligations  which  by local laws must be paid over time 
contractual obligations in millions of dollars abbott has no material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements  no special purpose entities  nor activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business  such as assignment of product rights  with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable 
since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties  abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these obligations 
based upon past experience  the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote 
in addition  abbott periodically acquires small companies in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds 
the following table summarizes abbott s estimated contractual obligations payment due by period total and thereafter long term debt  including current maturities    operating lease obligations capitalized auto lease obligations purchase commitments   other long term liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet total     purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements

legislative issues on december   the president of the united states signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of among the provisions of the act is a provision granting a subsidy to sponsors of retirement medical plans with prescription drug coverage when the benefit is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit 
the financial accounting standards board has not issued final rules specifying how sponsors should account for this subsidy 
abbott has not estimated the expected favorable impact of the legislation on its retiree medical obligations or costs  and therefore has not reflected any effect of the legislation in the financial statements 
the final rules  when issued by the financial accounting standards board  could require companies  including abbott  to retroactively change amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
abbott s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation 
abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and state levels over the availability  method of delivery  and payment for health care products and services 
if additional legislation is enacted  it could have the effect of reducing prices  or reducing the rate of price increases  for medical products and services 
international operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future
