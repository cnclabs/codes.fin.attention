table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody s corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see forward looking statements on page and additional factors that may affect future results on page the company except where otherwise indicated  the terms moody s and the company refer to moody s corporation and its subsidiaries 
moody s is a provider of credit ratings  research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services  credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions 
moody s operates in two reportable segments moody s investors service and moody s kmv 
moody s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets  including various corporate and governmental obligations  structured finance securities and commercial paper programs  as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations 
it also publishes investor oriented credit research  including in depth research on major issuers  industry studies  special comments and credit opinion handbooks

the company operated as part of the dun bradstreet corporation old d b until september  the distribution date  when old d b separated into two publicly traded companies moody s corporation and the new d b corporation new d b 
at that time  old d b distributed to its shareholders shares of new d b stock 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
the method by which old d b distributed to its shareholders its shares of new d b stock is hereinafter referred to as the distribution 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such 
table of contents cases  the company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer 
the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years 
at december  and  deferred revenue included approximately million and million  respectively  related to such deferred monitoring fees 
moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding  and is billed subsequently when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from a marketplace and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its reviews  moody s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole  as considered appropriate 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above noted factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts  could result in allowances that are greater or less than moody s estimates 
in each of and  the company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis  requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from the dun bradstreet corporation in october these tax matters are discussed under legacy tax matters below 
since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material  and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  their resolution could have a material effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
in addition  potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 
goodwill moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
moody s goodwill balance is material million at december   and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates 
in estimating future operating results and cash flows  moody s considers internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 
table of contents the company s judgments  or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made  an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets  liabilities and obligations that moody s reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook 
discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds 
long term return on pension plan assets  based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments 
in determining such assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards  if actual results differ from the company s assumptions  such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on moody s pre tax expense in dollars in millions estimated impact on pre assumption used for tax expense in decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets stock based compensation on january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

therefore  employee stock options granted on and after january  are being expensed by the company over the option vesting period  based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is calculated based on a black scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period 

table of contents an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre tax expense in dollars in millions estimated impact on assumption used for amount of increase in pre tax expense in assumption decrease increase expected dividend yield expected share price volatility expected option holding period years year other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated distributions from non us subsidiaries  realizability of long lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody s 
operating segments prior to  the company operated in one reportable business segment ratings  which accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue

given the dominance of moody s investors service to moody s overall results  the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses  nor are they allocated to the company s business segments 
accordingly  all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody s kmv segment

there can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
indebtedness at december  and  the company had outstanding long term financing of million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at december  and million outstanding at december  the million of long term financing was secured in connection with the distribution  as that term is defined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the distribution  moody s was allocated million of debt at september  moody s funded this debt with borrowings under a million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit

the revolving credit facility the facility consists of an million year facility that expires in september and an million day facility that expires in september interest on borrowings under the year facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a premium that can range from basis points to basis points depending on the company s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization earnings coverage ratio  as defined in the related agreement 
at december   such premium was basis points 
interest on borrowings under the day facility is payable at rates that are based on libor plus a premium of basis points 
the company also pays annual facility fees  regardless of borrowing activity under the facility

if an event of default were to occur as defined in the agreements and was not remedied by the company within the stipulated timeframe  an acceleration of the notes and restrictions on the use of the facility could occur 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  moody s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

outlook moody s outlook for is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors  including interest rates  consumer spending  corporate profitability and business investment spending  and capital markets issuance activity 
there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and  if actual conditions differ from these assumptions  moody s results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below 
the company expects interest rates in the united states to rise during  with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment 
as a result  moody s expects to see lower issuance in the us corporate bond market  both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector  which posted record issuance in despite the issuance declines  revenue from new products and growth in relationship based revenue should produce modest growth in both the us corporate finance and financial institutions sectors 
the company is continuing to introduce the enhanced analysis initiative  consisting of financial reporting  off balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports  and moody s plans to cover approximately corporations and financial institutions in north america by the end of moody s also expects good growth in consumer spending in as a result  the company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset backed securitizations  together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business  will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines 
in the public finance ratings business moody s expects a revenue decline of approximately in  reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and new money borrowings 
the company expects continued strong growth in the us research business 
outside the us moody s expects to see double digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses 
the company is also projecting strong year over year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business  all producing approximately international revenue growth in ratings and research  including the effects of currency translation 
finally  moody s expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at moody s kmv 
moody s expenses for will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices  technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business 
the company will continue investment in the enhanced analysis initiative 
moody s expects its operating margin to decline about basis points in from the level achieved in due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin mkmv business 
an additional basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock based compensation 
since the company adopted expensing of stock based compensation prospectively effective january   the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four year option vesting period 
overall for  moody s expects that year over year revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digit percent range 
with the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases  the company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid to high single digit percent range on a reported basis 
reported earnings per share in included the impacts of the insurance gain  the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock based compensation discussed above 
the impact of expensing stock based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in  and is expected to be approximately to per share in compared with per share in additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently 
table of contents known to the company or that the company s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  moody s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately of moody s revenue in was derived from ratings  a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets 
moody s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in that was greater than its historical averages  principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes  the us components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment 
the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets 
therefore  the company s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance 
unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which moody s provides ratings services 
in addition  increases in interest rates  volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment  significant political or economic events  defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance  the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers  and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered 
a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on moody s business and financial results 
possible loss of market share or revenue through competition or regulation the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive 
moody s competes on the basis of a number of factors  including quality of ratings  client service  research  reputation  price  geographic scope  range of products and technological innovation 
moody s faces increasing competition from s p  fitch  dbrs  local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry 
since moody s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us  it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets 
these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions 
currently  moody s  s p  fitch  and dbrs are designated as nrsros by the sec 
on june   the sec issued a concept release regarding the credit ratings industry  wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws  if so  what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use  and  if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws  what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used elimination of the nrsro concept  retention of the nrsro concept with different regulatory oversight  or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share or revenue for moody s  or higher costs of operations 
introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive 
the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share 
competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody s 
increased pricing pressure from competitors and or customers in the credit rating  research and credit risk management markets  competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service 
moody s intends to continue providing the highest quality 
table of contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets 
however  if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors  moody s may lose market share 
possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled  experienced financial analysts and other professionals 
competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense  and moody s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives 
investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody s 
moody s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 
moody s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend  among other things  on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 
exposure to litigation related to moody s rating opinions moody s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions 
in addition  as moody s international business expands  these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 
potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated  establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings  the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected 
government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness 
in these circumstances  issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility  and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating  which may negatively affect the company 
proposed us  foreign  state and local legislation and regulations  including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the us and other countries  the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve 
recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies 
in january  the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets 
the report considered a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanes oxley act of and other issues arising from a sec initiated review of credit rating agencies 
in june the sec released a concept release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws  the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used  and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies 
in february  the european parliament adopted resolutions calling on the european commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in europe and possible registration criteria 
at present  moody s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the sec or other regulatory bodies 
implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators under the european commission s market abuse directive are applicable to all participants in the european capital markets 
credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines 
however  depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers  such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some european union countries 
if so  the guidelines could  among other things  alter rating agencies communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process  and increase moody s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business 

table of contents multinational operations moody s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody s to a number of legal  economic and regulatory risks such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either moody s operations or its customers use of ratings possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  travel  cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company  any of these factors could have such an effect in the future 
contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters  based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability  if any 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  subject to the contingencies described below 
discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to old d b  its predecessors and their affiliated companies legacy contingencies and those that relate to moody s business and operations moody s matters 
legacy contingencies to understand the company s exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between moody s and new d b  and the relationship among new d b and its predecessors and other parties who  through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution

in september  the dun bradstreet corporation old d b through a spin off separated into two separate public companies new d b and moody s  as further described in note  description of business and basis of presentation 
information resources  inc in july  information resources  inc iri filed a complaint in the u 
s 
district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun bradstreet corporation  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the dun bradstreet corporation 
the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections and of the sherman act 
the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited srg 
iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement 
iri s antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri s ability to compete within the us and foreign markets in north america  latin america  asia  europe and australia new zealand through a series of anti competitive practices  including unlawfully tying bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri  entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data  predatory pricing  acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri s efforts to expand  disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients  and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete 
iri s complaint originally alleged damages in excess of million  which iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws 
iri has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed million  which iri also asked to be trebled 
iri also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount 
in april  the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of iri s claims and granted in part a motion by iri seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the court had previously made in favor of the defendants 
in december of  iri was acquired by the gingko acquisition corporation  an affiliate of symphony technology ii a 
l 
p 
and certain other parties 
as part of that transaction  a statutory trust called the information resources  inc litigation contingent payment rights trust the trust was formed 
the trust was created  in part  to issue contingent value rights certificates cvrs  which represent an interest in the iri lawsuit 
the cvrs are governed by a contingent value rights agreement among iri and the acquirers  and are a tradeable security listed on the otc bulletin board 
as part of the purchase consideration  each iri stockholder received one cvr for each share of iri common stock owned  entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the iri lawsuit  if any  allocated to the trust 
the trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to of any proceeds from the iri lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than million and of any such proceeds in excess of million 
the remaining proceeds  if any  will be the property of iri 
a body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the iri litigation on behalf of iri and cvr holders 
gingko corporation named two of the rights agents  iri named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth independent rights agent 
under the contingent value rights agreement  a majority of the rights agents other than the independent rights agent must approve any settlement of the iri lawsuit 
the information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by gingko acquisition corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the trust in connection with the acquisition of iri 
in connection with the distribution  nmr then known as cognizant corporation  acnielsen and donnelley then known as the dun bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the indemnity and joint defense 
table of contents agreement  pursuant to which they agreed to allocate potential liabilities that may relate to  arise out of or result from the iri lawsuit iri liabilities  and conduct a joint defense of such action 
in particular  the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen will assume exclusive liability for iri liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the indemnity and joint defense agreement the acn maximum amount  and donnelley and nmr will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the acn maximum amount 
as noted above  acnielsen is responsible for the iri liabilities up to the acn maximum amount 
the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment  if any  in iri s favor the acn payment 
the acn payment could be less than the acn maximum amount 
the indemnity and joint defense agreement also provides for each of donnelley and nmr to pay iri of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the acn payment  and for acnielsen to issue a secured note the acn note  subject to certain limits  to each of donnelley and nmr for the amount of their payment 
the principal amount of each acn note issued to donnelley and nmr  however  is limited to of the difference between the acn maximum amount and the acn payment  and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize acnielsen s claims paying ability 
the acn notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan 
the indemnity and joint defense agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment  then nmr and donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal  and each shall pay of the costs of such bond  if any  which cost will be added to iri liabilities 
under the terms of the distribution  moody s would be responsible for of the total costs of any bond 
the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims paying ability of acnielsen without impairing the investment banking firm s ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval  and payment of interest on the acn notes and related fees and expenses 
for these purposes  viability means the ability of acnielsen  after giving effect to such recapitalization plan  the payment of interest on the acn notes  the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the acn maximum amount  to pay its debts as they become due  and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business  as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan  for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented 
in  acnielsen was acquired by vnu nv vnu nv assumed acnielsen s liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement  and pursuant to the indemnity and joint defense agreement  vnu nv is to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount 
in connection with the distribution  old d b and donnelley then known as the dun bradstreet corporation entered into an agreement the distribution agreement whereby old d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities 
under the terms of the distribution  new d b undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s for old d b s obligations to donnelley under the distribution agreement  including any liabilities arising under the indemnity and joint defense agreement  and arising from the iri action itself 
however  as between new d b and moody s  it was agreed that under the distribution  each of new d b and moody s will be responsible for of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of donnelley with respect to the iri action under the terms of the distribution agreement  including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 

table of contents as a result  the company will be responsible for the payment of of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the acn maximum amount as adjusted to include vnu nv new d b will be responsible for the payment of an additional together constituting donnelley s liability under the indemnity and joint defense agreement for of such amount and nmr will be responsible for payment of the remaining of liability in excess of the acn maximum amount 
in addition  each of the above parties  in accordance with the foregoing percentages  may be required to advance a portion of the amount  if any  by which the acn maximum amount exceeds the amount of the acn payment 
however  because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the indemnity and joint defense agreement are based on contractual relationships  the failure of a party to the indemnity and joint defense agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the iri liabilities 
as a result of their separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement  ims health and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing  and although the court earlier set a trial date for september  the court rescinded that date in january and there is currently no trial date set 
moody s is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the iri action or the financial condition of acnielsen and vnu nv at the time of any such outcome and hence the company cannot estimate the amount of the acn payment  the acn maximum amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by vnu nv and acnielsen under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
therefore  moody s is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accordingly  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements 
if  however  iri were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if moody s is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment  the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
legacy tax matters old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
pursuant to a series of agreements  as between themselves  ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and new d b and moody s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half  of any payments for taxes  penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters excluding the matter described below as amortization expense deductions for which new d b and moody s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities after new d b and or moody s pays the first million  which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as utilization of capital losses 
in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have  between themselves  agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  three specific tax matters are discussed below

as of december   moody s had reserves of approximately million with respect to such matters  which reflected an increase of approximately million during the fourth quarter of relating to the amortization expense deductions matter 
although the matter had previously been under audit  the company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the notices of proposed adjustment during the fourth quarter of reflected a formalization by the irs of its position on the matter 
it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash

such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in may concerning utilization of capital losses
