the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k  item selected financial data and part i  item business 
overview via is a provider of internet protocol ip based business communication solutions to small and medium sized enterprises  or smes  in europe and the united states 
our mission is to be recognized as an expert provider of ip based business communications solutions for smes 
we deliver internet products and services that enhance the productivity of our customers  including web hosting  internet access through dial up  dsl  or isdn and leased line connectivity  virtual private networks vpns  and internet and network security services 
because we also offer a voice communications product  we are able to serve our customers as the single source for all of their communications requirements 
we have operations in france  germany  italy  the netherlands  portugal  spain  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
our immediate goal is to generate recurring and positive cash flows on a consolidated basis 
in previous reports  we have stated our target of reaching positive recurring cash flows by the end of although the first year of implementation of our strategic plan for has yielded significant improvements in our operations  resulting in improvements in sales productivity  the rate of revenue growth we were expecting beginning late was lower than anticipated due to a number of factors  including unanticipated higher price erosion in some of our service offerings and the slowness of certain of our operations closing new product sales opportunities 
as a result of this impact on revenue growth  we now expect that our point of reaching positive cash flows from our current consolidated operations will be delayed at least until the second quarter this is dependent upon the achievement of new and incremental revenues  which we anticipate generating from our new sales and product strategy 
to reach our goal of generating positive  recurring cash flow we must  among other things  grow our revenue base substantially 
we plan to achieve our goal by shifting the focus of our business model from providing primarily lower margin dial up and leased line internet access services to offering higher margin web hosting and internet security services that we can deliver on our own product platforms  improving the efficiency of our sales efforts by re organizing our sales operations into two channels via express  which is designed to sell lower margin products and services by steering customers to our telephone based sales and internet stores  and industry solutions  which is designed to market and sell a higher value portfolio of bundled services through the efforts of our direct sales force professionals  actively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships that would complement or enhance our infrastructure  product offerings  channel strategies or customer base and that will allow us to leverage our recently improved operational capabilities to realize higher margins from acquired revenue  and continuing to improve operational performance 
the product and sales channel shift we are executing in is a result of our periodic assessment of the economics of our industry and the positioning of our business strategy in our market 
during the fourth quarter of  management evaluated the revenue achievement and future prospects of our operations and concluded that our core business  reselling internet access services on a stand alone basis  has been severely and negatively impacted by an acceleration of availability of and customer preference for low cost high bandwidth services 
as further described below under valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  management has therefore written down the value of the goodwill related to the uk  netherlands  germany  switzerland  spain  france and the us by million 
for more information on this product and sales channel shift see strategy shifting the focus of our business model and focus on developing more cost effective and productive sales under part i  business  of this form k 
there are significant risks and dependencies inherent in our ability to execute on our plan 
these risks and dependencies  as well as other risks that pertain generally to our business are described above under risk factors in item discontinued operations during  we sold our operations in argentina  austria  brazil  ireland and mexico 
in july via net 
works italia  which has been included in the european segment was sold for nominal consideration to the then current management team 
the operation in argentina was sold on june  to an unrelated third party purchaser 
the austrian operation was sold to the then current management team on may  the irish operation was sold on august  to a former shareholder and managing director of the irish operation 
each of these operations has been treated as a discontinued operation since the date of its disposition in via also sold its operations in brazil and mexico in  but because of the method by which these transactions were structured  these operations were not treated as discontinued operations in but rather classified as businesses transferred under contractual agreements 
the company has eliminated all continuing involvement in these operations in and both are now treated as discounted operations for all periods presented 
as each of the argentine  austrian  irish  italian  brazilian and mexican operations represented a component of an entity as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company has classified each operation as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
revenues related to discontinued operations were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss from discontinued operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
strategic acquisitions in january  we purchased of the issued and outstanding shares of amen sas  amen srl and amen limited collectively amen  a group of european web hosting companies based in paris  france 
amen has operations in france  the united kingdom  spain and italy 
we acquired amen to strengthen our europe segment and benefit from amen s operating platform and service offerings 
for this acquisition  we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock  at a price of  for a total value of approximately million 
the selling shareholders will have the opportunity to receive further consideration that we expect will be between million in cash and our common stock  based on the operating performance of amen 
information related to our operational opportunities as a result of this acquisition as well as other details and risks associated with the amen business is described above throughout item as discussed above  we are actively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships to complement or enhance our infrastructure  product offerings  channel strategies or customer base and to allow us to leverage our recently improved operational capabilities to realize higher margins from acquired revenue 
we do not know whether we will be successful in identifying appropriate opportunities and  if we are successful  we cannot assure that such acquisitions or partnerships will be executed and integrated efficiently 
our strategic plan calls for us to be flexible and opportunistic in effecting acquisitions and as a result  if we find one or more opportunities we believe are very attractive  we may decide to spend a substantial portion of our available cash to finance our acquisition of them 
reportable segment financial information our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and include the results from continuing operations of the wholly or majority owned operating companies that we owned for all or a portion of the respective periods 
in  we managed our business by geographic regions  namely the americas and europe  and we evaluated performance based on revenues and operating loss from continuing operations 
certain prior year data has been reclassified to conform to the current regional groupings

the decrease in the operating loss from continuing operations for the same period is primarily attributable to the reported increase in revenue and a decrease in operating costs and expenses 
the decrease in the operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  is primarily attributable to the decrease in the impairment and restructuring charges and the decrease in depreciation and amortization 
see results of operations in this section  for further analysis of revenues and impairment and restructuring charges 
americas total revenue has remained consistent from the year ended december  to december  the increase in operating loss from continuing operations and the impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  relates to a goodwill impairment in total revenue in the year ended december  was consistent with the year ended december  the operating loss from continuing operations and the impairment and restructuring charges for the year ended december  relates to a goodwill impairment in see item  management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations for a discussion of the impairment and restructuring charges

the decrease in the loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  is primarily due to reduced impairment and restructuring charges 
see item  management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations for further analysis 
as described above under item  we are reorganizing our sales operations into two channels via express and industry solutions 
as the channels further develop over  we anticipate that we will begin to manage our operations around these channels and will adapt our segment reporting accordingly 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows recognition of revenue  estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
recognition of revenue we derive our revenue from the sale of internet related goods and services  specifically third party hardware and software and internet connectivity services  other internet value added services  such as hosting  security and ip vpn  and voice services 
as described below  management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences might result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  primarily with respect to our collectibility assessment 
for revenue transactions we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of internet goods and services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash  provided other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
our practices regarding the evidence of an arrangement vary from country to country 
generally  for sales  other than those completed over the internet  we use either a purchase order or a customer agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we generally use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
our internet connectivity services  other internet value added services  and voice revenue are recognized as it is earned over the term of the customer relationship 
when our services are bundled in a customer sale agreement  the aggregate fee is allocated to the elements of the arrangement based on objective evidence of fair value such as internal price lists for stand alone products and services and competitors prices for similar products and services 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the related services are rendered  although such amounts have not been material 
the typical service period for connectivity services is from one to two years 
when the customer arrangement dictates that payments are made prior to service delivery  we record the advance receipt of payment as a credit to the balance sheet within the deferred revenue account 
the fees we receive are non refundable 
there are no terms in the agreement with the customer that allows them to cancel or terminate the agreement and obtain refunds of the amounts advanced 
as the service is provided we recognize the revenue ratably over the expected customer relationship in accordance with the revenue recognition policies described above 
when a customer pays a non refundable fee in advance and subsequently cancels service before the end of the contract term  we recognize the remaining deferred revenue as revenue with the statement of operations at the time the service is terminated 
in accordance with eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  revenue from hardware and third party software sales is recognized gross upon delivery or installation of the products  depending on the terms of the arrangement  provided other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
our hardware and software sales are arrangements negotiated and agreed upon directly with our customers 
we do not act as an agent or a broker for the vendors nor do we receive compensation  commissions or fees from the vendors 
we also maintain the freedom and discretion in selecting the appropriate vendor to support its various hardware and software arrangements 
estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables and the amount of our accrued telecommunications and restructuring costs 
management considers current economic trends  historical bad debts  accuracy of billing data  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment patterns when analyzing specific accounts receivable balances to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at least quarterly  our management performs a detailed review of the accounts receivable balance to ensure that our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts 
this assessment has a material effect on the financial statements of the company 
at december   accounts receivables totaled million are of allowances of million december  million and million respectively 
amounts released from our allowance for doubtful accounts to the statement of operations for continuing operations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  as stated above  management estimates the amount of telecommunications expense to accrue in each reporting period 
we pay other network providers for transit  which allows us to transmit our customers information to or from the internet over their networks 
we also pay other recurring telecommunications costs  including the cost of the local telephone lines our leased line customers use to reach our points of presence  or pops and access our services 
as network providers often bill on a semi annual or longer basis and such invoices have historically been subject to dispute when received  management must make estimates of the total amount due to each provider at the end of each reporting period based on internal documentation and historical trends 
to date our estimates have not materially differed from amounts ultimately due 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value of the investment in our operations to determine if an event has occurred  with respect to any operation  which could result in an impairment of long lived assets 
in its review  management considers the following market and competitive factors  including trends within the telecommunications industry broadly and the market for our products and services generally and internet access specifically  as well as general economic trends  operating and financial trends  including significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected operating results  and business outlook for each operation  including changes in the expected revenues and cash flows for each of our operations  changes in our customers and the services that they require and our future plans for each business 
long lived assets the carrying amounts of acquired intangible assets principally customer lists and tangible long lived assets are reviewed if facts or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates the carrying amounts of long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the acquired assets  the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are reduced to their estimated fair value under sfas in the first quarter of  an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in restructuring charges in respect of the fixtures and fittings of the former headquarters office in reston 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill on january   upon the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
we elected december as our annual impairment review date for all reporting units 
at december   upon completion of its annual review  the company impaired million of the goodwill related to the uk  netherlands  germany  switzerland  spain  france and the us the triggering event for the impairment was revenue under performance against forecast for of these operations and the consequential adjustment to future revenue estimates 
the fair value calculated as of december  was based on a discounted cash flow model with appropriate market and business risk factored in 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit was based on forecasts for to  and constant annual growth rates thereafter 
as a part of the process of creating the forecasts  the company s management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of future revenues  costs and cash flows 
upon completion of our annual review  we impaired million of the goodwill related to our united kingdom operation 
the triggering event for the impairment was future revenue and cost estimates based on our strategic plan as discussed in part i of this form k 
the fair value of reporting units is calculated by management based on a discounted cash flow model with appropriate market and business risk factored in 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit was based on the financial forecasts relating to the strategic plan for a three year period and constant annual growth rates thereafter 
the process of generating our strategic plan required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of future revenues  costs and cash flows 
the use of a discounted cash flow model requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the discount factor  timing of cash flows  terminal values and future growth rates 
no adjustments have been made to the fair value of net assets or the recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill 
changes to these assumptions can have a material impact on the discounted cash flows and the outcome of the impairment review 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
if  for example  the company fails to achieve the benefits it assumes will be achieved in its strategic plan  as reflected in the discounted cash flow model  further impairment may arise 
the total goodwill balance remaining at december  and december  was and million  respectively

results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  foreign currency impact foreign exchange rates can vary significantly and impact our results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
as a percentage of consolidated revenues  we had operations conducting business in the following underlying currencies twelve months ended december  december  euro great british pounds swiss francs us dollars the euro varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during and by approximately in the british pound varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during and by approximately in these exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our reported results of operations  including revenue  expenses and net loss 
the average euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate for was higher than the average euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate for the average british pound to us dollar foreign exchange rate for was higher than the average british pound to us dollar foreign exchange rate for in the period since january  the dollar has declined in value as compared to the currencies in which we conduct most of our business 
the effect of the weakening of the us dollar is that revenues  operating costs and expenses and operating profits and losses in operations with a functional currency other than us dollars translate into larger us dollar amounts than would have been the case had foreign exchange rates remained unchanged 
revenue twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of dollars revenue   revenue for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the average euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate and british pound to us dollar foreign exchange rate for the year ended december  have strengthened by approximately and respectively when compared to the same period last year positively impacting revenues during by approximately million 
on a year over year comparison  the foreign exchange rate positive impact in largely offset the decrease in underlying revenue from to  notably in germany  the uk and france 
german revenues  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  reflect a decrease approximately million from to this revenue reduction is primarily a result of actions undertaken in the fourth quarter of to eliminate certain unprofitable business in order to reduce operating losses 
uk revenues  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  reflect an decrease approximately million 
this revenue reduction is primarily the result of increased competition and price erosion 
french revenues  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  reflect a decrease approximately million 
this revenue reduction is primarily a result of increased competition  price erosion and fewer hardware and software sales 
throughout  via has taken significant actions in implementing its strategic plan  including replacing many of its direct sales professionals and sales managers with higher caliber professionals 
we have continued to rationalize our product portfolio and are actively recruiting resellers and other value added partners 
as expected  these and other back office systems and financial services outsourcing initiatives we have undertaken through the implementation of our strategic plan  have had a short term adverse effect on our revenues 
as a result of our continuous assessment of our operating results and prospected future revenues  by the end of the fourth quarter  management concluded that increased competition and price erosion would significantly impact our future ability to grow our core business of selling internet access services  particularly through our labor intensive sales channels 
as a result  we have begun a strategic shift of our sales and channel focus toward web hosting and internet security services to be sold through our new via express channel 
this shift is intended to increase our opportunities for profitable revenue growth 
in prior reporting periods  we provided information on categories of revenues that we generate 
because of the systemic errors and limitations we experienced in and with our legacy billing platforms in and  we are not currently able to provide an accurate breakdown of our revenues 
we anticipate that when we have completed the implementation of our new billing platform  we will begin again to report certain revenue categories 
the majority of our revenue is derived from internet access services 
operating costs and expenses internet services twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars internet services   of total revenue our internet services operating costs are the costs we incur to carry customer traffic to and over the internet 
we lease lines that connect our pops  either to our own network or to other network providers 
we pay other network providers for transit  which allows us to transmit our customers information to or from the internet over their networks 
we also pay other recurring telecommunications costs and personnel costs  including the cost of the local telephone lines our customers use to reach our pops and access our services  and costs related to customer support and care 
our internet services operating costs were million or of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  despite the adverse impact of the strengthening euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange rate  internet services costs have fallen for the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily due to the full period benefit of the renegotiation of network access costs in mid made possible by decreasing market rates for network bandwidth 
total internet service costs for the year ended december  also benefited from the release of telecommunication cost accruals in respect of disputed charges and line cancellation credits in two operations in the european reporting segment of million in december and million in june 
these credits are not expected to reoccur in future years 
management considers the likelihood that via will ultimately be required to pay these amounts as remote 
the release in december was made upon successful resolution of a legal claim 
selling  general and administrative twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars selling  general administrative costs   of total revenue our largest selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are compensation costs  the costs associated with marketing our products and services  and professional fees paid to outside consultants 
compensation costs include salaries and related benefits  commissions  bonuses and costs associated with staff reductions in the normal course of business 
in many of our markets  we are required to make significant mandatory payments for government sponsored social welfare programs and we have little control over these costs 
our marketing expenses include the costs of direct mail and other mass marketing programs  advertising  customer communications  trade show participation  web site management and other promotional costs 
other sg a expenses include the costs of travel  rent  utilities  insurance and bad debt expense 
we incurred sg a expenses of million for the year ended december   a decrease from the million we incurred for the year ended december  we achieved this cost reduction despite the adverse effect of the strengthening euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate  and the adverse change in bad debt expense between the periods 
the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates has adversely impacted sg a for the year ended december  over the year ended december  by approximately million 
the cost reduction is principally due to a decrease in compensation expense and professional fees 
compensation expense  which accounted for approximately and of total sg a costs for the years ended december  and respectively  reduced by approximately excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from last year primarily due to the headcount reductions during in addition  sg a expenses for the year ended december  included a bad debt expense of million 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  were benefited by a release from our bad debt provision of million 
the release in was due to billing system and process improvements made during  combined with our intensified focus on cash collection  which resulted in the collection of accounts receivable previously provided against 
for  we anticipate that our planned shift of product and channel focus to our via express products and sales channel and away from our direct sales force will result in further headcount reductions and lower recurring compensation expenses  after termination costs are paid 
we anticipate that the resulting cost savings will be partially offset by increased marketing expenditures associated with our shift toward the via express suite of services 
professional fees  related to legal  audit and other consulting fees  accounted for approximately and of total sg a for the years ended december  and respectively 
the decrease from last year is primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees 
our sg a expenses include the amortization of deferred compensation 
in march  we recorded forfeitures of unvested stock options in the amount of million  which reduced the deferred compensation balance to zero with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid in capital 
as a result  we did not record any deferred compensation expense in year ended december  the deferred compensation amortization for the year ended december  was million 
impairment and restructuring charges twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars impairment and restructuring charges   of total revenue during  management concluded that an impairment of our goodwill had occurred in our europe and americas segments 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill in the united kingdom  netherlands  france  germany  spain  switzerland and the us in addition  the company recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million for fixed asset fixtures and fittings that were written down to net realizable value as a result of the closure of the reston office in march also during  the company recorded restructuring charges related to the implementation of its strategic plan of million 
this related to severance payments at six of our european operations  at our us operation and at the corporate headquarters  the cost of vacant office space and transition implementation costs for back office and administrative outsourcing initiatives 
during  management concluded that an impairment of our goodwill had occurred 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill at our united kingdom operation 
as a part of our focus on europe as our core operating region  we moved our principal headquarter functions from reston  virginia to europe 
in conjunction with this relocation  we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the third quarter of additionally  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to severance and other payments made at our spanish operation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
depreciation and amortization twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars depreciation and amortization   of total revenue we recognize depreciation expense primarily related to telecommunications equipment  computers and network infrastructure 
we depreciate telecommunications equipment and computers over their useful lives  ranging from three to five years 
the cost of network infrastructure  net of impairment charges  purchased under indefeasible right of use agreements  or irus  is being amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life or term of the agreement  to years 
our depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   million related to the depreciation of fixed assets and million related to the amortization of intangible assets 
for the year ended december   million or of our depreciation and amortization expense was related to the depreciation of fixed assets and million  or  was related to amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in total depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a lower depreciable asset base due to asset impairments in and the first quarter of and to the fact that intangible assets had been fully amortized by the end of interest income  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars interest income  net   of total revenue for the year ended december   we earned million in interest income  compared to million we earned for the year ended december  interest income was generated from investing funds received from our initial public offering in february  until those funds were used for acquisitions  operating expenses or capital expenditures 
net proceeds from the public offering were million 
the decrease in interest income is the combined result of the decrease in the available cash for investing and the decrease in interest rates 
we also incurred  of interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to million of interest expense incurred in the year ended december  interest expense relates to vendor financing at both the subsidiary and corporate levels 
other expense  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars other expense  net of total revenue for the year ended december   we incurred other expense  net in the amount of million related mainly to losses on equipment disposals 
for the year ended december   we incurred other expense  net of million  which includes a million loss resulting from a loan made to a related party in the first quarter foreign currency gains  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars foreign currency gains  net   of total revenue we recognized a million foreign currency gain for the year ended december   as compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  the change from period to period was primarily due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate of the euro and british pound as compared to the us dollar and its impact on the revaluation of our euro and british pound denominated intercompany balances held by the parent company and on our euro denominated cash accounts 
see the foreign currency exchange risks section below for more information 
we established the euro denominated cash accounts in connection with our initial public offering in february  in which we sold shares of our common stock for both us dollars and euros 
to minimize our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash balances held in  via purchased million worth of us dollars on march   thus substantially reducing the balance in the euro cash account 
at december   the parent company maintained a euro cash reserve of million 
income tax benefit expense twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars income tax benefit expense of total revenue during the year ended december  via incurred million of tax expense principally due to withholding tax on intercompany interest paid by the portugal operation 
the effective tax rate for the company is 
this is primarily caused by net operating losses for the current year and prior years arising in the us and international subsidiaries 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  foreign currency impact foreign exchange rates can vary significantly and impact our results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
as a percentage of consolidated revenues we had operations conducting business in the following underlying currencies twelve months ended december  december  euro great british pounds swiss francs us dollars the euro varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during and by approximately in the british pound varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during and by approximately in these exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our results of operations  including revenue  expenses and net loss

swiss revenues  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  increased by approximately over levels as a result of a customer list purchased during the second quarter of german revenues  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  reflected a decrease approximately million over the same period 
this revenue reduction was primarily a result of actions undertaken in the fourth quarter of to eliminate certain unprofitable business in order to reduce operating losses

compensation expense  which accounted for approximately and of total sg a costs for the years ended december  and respectively  reduced by approximately excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates from to due to headcount reductions from at december  to at december  in conjunction with our cost cutting measures  marketing and sales expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in this total of million was approximately  related to a customer list purchased at our switzerland operation during as there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future recoverability of the asset  the entire purchase price was expensed in the period incurred 
professional fees decreased from million in to million in the costs in were primarily due to the implementation of new financial systems and our development of an integrated billing  provisioning and back office system  or the integrated platform 
as part of cost cutting measures  we suspended the development and deployment of the integrated platform during the first quarter of the costs in were primarily due to accounting fees and fees charged by outside vendors in connection with data validation projects 
as a result of the issues arising from the legacy billing systems and business processes  substantial reserves had been previously recorded against the carrying value of receivables 
in  bad debt expense was million 
the billing system and process improvements made during  combined with our intensified focus on cash collection  resulted in the collection of accounts receivable previously provided against 
the result was that  our bad debt expense in  was actually a benefit of million 
our sg a expenses include the amortization of deferred compensation 
in march  we recorded forfeitures of unvested stock options in the amount of million  which reduced the deferred compensation balance to zero with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid in capital 
as a result  we did not record any deferred compensation expense for the second  third and fourth quarters of the deferred compensation amortization for the twelve months ended december  was million 
the deferred compensation expense recorded in was million

there were no similar charges recorded in depreciation and amortization twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars depreciation and amortization   of total revenue the largest component of our depreciation and amortization expense in prior periods was the amortization of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets arising from our acquisitions 
goodwill  which has been amortized over five years  is created when the price at which we acquire a company exceeds the fair value of its net tangible and intangible assets 
as a result of our acquisitions  we amortized substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets in prior years 
in january  upon adoption of sfas  the company reclassified acquired workforce of  as goodwill and ceased amortizing the remaining goodwill balance 
other intangible assets  consisting of customer lists  continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives

net proceeds from the public offering were million 
the decrease in the interest income is the combined result of the decrease in the available cash for investing and the decrease in the interest rates

we established the euro denominated cash accounts in connection with our initial public offering in february  in which we sold shares of our common stock for both us dollars and euros

we had negative cash flow of million for the year ended december   leaving us with million in cash and cash equivalents and million in restricted cash at december  our negative cash flow for improved by million over our negative cash flow for of million 
during  we stated our expectations that we would reach the point of positive cash flows from operating activities and from investing activities during as a result of greater than anticipated impacts on our revenue resulting from the disruptions caused by our strategic plan activities  price erosion and increased competition  we have reset our expectations and now anticipate that we will not reach the point of positive cash flows until at least mid  which is dependent upon the achievement of new and incremental revenues  which we anticipate generating from our new sales and product strategy 
we believe that our available cash will be sufficient to fund our expenditures under our strategic business plans and our working capital and capital expenditure requirements until we achieve positive net cash flows at which time we believe we expect to still have adequate cash reserves remaining to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  even as we pursue our acquisition strategy discussed below 
our expectations for reaching the point of generating positive cash flows in our business is dependant on our successful implementation of our strategic plan and the business focus shift described above under part i business 
there can be no assurances we will be successful in these efforts 
if  contrary to management s expectations  we use all our available cash before reaching the point of positive cash flows  or if we reach such point without sufficient cash reserves remaining  we may not be able to continue our operations unless we obtain other financing 
in their current state  the capital markets do not present a viable source of funds to us 
we expect our capital requirements for to total approximately million primarily to fund growth in revenues 
capital requirements beyond will be related to supporting revenue growth 
in order for us to achieve consolidated positive cash flow  our business plan calls for substantial growth in revenues while continuing to control the costs associated with that revenue 
our estimates of the cash flows generated by the revenue growth and the capital resources needed and available to generate such growth could change  and such change could differ materially from the estimates used to evaluate our ability to realize our plans 
if operations do not generate sufficient cash flow  to continue operating we will need to find other financing mechanisms  which may not be available to us 
the execution of the strategic plan in has increased capital expenditures from levels  and also resulted in cash expenditures for restructuring and other non recurring costs 
whilst we have increased our cash expenditures in the short term for these restructuring and other non recurring costs  we anticipate that this will result in less cash being spent to fund operating losses going forward 
in april  via announced the restarting of its previously authorized stock repurchase plan to acquire up to million worth of via stock 
in the second quarter of  via purchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million 
in the third and fourth quarters of  no shares were repurchased 
this plan can be suspended by via at any time 
as contemplated under our strategic plan refer to item business under subheading identify appropriate targets for acquisition opportunities and heading our strategy  we are pursuing the identification of potential partners and strategic acquisitions 
if we are successful in these endeavors  we may use a portion of our cash balances to finance all or a portion of these potential transactions 
we also intend to seek to utilize the value of our share capital as consideration for any investment 
in connection with this acquisition strategy  in january  we acquired the amen group of companies 
in connection with this acquisition  we spent million cash and issued common stock having a total value of approximately million 
we estimate that amen will contribute positive cash flow in of approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we expect to receive an inflow of cash in the amount of approximately million 
this amount represents proceeds due to our uk operation arising out of the settlement of a litigated contractual dispute 
refer to note subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of operating cash receipts and payments and other working capital changes  especially accounts receivable  other current assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
in both periods  our net losses were the primary component of cash used in operating activities  these losses include some significant non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  impairment and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in for both periods  we used cash to primarily purchase tangible fixed assets and swiss customer lists 
at the end of september  our swiss subsidiary acquired a customer list from a swiss web design and hosting company for cash in the amount of million 
cash used in financing activities was million for year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash was used primarily to purchase treasury stock and in  cash was used primarily to repay capital lease obligations 
payment obligations and contingencies we lease office space  equipment and vehicles under non cancelable operating leases

in addition  this table does not include estimated future capital expenditures that are not yet contracted for 
the operating leases and purchase commitment obligations are off balance sheet commitments 
the purchase commitment obligations relate to our outsourcing agreements for network management  billing and back office transaction processing and committed spend for leased lines from other network providers 
our working capital position at december  is million of which million relates to deferred revenue and will therefore not impact future cash outflows 
capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
we raised approximately million in aggregate through three private preferred stock offerings between august and april through our initial public offering of common stock in february  we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
the foregoing statements regarding our liquidity and possible need for additional capital resources are forward looking statements based on our current expectations  which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of these events could differ materially from these forward looking statements depending upon certain factors that we cannot predict  including the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions and dispositions  if any  our future net income and our success in executing our strategic plan as well as other factors discussed in risk factors included in this form k

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk  related to changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors  as set forth in the risk factors section in item of this form k 
interest rate risks via has exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december  and  via s financial instruments consisted of short term investments and fixed rate debt related to acquisitions and network purchases 
our investments are generally fixed rate short term investment grade and government securities denominated in us dollars 
at december  and all of our investments were due to mature within three months and the carrying value of such investments approximates fair value 
the majority of our debt obligations had fixed rates of interest and was due within one year of the balance sheet date 
foreign currency exchange risks via is an international company that at the end of december had operations in eight countries 
only one operation and the parent company have a functional currency of us dollars 
having operations in foreign currencies exposes via to foreign currency exchange risks 
there are principally two types of foreign exchange risk transaction risks and translation risks 
transaction risks may impact the results of operations and translation risks may impact comprehensive income 
these are discussed more fully below 
transaction risks transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at either the exchange rate in effect at the end of the month in which the transaction occurs or in some cases the rate in effect at the date of the transaction 
differences in exchange rates during the period between the date a transaction denominated in a foreign currency is consummated and the date on which it is settled or translated  are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency gains losses  net 
our local operations transact business in their local currencies 
they do not have significant assets  liabilities or other accounts denominated in currencies other than their local currency  and therefore are not subject to significant exchange rate risk with respect to their normal operations 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations currently have little or no impact on the price of our products and our competitiveness in various markets primarily for two reasons 
first  the company s revenue stream is solely derived from the local operating subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries transact with customers in the same country and the supporting agreements are denominated in the same local currency 
there are no significant cross border customers served by via 
second  the local operating subsidiaries cost base is almost entirely denominated in the local functional currency 
the majority of underlying agreements with backbone and bandwidth suppliers  and salary costs  which comprise the majority of our expenses  are also denominated in the same currency as the local revenue stream 
the parent company s foreign exchange transaction risk is primarily derived from the revaluation of current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than us dollars 
these are comprised principally of euro cash balances held to meet the working capital requirements of the five local operating subsidiaries with a euro functional currency and inter company balances denominated in the local operating subsidiaries functional currency great british pounds  swiss francs and euros 
when required the parent company funds the local operating subsidiaries in their functional currency supported with a corresponding intercompany receivable denominated in the local operating subsidiary s functional currency 
in addition  inter company charges between the parent company and the local operating subsidiaries are transacted in the functional currency of the operating entity 
thus  the parent company s intercompany balances are held in the operating subsidiaries local functional currency and consequently are revalued on a monthly basis 
the resultant foreign exchange gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency gains losses  net 
the parent company s cash balances consist of euros and us dollars 
the euro bank account is revalued each month and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency gains losses  net 
this exposes the company to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the statement of operations 
for example  at december   a increase or decrease in the level of the euro exchange rate against the dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a realized gain or loss of million 
as of december   a increase or decrease in the level of the euro exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a realized gain or loss of million 
the change in exposure from year to year is related to the change in the balance of the euro cash and intercompany accounts 
to minimize the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in  via purchased million worth of us dollars on march   thus substantially reducing the balance in the euro cash account 
the company continues to hold approximately million in the euro cash account and remains exposed to changes in the foreign currency rate 
however  such rate fluctuations should have a smaller impact as the balance has been reduced 
the fluctuation in the exchange rates resulted in foreign currency gains reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency losses gains  net of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
translation risks the financial statements of the company s local operating subsidiaries with a functional currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars using the current rate method 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated at period end exchange rates while revenue and expenses are translated at the period s average exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from these translations are accumulated and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
the fluctuation in the exchange rates resulted in a foreign currency loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  net of million and million for years ended december  and december   respectively 
exchange rates can vary significantly 
the euro high and low rates varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during the year ended december  the british pound high and low rates varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during the year ended december  this variation affects the average exchange rates used to translate the income statements of our operating companies whose functional currency is not us dollars 
at december   the euro to us dollar exchange rate was approximately above where it was at the beginning of the year and the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was approximately above where it was at the beginning of the year 
this variation affects the ending exchange rates used to translate amounts on the balance sheet of our operating companies whose functional currency is not us dollars 
future changes in the value of the euro and gbp could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we also experienced fluctuations in other exchange rates 
hedging against foreign exchange risks for the year ended december  we did not actively manage our exposure to foreign currency translation risks that affect our reported results  which result in no cash impact unless the operation is sold 
we have in the past considered insurance and financial risk products to manage this risk  but determined such products to be prohibitively expensive 
we currently have no hedging arrangements or derivatives in place to address this form of translation risk 
the parent company maintains a euro cash balance to meet the working capital requirements of the five local operating subsidiaries with a euro functional currency 
the parent company maintains its remaining cash resources in us dollars 
subsequent to december   we invested million in dual currency deposits 
with these deposits  we have the option to buy euros at a fixed exchange rate of us dollars to euro on maturity 
the deposits mature in equal installments on march  april and may   and bear interest at rates between and 
in the future  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange risk based on materiality of any usd transactions
