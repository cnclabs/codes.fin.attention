item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and production of crude oil and natural gas 
our principal means of growth has been through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing properties 
as a result of our historical acquisition activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of low risk exploitation and development opportunities  the successful completion of which is critical to the maintenance and growth of our current production levels 
we have incurred net losses in three of the last five years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations o the sales prices of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the level of total sales volumes of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the availability of  and our ability to raise additional  capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  o the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and o the level and success of exploitation and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging activities 
our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in january  the market price of natural gas was at its highest level in our operating history and the price of crude oil was also at a high level 
however  over the course of and the beginning of the first quarter of  prices again became depressed  primarily due to the economic downturn 
beginning in march  commodity prices began to increase and continued higher through december prices have remained strong during the first part of the table below illustrates how natural gas prices fluctuated over the course of and the table below contains the last three day average of nymex traded contracts price and the prices we realized during each quarter for and  including the impact of our hedging activities

we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in and  we experienced hedging losses of million and million  respectively 
in october  all of these hedge agreements expired 
we made total payments over the term of these arrangements to various counterparties in the amount of million 
under the terms of our senior credit agreement  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our crude oil and natural gas production  on an equivalent basis  for a rolling six month period 
as of december   we had the following hedges in place time period notional quantities price march  february   mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day march  april   mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day march  april  bbls of crude oil floor of production per day may  mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day june bbls of crude oil floor of production per day june bbls of crude oil floor of production per day july  mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day july bbls of crude oil floor of production per day subsequent to year end we have entered into additional agreements similar to those scheduled above floors in volume amounts sufficient to reach the threshold required by our senior credit agreement 
the company anticipates continuing to purchase similar floors in the future to satisfy our requirements under the senior credit agreement 
production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced  unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation and development projects 
for more information on the volumes of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas we have produced during  and  please refer to the information under the caption results of operations below 
we have budgeted million for drilling expenditures in under the terms of our senior credit agreement and our new notes  we are subject to limitations on capital expenditures 
as a result  we will be limited in our ability to replace existing production with new production and might suffer a decrease in the volume of crude oil and natural gas we produce 
if crude oil and natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production levels continue to decrease  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources current liquidity requirements and future capital resources 
availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  funding under our senior credit agreement and the sale of properties 
at march   we had approximately million of availability under our senior credit agreement 
we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such efforts 
borrowings and interest 
as a result of the financial restructuring we completed in january  we reduced our indebtedness from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  in addition  we decreased our cash interest expense from million during to million during by decreasing the amount of our indebtedness and required cash interest payments  we reduced the amount of our cash flow from operations needed to pay interest on our indebtedness so that more of our capital resources could be utilized for drilling activities and paying other expenses 
exploitation and development activity during  we continued exploitation activities on our us properties 
we participated in the drilling of gross net wells with gross net being successful 
the company invested million in capital spending on these activities during at the end of  as a result of these activities  our average daily production was approximately mmcfepd  a increase from the daily production rate at the beginning of the year excluding production from the canadian properties sold in january

during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased production volumes  primarily due to the sale of our canadian subsidiaries in january  which was partially offset by higher commodity prices realized during the period 
higher commodity prices contributed million to crude oil and natural gas revenue while reduced production volumes had a million negative impact on revenue 
the canadian properties which were sold in january contributed million to revenues from crude oil and natural gas for the year ended december   compared to million in through the date of sale january  
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in the decline in natual gas liquids volumes was due almost entirely to the sale of our canadian subsidiaries in january these properties contributed mbbls of natural gas liquids in compared to mbbls during crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during the canadian properties which were sold in january contributed mbbls of crude oil production in compared to mbbls in through the date of the sale 
crude oil production volumes relating to the canadian properties which were retained and current drilling activities in canada resulted in an increase to mbbls in compared to mbbls in crude oil production from us operations decreased due primarily to natural field declines 
natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in this decrease is primarily due to the sale of our canadian subsidiaries in january the canadian properties sold contributed bcf in compared to 
mmcf in through the date of sale 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense  or loe  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in loe is primarily due the sale of canadian abraxas and old grey wolf in january loe related to the properties owned by canadian abraxas and old grey wolf was million for the year ended december  excluding the properties sold  loe attributable to on going operations increased  primarily due to higher production taxes associated with higher commodity prices in as compared to our loe on a per mcfe basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to for  primarily due to the decrease in production volumes 
g a expense 
general and administrative  or g a  expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in g a expense was primarily due to a reduction in personnel in connection with the sale of canadian abraxas and old grey wolf on january  our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due primarily to lower production volumes in as compared to g a stock based compensation expense 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb under the interpretation  certain modifications to fixed stock option awards which were made subsequent to december   and not exercised prior to july   require that the awards be subject to variable accounting until they are exercised  forfeited  or expired 
in march  we amended the exercise price to on all options with an existing exercise price greater than 
in january  we amended the exercise price to per share on certain options with an existing exercise price greater than per share which resulted in variable accounting 
we charged approximately million to stock based compensation expense in related to these repricings 
during  we did not recognize any stock based compensation due to the decline in the price of our common stock 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in dd a was primarily due to the sale of our canadian subsidiaries in january as well as ceiling limitation write downs in the second quarter of our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million to million for compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to the reduction in debt in total debt was reduced as a result of the transactions which occurred on january  total debt was million as of december  compared to million at december  ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting 
for more information on the full cost method of accounting  you should read the description under critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
at june   our net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering june  prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
subsequent to june   commodity prices increased in canada and we utilized these increased prices in calculating the ceiling limitation write down 
the total write down was approximately million 
at december  our net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated reserves  due to increased commodity prices during and  as such  no write down was recorded in we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas assets increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved resources are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased from a benefit of million for the year ended december  to an expense of  for the year ended december  the expense in was related to the operations of the canadian properties prior to their sale on january  there is no current or deferred income tax expense for related to on going operations due to the valuation allowance which has been recorded against the deferred tax asset 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in production volumes and lower commodity prices in as compared to crude oil and natural gas revenue was impacted by million from a decline in commodity prices and million from reduced production 
the decline in production was due to the disposition of certain properties in south texas and natural field declines 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in production declines were primarily attributable to our disposition of assets during and natural field declines 
average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
lease operating expense 
loe expense decreased from million in to million in loe on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the decrease in the per mcfe cost is due to a reduced operating cost offset by the decline in production volumes 
g a expense 
g a expense increased slightly from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to increased legal expenses related to ongoing litigation in our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due primarily to lower production volumes in as compared to g a stock based compensation expense

dd a expense 
dd a expense decreased by million from million in to million in the decline in dd a is due to reductions in our full cost pool resulting from ceiling test write downs  as well as lower production volumes 
our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in interest expense 
interest expense increased from million to million for compared to the increase was the result of additional sales pursuant to our production payment arrangement with mirant americas as well as increased borrowings under old grey wolf s credit facility in the production payment was reacquired in june for approximately million 
ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting 
for more information on the full cost method of accounting  you should read the description under critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
as of december   the company s net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of its estimated proved reserves by million 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
the company did not adjust its capitalized costs for its us properties because subsequent to december   crude oil and natural gas prices increased such that capitalized costs for its us properties did not exceed the present value of the estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves for its us properties as determined using increased realized prices on march  of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas 
at june   our net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering june  prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
subsequent to june   commodity prices increased in canada and we utilized these increased prices in calculating the ceiling limitation write down 
the total write down was approximately million 
at december   our net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated reserves  due to increased commodity prices during the fourth quarter and  as such  no further write down was recorded 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas assets increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved resources are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from an expense of million for the year ended december  to a benefit of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit relating to the ceiling limitation write down related to our canadian properties 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs o the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  o acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  and o production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to service our existing debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  funding under the senior credit agreement and the sale of properties 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
significant downturns in commodity prices  such as that experienced in the last nine months of and the first quarter of  can reduce our cash from operating activities 
although we have hedged a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production and will continue this practice as required pursuant to the senior credit agreement  future crude oil and natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
low crude oil and natural gas prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us and could also reduce the borrowing base under our senior credit agreement 
if the volume of crude oil and natural gas we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
in addition  due to sales of properties in and january  we now have reduced reserves and production levels 
in the future  we may sell additional properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
while we have had some success in pursuing these activities  historically  we have not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
working capital 
at december   our current liabilities of approximately million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million as of december  current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties million  accrued interest related to our new notes of million  of which is non cash and other accrued liabilities of million 
we do not expect to make cash interest payments with respect to the outstanding new notes  and the issuance of additional new notes in lieu of cash interest payments thereon will not affect our working capital balance 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category development    facilities and other total    during  and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
we currently have a capital expenditure budget of million for  of which million is allocated to us projects and million is allocated to canadian drilling projects 
we plan to participate in the drilling or putting on production of gross net wells  of which gross net wells will be operated by us 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but we currently have no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset crude oil and natural gas production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below dollars in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    total    operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
investing activities provided us million during financing activities used million during most of these funds were used to reduce our long term debt and were generated by the sale of our canadian subsidiaries and the exchange offer completed in january the sale of our canadian subsidiaries contributed million in reduced by million in exploration and development expenditures 
expenditures in were primarily for the development of crude oil and natural gas properties 
operating activities for the year ended december  used million of cash 
investing activities used million during our investing activities included the sale of properties which provided million  and the use of million primarily for the development of producing properties 
financing activities provided us with million during  relating primarily to advances on old grey wolf s credit facility 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us million of cash 
investing activities included the sale of properties which provided million  and the use of million for the development of producing properties and million for the acquisition of the minority interest in grey wolf 
financing activities provided million during  including the provision of additional funding of million under our production payment arrangement with mirant americas  and the provision of million under old grey wolf s credit facility 
payments on long term debt used million 
future capital resources 
we will have four principal sources of liquidity going forward i cash on hand  ii cash from operating activities  iii funding under the senior credit agreement  and iv sales of producing properties 
covenants under the indenture for the new notes and the senior credit agreement restrict our use of cash on hand  cash from operating activities and any proceeds from asset sales 
we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  although the terms of the new note indenture and the senior credit agreement substantially restrict our ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o incur liens  o pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  o consummate certain asset sales  o enter into certain transactions with affiliates  o merge or consolidate with any other person  or o sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements o long term debt o operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  contractual obligations payments due in dollars in thousands total less than more than one year years years years long term debt    operating leases  these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the senior credit agreement and the new notes 
these repayments assume that interest will be capitalized under the new notes and that periodic interest on the senior credit agreement will be paid on a monthly basis and that we will not draw down additional funds thereunder 
these amounts represent office lease obligations 
leases for office space for abraxas and new grey wolf expire in april and december  respectively 
other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion 
long term indebtedness 
the financial restructuring completed in january resulted in the retirement of our first lien notes  second lien notes and old notes  together with the old grey wolf credit facility 
the following table sets forth our long term indebtedness as of december   and long term indebtedness december in thousands senior notes due old notes senior secured notes due first lien notes  second lien notes due second lien notes  senior credit facility grey wolf facility providing for borrowings up to approximately us million cdn million

the face amount of the new notes was million at december  including million in new notes issued for interest 
the new notes accrue interest from the date of issuance  at a fixed annual rate of  payable in cash semi annually on each may and november  commencing may  we will pay such unpaid interest in kind by the issuance of additional new notes with a principal amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid cash interest on the new notes plus an additional accrued interest for the applicable period 
upon an event of default  the new notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 
the new notes are secured by a second lien or charge on all of our current and future assets  including  but not limited to  all of our crude oil and natural gas properties

if abraxas cannot make payments on the new notes when they are due  the guarantors must make them instead 
the new notes and related guarantees o are subordinated to the indebtedness under the new senior secured credit agreement  o rank equally with all of abraxas current and future senior indebtedness  and o rank senior to all of abraxas current and future subordinated indebtedness  in each case  if any 
the new notes are subordinated to amounts outstanding under the new senior secured credit agreement both in right of payment and with respect to lien priority and are subject to an intercreditor agreement 
abraxas may redeem the new notes  at its option  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount set forth below 
if abraxas redeems all or any new notes  it must also pay all interest accrued and unpaid to the applicable redemption date

uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company has established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
related party transactions accounts receivable other includes approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  representing amounts due from officers relating to advances made to employees 
on july  abraxas acquired all of the shares of the capital stock of wind river resources corporation which owned an airplane 
the sole shareholder of wind river was the company s president 
the consideration for the purchase was  shares of abraxas common stock and  in cash 
simultaneously with this transaction  the airplane was sold 
the airplane had previously been made available to abraxas employees for business use 
the company paid wind river a total of approximately   and  in  and  through july  respectively  for wind river s operating cost associated with the company s use of the plane 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
abraxas has chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our crude oil and natural gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
the company has experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of approximately million 
the write down in was due to low commodity prices 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  o and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that it is reasonably possible that estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas revenues could significantly change in the future 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes crude oil and natural gas revenue from its interest in producing wells as crude oil and natural gas is sold from those wells  net of royalties 
revenue from the processing of natural gas is recognized in the period the service is performed 
the company utilizes the sales method to account for gas production volume imbalances 
under this method  income is recorded based on the company s net revenue interest in production taken for delivery 
the company had no material gas imbalances 
asset retirement obligations the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
hedge accounting 
from time to time  we use commodity price hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
results of those hedging transactions are reflected in crude oil and natural gas sales 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for the company on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under this statement  all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow or fair value hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales or interest expense  as applicable  over the respective contract terms 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated because energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of  as of december  we did not have any outstanding derivatives 
new accounting pronouncements a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  the company would be required to reclassify approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
the company s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas is effective for us january  sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted sfas effective january  for the year ended december  the company recorded a charge of  for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principal and a liability of million 
during  the company charged approximately  to expense related to the accretion of the liability 
the impact on each of the prior periods was not material 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
effective january   the company adopted sfas sfas retains the requirement to recognize an impairment loss only where the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and to measure such loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
sfas  among other things  changes the criteria that have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale and requires that operating losses from discontinued operations be recognized in the period that the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date 
this new standard had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires costs associated with exit of disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
the official effective date of this standard has not been determined by the fasb 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 among other things  clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fin sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the company adopted this statement effective july  implementation of this new standard did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation does not specify the subsequent measurement of the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the guidance in fin does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as those issued by insurance companies or for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations would not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
fin specifies additional disclosures effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  in january the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
fin establishes the definition of vies to encompass a broader group of entities than those previously considered special purpose entities spes 
fin specifies the criteria under which it is appropriate for an investor to consolidate vies  in order for an investor to consolidate a vie  the entity must fall within the definition of vie and the investor must fall within the definition of primary beneficiary  both newly defined terms under this fin 
the revised effective date of fin for public companies with vies meeting certain conditions  will be the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretaion no 
r m which expanded and clarified the guidelines of fin in may  the fasb issued fas no 
 entitled accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company has no financial instruments affected by sfas  therefore adoption by the company as of july  will not impact the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent crude oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices would have reduced our operating revenue  cash flow and net income by approximately million for the year 
hedging sensitivity on january   we adopted sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
as of december  the derivatives that we have in place are not designated as hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded in current period oil and gas revenue 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to a cash flow hedge that becomes ineffective  remain unchanged until the related production is delivered 
if we determine that it is probable that a hedged transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
gains and losses on qualified hedging instruments related to accumulated other comprehensive income and adjustments to carrying amounts on hedged production are included in natural gas or crude oil production revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting  changes in the fair market value of the instrument are charged to income in the current period 
in and  we experienced hedging losses of million and million  respectively 
in october  all of these hedge agreements expired 
under the expired hedge agreements  we made total payments to various counterparties in the amount of million 
under the terms of the senior secured credit agreement  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our crude oil and natural gas production for a rolling six month period 
as of december  the company s hedge positions were as follows time period notional quantities price march  february   mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day march  april   mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day march  april  bbls of crude oil floor of production per day may  mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day may bbls of crude oil floor of production per day june bbls of crude oil floor of production per day july  mmbtu of natural gas floor of production per day july bbls of crude oil floor of production per day subsequent to year end we have entered into additional agreements similar to those scheduled above floors in volume amounts sufficient to reach the threshold required by our senior credit agreement 
the company anticipates continuing to purchase similar floors in the future to satisfy our requirements under the senior credit agreement 
interest rate risk at december   as a result of the financial restructuring that occurred in january  we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness under the new senior secured credit agreement  accruing interest at a rate of prime plus  subject to a minimum interest rate of 
in the event that the prime rate currently rises above the interest rate applicable to our outstanding indebtedness under the new senior secured credit agreement will rise accordingly 
for every percentage point that the prime rate rises above  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis 
our new notes accrue interest at fixed rates and are accordingly not subject to fluctuations in market rates 
as discussed in business general the senior secured credit agreement was amended in february our interest rate under the terms of the amended credit agreement is a floating rate  currently at approximately  assuming all available amounts are borrowed 
foreign currency our canadian operations are measured in the local currency of canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets 
our ongoing canadian operations reported a pre tax income  for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the canadian dollar would have changed our net income by approximately  we do not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
