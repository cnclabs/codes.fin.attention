item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business in  our business was organized into three business segments ipg  which principally focuses on enterprise class database servers  integration and development products  ias  which provides mobile database and mobile enterprise solutions  and ffi  which delivers integrated banking  payment and trade messaging solutions to large financial institutions 
during  approximately percent of our revenues were generated from the us with the balance generated from our non us operations

our results we reported net income of million for  compared to net income of million in before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  and a net loss of million in total revenues were million for  compared to million for  and million for the decline in total revenues from to was primarily due to lower license  consulting and education revenues 
however  these declines were more than fully offset by a decrease in our overall costs and expenses  and an increase in our technical support revenues 
in  our revenues from technical support services increased percent compared to which increased percent compared to 
furthermore  our operating margin doubled from percent in to percent in due to our continued management of operating expenses and the benefits realized from our restructuring activities 
our overall financial position remains strong 
during we generated net cash from operating activities of million  and had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments at december  the highest in our history 
we have no long term debt 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable improved to days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december  looking ahead  we believe we are well positioned to realize the objectives of our unwired enterprise initiative and to lead the expansion of enterprise software to the mobile and wireless business environment 
we continue to win praise for our market leading mobile and wireless solutions  and our core database products that enable data liquidity 
for example  the latest version of sql anywhere studio was recently honored with a best of award by the editors of pc magazine 
for a discussion of factors that may impact our business  see future operating results  below 

table of contents business trends the market for new sales of enterprise infrastructure software continued to be challenging in due to various factors including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market  changing patterns in it spending  and mixed signs of economic recovery in the us the majority of our license fees revenues came from sales to our existing customers in  and fewer of those clients undertook large scale infrastructure investments requiring significant investment in our core enterprise database products and related services this also contributed to a decline in our consulting and education revenues 
we believe this is partly due to market saturation in some of our target markets including financial services  insurance and telecommunications where large enterprises have invested heavily in their core database infrastructures during the past years 
despite these trends  revenues attributable to ase  our core enterprise database product  grew percent from levels 
further  the recent release of ase powered by intel s itanium processor on unix and linux has been well received both by customers and industry analysts 
in  we observed some notable changes in it spending patterns 
specifically  we began to see an overall increase in our transaction volume for license revenues  but an overall decrease in the average dollar value of these deals 
this pattern supports the view that fiscally cautious customers are purchasing products and services based more on present need and less on fulfilling anticipated future needs 
global market conditions generally improved in compared to however  mixed signs of a strong us economic recovery make it difficult to project whether the overall market for enterprise infrastructure software will materially improve 
moving forward  we will continue to manage our operating expenses as we aggressively pursue our business initiatives and strategic alliances with our key partners including hp  intel  and others 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principals require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  restructuring  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
see also future operating results financial accounting related matters  below 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex  and we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fees revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement is in force  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 

table of contents residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements such as license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the licenses  provided i the above criteria are met  ii payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of license fees is dependent on performance of services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours completed 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revision as contract phases are actually completed 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees revenue for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment to the end user or direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when the fee is actually collected 
service revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts and for education are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from other contract services are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting described above 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
prior to  these assets were generally recorded at amortized cost 
the carrying values of these intangible assets were reviewed on a periodic basis  under the accounting rules then in effect  and our testing indicated no impairment of the assets carrying value 
beginning in  new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb provided that goodwill could no longer be amortized  but had to be tested for impairment at least annually 
these rules further changed the method of evaluating goodwill from a recoverability test based upon undiscounted cash flows to a fair value approach 
the application of these new rules resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
table of contents of million in the first quarter of and a goodwill impairment of million in the fourth quarter of as of december   our goodwill balance totaled million 
the review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates to determine both the fair values and the carrying values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other intangible assets including in process research and development  and developed technology 
we performed the annual impairment analysis as of december  for each of our reporting units 
this analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we were not required to recognize an impairment loss in however  changes in our internal business structure  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
since a goodwill impairment charge is based on the value of a reporting unit at the testing date  reporting units that previously reported an impairment charge  such as ffi in  are particularly prone to additional impairment charges if future revenue and expense forecasts or market conditions worsen after the testing date 
we continue to review our other intangible assets purchased technology  trade names and customer lists for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
see note one to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
additional allowances might be required if deteriorating economic conditions or other factors affect our customers ability to make timely payments 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
subjective judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon general release 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues and reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future costs of completing and disposing of certain products 
changes in these estimates could result in write offs of capitalized software costs 
restructuring we have recorded significant accruals in connection with various restructuring activities 
these accruals include estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations  based on the analysis of 
table of contents independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from the estimates 
for example  if we are able to negotiate more affordable termination fees  if rental rates increase in the markets where the properties are located  or if we are able to locate suitable sublease tenants more quickly than expected  the actual costs could be lower than our estimates 
in that case  we would reduce our restructuring accrual with a corresponding credit to cost of restructuring 
alternatively  if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates continue to decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or if it takes us longer then expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates 
see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period 
subjective judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
see note eight to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
stock based compensation sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
see also note one to consolidated financial statements stock based compensation  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
contingencies and liabilities we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other things 
when we reasonably determine that a liability has been or will be incurred  and can reasonably estimate the range of potential losses in these matters  we are required to adequately provide for these loss contingencies 
even if we are not able to estimate the amount of potential loss in these matters  in the case of a potential material matter  we are required to disclose that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we have underestimated the potential liability in any matter 

table of contents results of operations revenues dollars in millions change change license fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues total revenues not meaningful total revenues for decreased percent from total revenues in which had decreased percent from 
the decline in was primarily attributable to a percent drop in license fees revenues  and a percent decline in consulting and education revenues which was partially offset by a percent increase in technical support revenues 
the major factors contributing to the decline in our license fees and services revenues overall are discussed in overview  above  and future operating results  below 
in  license fees revenues accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues 
the most significant decline in license fees revenues resulted from lower than expected sales of certain ipg e business products partially due a major shift in the business of one of our largest north american resellers that significantly lowered the reseller s need to use our technology as part of its offering 
the decrease in license fees revenues which accounted for about percent of our total revenues that year was primarily attributable to a decline in license fees revenues from our enterprise database and mobile database products partially offset by an increase in license fees revenues of certain e business products 
we believe the events of triggered a downturn in the global economy in that contributed to the cancellation or delay of many of large scale it infrastructure investments 
despite declining license fees revenues  our services revenues  which accounted for approximately percent of total revenues  remained relatively flat from levels which had declined percent from levels 
our technical support revenues which accounted for percent of total services revenues  were driven primarily by a steady level of support renewals by existing customers 
meanwhile  revenues from education services which are highly dependent on sales of new products  and revenues from consulting services which are driven by the implementation of large enterprise systems declined in for the reasons discussed in overview  above 
the decrease in services revenues was due to a percent decrease in consulting and education revenues partially offset by a percent increase in technical support revenues as a result of the economic factors discussed above

as discussed in revenues  above  we believe a major shift in the business of one of our largest north american resellers resulting in significantly lower sales of our technology contributed to this decline

total international revenues decreased percent in from due to a percent decrease in license fees revenues and a percent decrease in consulting and education revenues offset by an percent decrease in technical support revenues 
the slight decline in emea europe  middle east and africa revenues was attributable to lower revenues from e business products  largely offset by an increase in revenues from our enterprise database products 
the percent decrease in intercontinental asia pacific and latin america revenues was due a drop in license fees and services revenues from our enterprise database products 
in  total international revenues decreased percent from levels due to declines in license revenues in both emea and the intercontinental regions 
emea revenues declined by percent in due to a percent decline in license fees revenues  primarily from our enterprise database products  and a percent decrease in consulting and education revenues 
in  the decline in intercontinental revenues was due to a percent decrease in license fees revenues primarily from our enterprise database products  and a percent decrease in professional services revenues partially offset by an percent increase in technical support revenues 
in emea and the intercontinental region  most revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
the cumulative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from to resulted in a percent increase in our revenues and a percent increase in our operating expenses 
this change was primarily due to the weakness of the us dollar against certain european currencies 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and expenses was not material in our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  even though we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of worldwide software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the future

given this lower than expected revenue  we reduced our projections regarding revenues for the remainder of the year and began to identify means of reducing our cost structure to produce earnings in line with revised plan amounts 
after this review  and in order to reduce our fixed quarterly cost structure  we embarked on a restructuring plan plan aimed at reducing our annual payroll and facilities related expenses by approximately million 
these activities included the planned termination of approximately employees worldwide and the planned closure or consolidation of approximately facilities worldwide 
it is anticipated that the total costs  once the restructuring activities prescribed under the plan are fully completed  will be million 
in general  these expenses will be incurred over a month period although certain expenses may extend beyond this twelve month time frame depending upon when the costs associated with the sublease of certain facilities are incurred

these rules are currently effective for any variable interest in vies created after january  of which we have none and will be effective for variable interests in vies created before january  in our quarter ending march  we do not expect the adoption of the effective provisions of interpretation to have any impact on our consolidated financial position or statement of operations

financial risk management foreign exchange risk we experience foreign exchange translation exposure on our net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the related foreign currency translation gains and losses from translating these amounts into us dollars for subsidiaries that conduct their business in us currencies are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
as of december   we had identifiable net assets totaling million associated with our emea operations and million associated with our intercontinental operations 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non us dollar denominated sales and expenses in emea  asia pacific  and latin america 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
specifically  we enter into forward contracts with a maturity of approximately days to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure created by certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the principal reporting

the gains and losses on the forward contracts are meant to mitigate the gains and losses on these outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in interest expense and other  net

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of taxable  short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only safe  high investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a variety of significant risks  some of which are discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k 
we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report including those regarding forward looking statements described on page revenue related factors in  the decline in our license  consulting and education services revenues was offset by a variety of factors including an increase in technical support services revenues  our vigilant control over operating expenses  and the benefits realized from our restructuring activities see overview  above 
although our technical support revenues have increased steadily over the past several years  we have begun to encounter increased pricing pressure from customers during technical support renewal negotiations 
if this trend continues  or if customers cancel or delay renewal of their technical support contracts  our ability to maintain and grow this source of revenue could be adversely affected 
our restructuring activities over the past several years and our management of operating expenses allowed us to double our operating margins from to however  we do not believe we can further reduce our current cost structure in any material respects without fundamentally changing elements of our current business 
while we are confident in our ability to control our operating expenses going forward  our future operating margin expansion will need to be generated from increased top line revenues 
despite the challenges created by such factors  we intend to continue controlling costs and pursuing our business strategies  including our recently announced unwired enterprise initiative which focuses on leveraging our lead in the expansion of enterprise level software to mobile and wireless solutions 
we also intend to continue creating and maintaining successful strategic and global alliances with key partners including intel  sun microsystems  apple computer  hewlett packard and sap  to provide customers with optimal solutions based on our leading edge technology and our partners capabilities in specific markets 
if we are unable to achieve these goals  or if we are unable to overcome the challenges discussed elsewhere in this report  our ability to grow top line revenues will be significantly impaired 
this  in turn  could adversely impact our results of operations  even if we continue to generate a profit and to maintain positive cash flows 
increasingly complex revenue recognition rules for software companies directly affect our ability to measure revenue for any given accounting period 
such rules are subject to constant review and revision by various bodies tasked with establishing accounting standards 
therefore  modifications or new interpretations of existing accounting guidance governing revenue recognition in the software industry could have a material effect on our business 
in addition to the above factors  the timing and amount of our revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
in our experience  license fees revenues tend to decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year 
this has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the prior fourth quarter 
we currently anticipate that this seasonal pattern will continue 
since we operate with little or no backlog  quarterly revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded approximately to percent of our quarterly revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks 
during  we experienced an overall increase in the volume of transactions for license revenues  but an overall decrease in the average dollar value of these deals 
therefore  although many of our customers are larger enterprises  an apparent trend toward more conservative it spending has resulted in fewer of these large customers making substantial investments in our products and services in any given quarter 
therefore  our inability to record or recognize one or more orders of million or greater in the aggregate at the very end of a quarter could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating expenses are based on projected annual and 
table of contents quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could impact operating results  causing an operating loss for that period 
in north america where approximately percent of our total revenues were generated in  we currently ship most of our products from our dublin  california facility near the site of our corporate headquarters 
because we tend to record a high percentage of revenues during the last two weeks of each quarter  disruption of operations at that facility eg  due to natural calamity or systems failure could directly harm our ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 
impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in we determined under sfas that the carrying value of ffi s goodwill exceeded its implied value by million 
consequently  we were required to recognize the impairment loss in the fourth quarter of  which affected our reported earnings 
if we are required to recognize additional impairment losses in the future  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
see critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  above  and note one to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
changing legal and accounting environment during the past several years  various accounting guidance has been issued with respect to revenue recognition rules in the software industry 
however  much of this guidance addresses software revenue recognition primarily from a conceptual level  and is silent as to specific implementation requirements 
as a consequence  accounting firms and their clients have been required to make assumptions  in certain circumstances  regarding application of the rules to transactions not addressed by the existing rules 
we believe our current business arrangements and contract terms have been properly reported under the current rules 
however  if final interpretations of these rules necessitate a change in our current revenue recognition practices  our results of operations  financial condition and business could be materially and adversely affected 
for further discussion  see critical accounting policies and estimates  above 
in addition to the above  the us congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act of soa in july  largely in response to a rash of financial scandals involving public companies such as enron and worldcom 
the soa provides for sweeping and unprecedented corporate reforms  focusing on public company financial reporting  corporate ethics  and oversight of the accounting profession  among other areas  and establishing harsher civil and criminal penalties for violation of us securities laws 
certain provisions of the soa became effective immediately  and others required the sec and the national securities exchanges to enact rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of the act 
many of these new sec mandated rules and procedures including rules requiring personal certification of a company s sec reports by the company s chief executive officer and senior financial officers  accelerated filing of certain sec reports  and changes in the role and functions of a company s audit committee  became effective during the latter half of and during many additional rules and regulations  including those enacted by the new york stock exchange where our common stock is traded are effective starting in we believe our corporate practices and standards meet or exceed the current rules and regulations currently in effect 
however  new or additional rules that influence significant adjustments to our business practices and procedures could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes that could adversely affect our results of operations 
in the last half of  the financial accounting standards board fasb made several significant decisions regarding its ongoing project on accounting for stock based compensation 
we currently account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
however  it is expected that fasb will issue new rules sometime in the third 
table of contents quarter of requiring companies to expense employee stock options and other equity based compensation at fair value beginning in january these rulings likely will affect the accounting for our current employee stock option and stock purchase plans  and could have an adverse effect on our accounting for compensation expenses if we are unable to modify our plans in an appropriate or timely manner 
stock price volatility our ability to exceed  or our failure to achieve  expected operating results for any period could significantly impact our stock price 
inevitably  some investors will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the timing of their investment 
the market for our stock and for technology stocks in general has been highly volatile  and the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in recent years 
during and early  us stock prices in general experienced a significant downturn  due in part to the collapse of dot 
com stocks  continued war and political unrest in the middle east and a struggling economic recovery in the us although our stock price stabilized and experienced a rebound in the latter half of compared to levels  our stock price may fluctuate in the future in response to a variety of factors including the progress of the us economic recovery  our financial results  press and industry analyst reports  market acceptance of our products and pricing policies  activities of competitors  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies by sybase and other events 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have categorically affected the market price for high technology companies  but which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
competition and industry consolidation the it industry and the market for our core database infrastructure products and services is becoming more competitive due to a variety of factors including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market  changes in customer it spending habits  and a slow economic recovery in the us see overview  above 
there is also a growing trend toward consolidations in the software industry eg  peoplesoft  inc s acquisition of eg edwards  and ibm s acquisition of the informix database business 
continued consolidation within the software industry could result in the larger software companies including ibm corporation  microsoft corporation and oracle corporation increasing their market share through the acquisition of smaller companies that  for example  dominate certain lucrative market niches or that have loyal installed customer bases 
this could pose a significant competitive disadvantage to sybase 
many of these companies may have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  and a larger installed customer base than sybase 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could overshadow our own and or adversely influence customer perception of our products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  we must be able to develop and promote new products and businesses  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies  all in a timely manner 
our failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in any of these areas  or other areas  could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate new revenues 
product development increased widespread use of the internet and fast growing market demand for mobile and wireless solutions may significantly alter how we do business in the future 
this could affect our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services at competitive prices  which could significantly impact our ability to generate future revenues 
our acquisition of avantgo in allows us to significantly enhance our ias mobile  wireless and embedded solutions 
we believe our focus on these solutions and services and our other strategies will enhance revenues and profitability 
however  if the market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or if our solutions and services do not successfully compete in the relevant markets  we may not realize expected revenues and profitability 

table of contents our future results may also be affected if our products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not interoperable with our products  and others may never be 
in addition  many of our principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm our business and prospects 
changes in sales model our sales model has evolved significantly during the past few years to keep pace with new and developing markets and changing business environments 
if we have misjudged demand for our products and services in our target markets  or if we are unable to coordinate our sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  this could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects 
in january  we reorganized our sales focus with the creation of the infrastructure platform group ipg  which focused on increasing market presence and revenue through solution partners eg  isvs  vars and oems and delivery partners eg  sis  distributors and resellers 
in the process of this reorganization  we brought three of our former divisions esd  ebd and bid under a single umbrella  and reduced the number of our business divisions from five to three 
in may  we announced the launch of ias  which was formed to continue the business of our former  the mec division in mobile and embedded e business products and services 
in january  we acquired hfn now ffi to increase our focus on the financial services market 
ebd was created in the second quarter of when we acquired nen  and consisted of certain operations of nen along with certain products previously in the esd segment and certain products previously in the former internet applications division iad 
in january  we realigned our direct sales force  product teams and professional services capabilities into four divisions 
this reorganization was intended to enhance overall revenues and profitability by providing increased focus on each of four key markets enterprise solutions  mobile and embedded computing  internet applications and business intelligence 
other organizational changes in our sales or divisional model  including certain changes that were instituted in february  could have a direct affect on our results of operations depending on how quickly and effectively our employees and management are able to adapt to and maximize the advantages these changes are intended to create 
international operations we continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future 
in  revenues outside north america represented percent of our total revenues 
because of this  global political unrest  acts of terrorism and continued unrest and war in the middle east could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations 
as a global concern  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for a discussion of risks associated with currency fluctuation  see financial risk management foreign exchange risk above  incorporated here by reference 
our revenues outside north america could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes we have made to accommodate these conditions 
for example  during we transferred ownership of avantgo to ias  de registered our subsidiary in the lao people s democratic republic  and completed the dissolution of a former german subsidiary of nen 
the prior year  we centralized finance functions within specific geographic regions rather than maintaining them on a country by country basis  closed a subsidiary in the czech republic  and dissolved nen as well as several of its majority owned and wholly owned subsidiaries 
in february  we acquired our distributor in denmark and in september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of our distributor in mexico 
other factors that could significantly impact aspects of our international operations include 
table of contents changes in political  regulatory  or economic conditions changes or limitations in trade protection laws changes in tax treaties or laws favorable to sybase natural disasters intellectual property our inability to obtain adequate copyright  patent or trade secret protection for our products in certain countries may have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
in addition  as the number of software products and associated patents increase  it is possible that software developers will become subject to more frequent infringement claims 
we have in the past  and currently continue to receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their patents or other proprietary rights 
it is possible that such claims will be asserted in the future 
in addition  to the extent we acquire other technologies  whether directly from third parties or through acquisitions of other companies  we face the possibility that such intellectual property will be found to infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others 
for example  a trademark infringement and dilution case filed in against nen  which we acquired in april  resulted in a multi million dollar judgment against nen and an injunction against nen s use of the trade name neon 
the action was settled in september for a lesser amount as well as certain other concessions 
regardless of whether these claims have merit  they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle  and can harm the company s business and reputation 
we do not believe our products infringe any third party patents or proprietary rights  but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims or findings of infringement in the future 
changes in management  human resources in recent years  we have added to our executive management team 
for example  in january  thomas volk joined the company as executive vice president  infrastructure platform group  and was recently named executive vice president  worldwide field organization to replace michael bealmear who resigned the position in february at the same time  steven m 
capelli was named senior vice president  worldwide partner group  and billy ho  formerly senior vice president and general manager of ebd  became senior vice president and general manager  oem partner sales 
in june  pamela j 
george resigned as senior vice president of corporate marketing  and was replaced by marty beard  who was named senior vice president  corporate development and corporate marketing 
in july  eric l 
miles resigned as senior vice president  business intelligence division 
richard moore  who was named president of ffi in august  joined the company in july as senior vice president and general manager of the v business group 
in october  billy ho replaced george f 
rick adam  former ceo of nen  as senior vice president and general manager of ebd 
further changes involving executives and managers resulting from acquisitions  mergers and other events could increase the current rate of employee turnover  particularly in consulting  engineering and sales 
in february  jack e 
sum  a former partner of pricewaterhousecoopers  became a company director 
further changes in our board membership could affect the company s current strategic plans or business vision 
additionally  our inability to hire and retain qualified technical  managerial  sales and other employees could affect our product development and sales efforts  other aspects of our operations  and our financial results 
competition for highly skilled personnel in the software industry is typically intense 
our financial and stock price performance relative to the companies with whom we compete for employees  and the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  could also impact the degree of future employee turnover 
acquisitions and strategic relationships we regularly explore possible acquisitions and other strategic ventures to expand and enhance our business 
we have recently acquired or invested in a number of companies and formed certain strategic relationships  and will likely continue to do so in the future 
for example  in february we completed our acquisition of 
table of contents avantgo  inc  a leading provider of mobile enterprise software  which was merged into ias at the end of in april  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of onepage  inc  a leading provider of technology and applications for building the information components portlets of corporate  consumer and wireless portals 
during  we acquired nen  a developer of enterprise application integration software  as well as our distributor in denmark 
during  we acquired certain assets of our distributor in mexico  and the stock of home financial network  inc now ffi 
we may not achieve the desired benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
for example  we may be unable to successfully assimilate an acquired company s management team  business infrastructure  company culture  or other important factors 
also  dedication of additional resources to handle these integration tasks could temporarily divert attention from other important business 
such acquisitions could also result in costs  liabilities  or additional expenses that could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
with respect to our investments in other companies  we may not realize a return on our investments  or the value of our investments may decline if the businesses in which we invest are not successful
