us domestic package operations compared to us domestic package revenue increased billion  or  for the year  which was driven by a increase in average daily package volume and a increase in revenue per piece 
ground volume increased by in  reversing a decline in  reflecting the improving us economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of the volume for our ups next day air products increased by during the year  driven by double digit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during the increase in us domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year 
in the third and fourth quarters of  total us domestic average daily package volume increased and  respectively 
the overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in january  with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below 
the decline in revenue per piece for the next day air products  and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products  was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products 

table of contents on january   we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential surcharge increased to over the commercial ground rate 
the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain zip codes increased to

based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge increased to in from in  resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of million 
effective in  we have discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service  while a new indexed surcharge is being applied to our next day air and deferred products 
this new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
this change will have a negative impact on revenue for our ground products  while having a beneficial impact on revenue for our next day air and deferred products 
us domestic package operating profit declined million  or  primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses discussed further below under the section titled operating expenses and operating margin 
us domestic package operating profit increased in the third quarter and decreased by in the fourth quarter 
however  in the fourth quarter of  us domestic package operating profit benefited from a million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
without the vacation related credit in the results  fourth quarter operating profit would have increased and the decline for the year ending december  would have been million  or 
compared to us domestic package revenue decreased million  or  for the year 
this decrease was driven by a decrease in average daily package volume  and partially offset by a increase in revenue per piece 
the decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors prior to the agreement reached on a new six year contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters  combined with the continued weakness in the us economy 
the decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the july  expiration date of the previous contract 
on january   we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries

in  we recorded a credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  which benefited the us domestic package segment by million 
international package operations compared to international package revenue improved million  or  for the year due primarily to the volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements  a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency 
revenue increased million during the year due to currency fluctuations 
export volume increased throughout the world  with asia pacific  canada  and the americas showing double digit export volume growth  and us and european export volume increasing slightly over 
european export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the euro and the weak european economy 
domestic volume increased for the year  which reverses a decline from the previous year  and was also negatively affected by the weak european economy 
export revenue per piece increased for the year currency adjusted  due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management 
in total  international average daily package volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 
the decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the americas 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million for the year  million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations 
this increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously 
in  international operating profit benefited from an million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
compared to for the year ended december   international package revenue improved million  or currency adjusted  due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements

non package operations compared to non package revenue increased million  or  for the year 
ups supply chain solutions  which comprises our former ups freight services and ups logistics group businesses  increased revenue by during the year 
this increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses  with international revenues growing faster than in the us  partially as a result of favorable 
table of contents currency fluctuations 
favorable currency fluctuations accounted for million of the increase in revenue 
freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate  which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in as a result of the work disruption at us west coast ports 
the remainder of our non package operations  which includes mail boxes etc 
the franchisor of mail boxes etc 
and the ups store  ups capital corp  our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business  increased revenue by for the year  primarily due to increased franchise revenue at mail boxes etc 
and strong results from our mail innovations unit 
non package operating profit increased million  or  for the year 
this increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our supply chain solutions unit  which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program 
non package operating profit in was reduced by the million restructuring charge and related expenses  and was increased by million due to the change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
non package operating profit includes million compared to million in of intersegment profit  with a corresponding amount of operating expense  which reduces operating profit  in the us domestic package segment 
during  we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by million  or per diluted share 
the gain consisted of a pre tax loss of million recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment  and a tax benefit of million recognized in conjunction with the sale 
the tax benefit exceeds the pre tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes 
consequently  our tax basis was greater than our book basis  thus producing the tax benefit described above 
also during  we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share  which is recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment 
the operating results of both the mail technologies unit and the aviation technologies unit were previously included in our non package segment  and were not material to non package operating results in any of the periods presented 
compared to non package revenue increased million  or during of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining was due to organic growth 
ups supply chain solutions revenue was up million  or  for the year  much of which was due to having a full year of revenue from fritz companies inc  which we acquired in may  and other acquisitions 
revenue growth at supply chain solutions was hindered by the sale of the fedex brokerage business in march excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions  ups supply chain solutions would have reported revenue growth of approximately during non package operating profit decreased by million  or  for the year

non package operating profit includes million in compared to million in of intersegment profit  with a corresponding amount of operating expense  which reduces operating profit  in the us domestic package segment 
operating expenses and operating margin compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non package segments 
compensation and 
table of contents benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled million in  a increase over  primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas for stock based compensation awards 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year  largely due to a increase in occupancy costs  a increase in fuel expense  and smaller increases in purchased transportation  repairs and maintenance  and depreciation and amortization 
other operating expenses in were affected by the million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations into our ups supply chain solutions unit 
the growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities  higher real estate taxes  and weather related increases in natural gas and utilities expense 
the fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in  somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage 
the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and supply chain solutions businesses 
the growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft  the completion of facilities projects including ups worldport  and increased amortization of capitalized software 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle  aircraft  and equipment maintenance expense 
the increase in other expenses was due to a million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of boeing and dc aircraft from service 
of the total million impairment charge  million impacted the us domestic package segment and million impacted the international package segment 
our operating margin  defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in this increase is due to the growth in operating margin in our international package and non package segments  which benefited from the revenue increases described previously

in  other operating expenses were reduced by million for compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
the non package segment accounted for million of the million total increase in operating expenses 
this was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of our 
table of contents consolidated operating margin  defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue  remained at during and investment income interest expense compared to the decrease in investment income of million in is primarily due to a million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors  including the extent and duration to which a security s fair value has been less than its cost  overall economic and market conditions  and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer 
during the first quarter of  after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets  we recognized an impairment charge of million  primarily related to our investment in s p equity portfolios 
the million decline in interest expense in was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding  lower interest rates on variable rate debt  and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps 
compared to the decrease in investment income of million for is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment in net income and earnings per share compared to net income for was billion  a decrease of million from the billion achieved in  resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from in to in net income in was favorably impacted by million after tax per diluted share resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability  and by million after tax per diluted share from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for non union employees

in addition  income tax expense was reduced by million per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the internal revenue service during the first quarter  by million per diluted share due to a tax contingency accrual adjustment resulting from a favorable ruling on the tax treatment for jet engine maintenance costs during the third quarter  and by million per share due to a lower effective state tax rate in the fourth quarter

in november  we announced rate increases  which took effect on january  the overall impact is in line with previous years rate increases 
we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential surcharge increased to over the commercial ground rate 
an additional delivery area surcharge of was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain zip codes 
rates for ups hundredweight increased

rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
in addition  we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service  while a new index is being applied to our next day air  deferred products  and international services 
this new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
the index for shipments originating in europe will be based on the rotterdam ara spot price of kerosene type jet fuel 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  and billion in  and  respectively 
the primary reason for these declines has been the slowing growth of our finance receivables portfolio  and the lack of business acquisitions during and capital expenditures represent the primary use of cash in investing activities  as follows in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately billion in these expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software 
we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  and billion in  and  respectively 
our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repay long term debt  repurchase stock  and pay dividends 
during  we repaid over billion in debt  primarily consisting of million of commercial paper  million in cash convertible notes  and million in repayments of ups notes 
issuances of debt primarily consisted of ups notes 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
in august  a total of billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program 
as of december   million of this authorization was available for future share repurchases 
we repurchased a total of million of common stock in we increased our cash dividends per share to in from in  resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to billion from million 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
in february  the board of directors declared a per share dividend  which represents a increase over the previous quarterly dividend 
the dividend is payable on march  to shareowners of record on february  sources of credit we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion 
approximately million was outstanding under these programs as of december   with an average interest rate of 
the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
in addition  we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to million 
no amounts were outstanding under this program at december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring on april  and the other on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december  we also maintain a billion european medium term note program 
under this program  we may issue notes from time to time  denominated in a variety of currencies 
no amounts were outstanding under this program at december  in august  we filed a billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states 
there was approximately million issued under this shelf registration statement at december   all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 
commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases  capital leases  debt obligations  and purchase commitments 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow 
table of contents from operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions capitalized operating debt purchase year leases leases principal commitments after total we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases  through contingencies on august  the united states tax court tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd  a bermuda company that had reinsured ev insurance purchased by our customers beginning in  and that we were liable for additional tax for the and tax years 
the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to through on june   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision 
in january  we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance 
under the terms of settlement  we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately million  additions to tax of million and related interest 
the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued 
as a result  we recorded income  before taxes  of billion million after tax during the fourth quarter of the refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years 
the irs has proposed adjustments  unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above  regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses  the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary  the treatment of certain income  and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the through tax years 
the proposed adjustments would result in million of additional income tax 
the irs has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from through that report proposes adjustments that would result in million in additional income tax 
the irs s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest 
we believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote 
in november  the irs issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years through that report proposes adjustments that would result in million in additional income tax 
for the through tax years  unpaid interest on these adjustments through december  could aggregate up to approximately million  after the benefit of related tax deductions 
we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues 
specifically  we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants 
the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years through we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we are named as a defendant in twenty three pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for excess value ev insurance in connection with package shipments since based on state and federal tort  contract and statutory claims  these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer  we failed to provide promised ev insurance  we acted 
table of contents as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations  and the price for ev insurance was excessive 
these actions all were filed after the august  united states tax court decision  in which the tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd  a bermuda company that had reinsured ev insurance purchased by our customers beginning in  and that we were liable for additional tax for the and tax years 
on june   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision 
in january  we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues relating to ev package insurance 
these twenty three cases have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding mdl proceeding in federal court in new york 
in addition to the cases in which ups is named as a defendant  there also is an action  smith v 
mail boxes etc  against mail boxes etc 
and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc 
centers 
this case also has been consolidated into the mdl proceeding 
while expressly denying any and all liability  the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding 
the proposed settlement requires several steps before it becomes final  including notice to the settlement class  and obtaining final court approval 
if the proposed settlement becomes final  we would provide to qualifying settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs attorneys fees  the total amount of which will be determined by the court 
the ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors 
we do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition  we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could result in higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans 
due to the events of september   increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming  however  we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions  including self insuring certain risks  to mitigate the expense increase 
as of december   we had approximately  employees of our total employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which became amendable january  negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board 
our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which becomes amendable on november  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
these agreements run through july  market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do 
table of contents not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are used in the transportation of packages 
additionally  we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products  primarily natural gas and electricity  used in our operating facilities throughout the world 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound sterling 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual 
table of contents interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
as described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we have certain investments in debt auction rate  and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables  that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately million at both december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred 
this statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after january  as discussed in note  we implemented a restructuring program involving the business unit integration of our freight services and logistics group operations in the fourth quarter of as this restructuring program was initiated in  we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
therefore  the adoption of fas on january  had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of million  which is classified in other operating expenses 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor 
fin also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts 
the disclosure provisions of fin were effective for financial statements ending after decem 
table of contents ber   while the recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin was not material to our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  to address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet 
in addition to numerous fasb staff positions written to clarify and improve the application of fin  the fasb recently announced a deferral for certain entities  and an amendment to fin entitled fasb interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest resulting from arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting interests 
fin defines the term variable interest entity and is based on the premise that if a business enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of its expected residual returns  that enterprise has a controlling financial interest  and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest entity 
as of december   we have adopted fin  and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of operations or financial condition 
on july   we adopted fasb statement no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas amends fas for certain decisions made by the fasb as part of the derivatives implementation group process 
fas also amends fas to incorporate clarifications of the definition of a derivative

on july   we adopted fasb statement no 
accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas

 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits fas 
the revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
as revised  fas is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december   and we have included these disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 

table of contents goodwill impairment the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas in june as a result of the issuance of this new standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subjected to annual impairment testing 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units 
upon adoption of fas  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million per diluted share  as of january   related to our mail technologies business 
the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business 
in conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million related to our mail technologies business  resulting in total goodwill impairment of million for our annual impairment test performed in resulted in no goodwill impairment 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion 
self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
pension and postretirement medical benefits the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
the impact of decreasing the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets to and the decrease in the discount rate to  combined with other factors such as the additional fundings which occurred during  will increase our pension plan expense by approximately million in financial instruments as discussed in notes    and to our consolidated financial statements  and in the market risk section of this report  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had approximately billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

table of contents in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
when appropriate  we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing and dc aircraft 
as a result  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft 
this charge is classified in the caption other expenses within other operating expenses see note 
ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate  both in the united states and internationally 
our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks 
the impact of competition on a local  regional  national and international basis 
our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations  various motor carriers  express companies  freight forwarders  air couriers and others 
our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates 
the impact of complex and stringent aviation  transportation  environmental  labor  employment and other governmental laws and regulations  and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of september  our failure to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees 
such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs  and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service 
we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service 
the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations possible disruptions of supplies  or an increase in the prices  of gasoline and fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors 
we require significant
