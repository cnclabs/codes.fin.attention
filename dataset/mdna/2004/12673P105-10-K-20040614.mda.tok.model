item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide a more complete understanding of our financial condition  change in financial condition  cash flow  liquidity  and results of operations 
as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  in fiscal year we divested a subsidiary  accpac international  inc accpac 
the assets  liabilities  results of operations  and cash flow of accpac have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented prior to the sale of accpac in march the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes the effect of the discontinued operation 
nature of business as described in greater detail in item  business  we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors  resellers  and vars 
we generate revenue from the following sources license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis  maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements  and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation  consulting  and education services 
the timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement  based on its duration and specific terms 
under our business model  we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements 
we also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change  which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee 
as a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades  we are required under gaap to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis also known as ratably over the license term 
we believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement improves the predictability of our revenue streams and more accurately reflects the earnings process 
under agreements entered into prior to october the prior business model  and as is common practice in the software industry  we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades 
as a result  for most license agreements entered into prior to october  we were required under gaap to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed 
under our business model  the portion of the license revenue that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription revenue 
deferred subscription revenue is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements 
when recognized  this revenue is reported on the subscription revenue line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
if a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue  the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled deferred subscription revenue collected on our consolidated balance sheets 
not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our business model  which has created what we refer to as a transition period  during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal 
during the transition period  we are building deferred subscription revenue  from which subscription revenue will be amortized 
total deferred subscription revenue  and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it  is expected to increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model  sell additional products and capacity to existing customers as well as enter into new contracts with new customers 
we expect that the majority of contracts executed under the prior business model will be transitioned to our business model by the end of fiscal year while the impact of changing from an up front revenue recognition model to our business model initially reduced our reported revenue  we generally did not change our cost structure 
therefore  we have primarily experienced losses since we introduced our business model 
we expect that our revenues will continue to increase at a greater rate than our expenses  and we expect to return to profitability during fiscal year under both the prior business model and current business model  customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement 
we refer to these payments as installment payments 
while the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition  in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers 
as a result  our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years 
we do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as we complete this transition 

table of contents performance indicators management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition 
each provides a measurement of the performance of our business model and how well we are executing our plan 
our subscription based business model is unique among our competitors in the software industry  and during the transition period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors 
management focuses on period over period improvement when reviewing our performance indicators 
the following is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review our performance percent for the year ended march  change change dollars in millions subscription revenue total revenue subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue new deferred subscription revenue weighted average license agreement duration in years cash from continuing operations loss from continuing operations percent as of march  change change dollars in millions total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities total debt analyses of our performance indicators  including general trends  can be found in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this md a 
the performance indicators which we believe are unique to us are defined below 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue 
subscription revenue also includes revenue earned from monthly licenses 
the larger the ratio of subscription revenue to total revenue  the more predictable our revenue streams become 
a change in subscription revenue is correlated with a change in deferred subscription revenue  and therefore  with a constant weighted average life  an increase in deferred subscription revenue will also increase subscription revenue 
new deferred subscription revenue new deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value contract value of software licenses sold in the current period by our direct sales force 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  we expect to offer more flexible license terms to our channel partners which will necessitate ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our channel business 
ratable recognition of revenue for the channel license business will be consistent with our overall business model and will be reported on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
previously  such channel license revenue was recorded on a sell through basis and was reported on the software fees and other line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to this expected change  new deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with license agreements for maintenance only agreements  channel sales  and professional service arrangements 
new deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect from our customers 
this amount is recorded into subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term 
these license agreements represent binding payment commitments from customers over periods up to three years 
new deferred subscription revenue is sometimes referred to as bookings and is used by management as a gauge of the level of activity in a particular quarter 
our bookings typically increase in each consecutive quarter  with the fourth fiscal quarter being the strongest 

table of contents weighted average license agreement duration in years the weighted average license agreement duration in years represents the sum of the duration of all software licenses executed during a fiscal year  weighted by each individual software license s contract value 
the annual weighted average duration of and years for the fiscal years and  respectively  were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and weighted average durations in years  respectively fiscal year fiscal year weighted weighted new deferred average new deferred average subscription duration subscription duration revenue in years revenue in years dollars in millions fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter we believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years  which is lower than the historical duration of our license agreements  increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change 
we also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by the company to each of our customers 
results of operations revenue the following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year percentage percentage percentage of of percentage of of total dollar total dollar revenue change revenue change revenue subscription revenue software fees and other maintenance financing fees professional services total revenue total revenue total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the fiscal year ended march   to billion 
this increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our business model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year this transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year  partially offset by an anticipated decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below 
professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased million for fiscal year as described below 
in addition  in fiscal year  there was a positive impact to revenue of million compared to fiscal year due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
continued cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the fiscal year ended march   to billion 
this increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our business model 
professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased million for fiscal year as described below 

table of contents in addition  in fiscal year  there was a positive impact to revenue of million compared to fiscal year due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
this foreign exchange rate impact was fully offset by the impact of the sale of our interbiz unit in april  which had contributed approximately million of revenue in fiscal year cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers associated with weak conditions in the overall economy and the it industry adversely impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year although the transition to our business model and weaker economic conditions impacted revenue  quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on such decrease is not determinable 
subscription revenue subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from fiscal year  to billion 
subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our business model 
many of the licenses recorded between october  when our business model was implemented  and the end of fiscal year continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly  ratable basis 
as a result  subscription revenue for fiscal year includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year  as well as bookings recorded between october and the end of fiscal year this is the primary reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year during fiscal years and  we added new bookings  or new deferred subscription revenue  of billion and billion  respectively 
the weighted average life of license agreements executed under our business model was approximately years for the fiscal years ending march  and thus  annualized deferred subscription revenue  which represents the total value of all new software license agreements signed during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period  increased approximately million  or  for fiscal year over the prior fiscal year to million 
subscription revenue also increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our business model 
under the prior business model  maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
under the business model  maintenance bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable 
subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the prior fiscal year to billion 
similar to the increase in fiscal year  the increase was primarily due to our transition to our business model that began in the third quarter of fiscal year fiscal year included subscription revenue earned from software license agreements that renewed during fiscal year these license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year during fiscal years and  we added new deferred subscription revenue of billion and billion  respectively 
software fees and other software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue and royalties related to distribution and oem partners 
revenue related to distribution partners and oems is sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   software fees and other revenue decreased million from the fiscal year ended march   to million 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amount of channel sales recognized as maintenance which is deferred of approximately million over the prior fiscal year period 
this deferred maintenance will be amortized into revenue over time 
the decrease in software fees and other was partially offset by an increase in the amount of indirect license revenue recorded in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year for the fiscal year ended march   software fees and other decreased million from the fiscal year ended march   to million 
the decrease was primarily due to a difficult economic and competitive environment 
maintenance as expected  maintenance revenue for fiscal years and decreased million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in maintenance revenue for both years is attributable to additional license agreements signed under our business model  where bundled maintenance revenue is included with license revenue  which is reported in the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement 
the decrease is partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not determinable 
financing fees financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model  which required up front revenue recognition 
this discount initially reduced the related 
table of contents installment accounts receivable and was referred to as unamortized discounts 
the related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and reported as financing fees 
under our business model  additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded  since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms 
as expected  for fiscal years and  financing fees decreased million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years 
professional services professional services revenue for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was a result of the weak spending environment that affected the it service sector in general  as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products 
our professional services headcount was reduced by approximately as a result of the creation of our ca technology services group in april quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable 
professional services revenue for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was partially attributable to the divestiture of our interbiz unit in april  which generated approximately million of professional services revenue in fiscal year the decrease was also a result of the weak spending environment that affected the it service sector in general  as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products 
quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable 
total revenue by geography fiscal year fiscal year dollars in millions change change united states international international revenue increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million for fiscal year over fiscal year  which was primarily caused by the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
the increase was also a result of increased contract bookings in prior periods associated with our european business 
despite an increase in fiscal year of combined subscription  maintenance  and financing revenue in the united states of approximately million  compared to fiscal year  total revenue in the united states declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other  for the reasons described above 
international revenue increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year results in fiscal year included our interbiz operations  which we divested in april those operations contributed approximately million and million of revenue in fiscal year from the united states and international regions  respectively 
the increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to an improvement in our business in europe and asia as well as the million positive impact due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
despite an increase in fiscal year of combined subscription  maintenance  and financing revenue in the united states of million  compared to fiscal year  total revenue in the united states declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other  for the reasons described above 
price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years   or 
table of contents expenses the following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year percentage percentage percentage of of percentage of of total dollar total dollar revenue change revenue change operating expenses amortization of capitalized software costs cost of professional services selling  general  and administrative product development and enhancements commission and royalties depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill impairment other gains expenses  net shareholder litigation settlement and investigation charge na total operating expenses interest expense  net note amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers 
cost of professional services for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to the reduction in professional services engagements as well as a reduction in personnel costs resulting from efficiencies associated with the combination of our pre sales and post sales professional services organizations in fiscal year cost of professional services for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to billion 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the provision of doubtful accounts of million 
this decrease is a result of how we account for contractual commitments under the business model 
amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue  resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet 
in addition  under the business model  customer payments are often received prior to revenue recognition 
each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts 
the decrease in sg a was partially offset by a million expense for severance and other termination benefits in connection with the reorganization of the us channel sales organization and the creation of ca technology services in april  as well as other increases in personnel and related costs 
in addition  we incurred legal and other professional service expenses associated with the investigations being conducted by the audit committee  the sec  and the us attorney s office of approximately million  which represents an increase of approximately million from the prior fiscal year 
effective april   we began charging to expense the computed value of all newly granted stock based compensation over the vesting period 
the computed fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the fair value based methodology under sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
the total stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year was approximately million 
see note  accounting for stock based compensation for additional information 

table of contents sg a expenses for fiscal year decreased million compared to fiscal year to billion 
the decrease was attributable to our emphasis on cost control measures  including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs 
during fiscal year  we had an average of approximately  employees  which represented a decrease of approximately  employees from the fiscal year average of  employees 
a portion of the personnel costs associated with the decrease in employees impacted other line items 
the reduction in headcount consisted of a reduction in workforce of approximately employees in october  approximately employees from the divestiture of certain assets of our interbiz operations in april  and approximately employees from the divestiture of our banking product group in october this reduction was partially offset by headcount additions in fiscal year primarily due to the opening of a new call center for telemarketing efforts 
our interbiz unit contributed approximately million of sg a expenses in fiscal year  the majority of which were personnel costs 
the decrease in sg a expenses was also attributable to a reduction of bad debt expense of million related to ongoing operations and million of bad debt expense related to interbiz 
this reduction reflects a decrease in installment accounts receivable related to the prior business model 
product development and enhancements for fiscal year  product development and enhancement expenditures  also referred to as research and development  increased million compared to fiscal year to million 
research and development expenditures were approximately and of total revenue in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless  web services and on demand computing  as well as a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was primarily a result of a general decrease in operating expenditures  however  we continued to invest in product development and enhancements such as emerging technologies and a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
commissions and royalties commissions and royalties for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the increase was partially offset by a million reduction in royalties to third parties  as we continue to focus on internal product development and enhancements 
commissions and royalties for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to an million reduction in royalties paid to third parties resulting from continued emphasis on internal product development and enhancements 
this decrease was also due to the reduction in sales and related commission expenses associated with the divestiture of certain assets of our interbiz unit 
that unit contributed approximately million of such expenses in fiscal year depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized 
depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was primarily a result of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in april under sfas no 
 a non amortization fair value based impairment approach is used to account for goodwill and certain intangible assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized million and million of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset  respectively  during fiscal year goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual goodwill impairment review under sfas no 
and determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for additional information about our annual review process 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we performed our annual impairment review 
as a result of the review  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our professional services organization 
the impairment was attributable to our lower than expected results and our projected performance 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the charge related to the sale of interbiz in april the million charge consisted of a million goodwill impairment charge recorded on the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements

impairment of capitalized software shareholder litigation settlement and investigation charge in august  we announced the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to the stockholder and derivative actions 
approval of the federal court was granted in december under the settlement  we agreed to issue a total of up to million shares of common stock to the shareholders represented in the three class action lawsuits  including payment of attorneys fees 
in january  approximately million settlement shares were issued along with approximately million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses 
in march  approximately  settlement shares were issued to participants and beneficiaries of the cash plan 
the remaining million settlement shares  less any additional administrative expenses  will be issued to class members in the stockholder class action lawsuits upon completion of the claims administration process 
at the time of the distribution to the class members  if the price of our common stock is below per share  a portion of the remaining settlement shares currently up to million shares will be distributed to the class members in cash at the price of per share 
therefore  as of march   our maximum cash distribution would have been approximately million 
we expect to issue the balance of the shares or corresponding amounts of cash in our second quarter of fiscal year  or at such time as the claims administration process has been completed 
an initial estimate for the value of the shareholder litigation settlement was established on august   and until all settlement shares are issued  the projected impact will be reviewed quarterly and the expense adjusted accordingly 
the related liability is reflected on the other current liabilities line item on the consolidated balance sheets 
the chart below summarizes the new york stock exchange nyse closing price of our common stock and the estimated value of the shareholder litigation settlement since the initial estimate was established 
shareholder nyse closing litigation settlement stock price estimated value in millions march  december  september  august  we also recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year associated with the pending investigation by the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york and the staff of the northeast regional office of the sec 
the charge was based on an initial offer we made to the government in connection with recent settlement discussions associated with the investigation 
we cannot predict the timing or outcome of the government investigation or the amount of any fine or penalty  which may be significant  that may be imposed

interest expense  net interest expense  net for fiscal year decreased million as compared to fiscal year to million 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average debt outstanding  which resulted in a million decrease in interest expense  a reduction in the weighted average interest rate  which resulted in a million decrease in interest expense  and accelerated amortization of financing fees in the third quarter of fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by a million gain related to the early retirement of a portion of outstanding debt in fiscal year 
table of contents net interest expense for fiscal year decreased million as compared to fiscal year to million 
of the change  million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding  million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate  and million was the result of gains from the early retirement of portions of our outstanding debt in fiscal year operating margins for fiscal year  our pretax loss from continuing operations was million as compared to a pretax loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal year the decrease in pretax loss was primarily related to an increase in revenue and a decrease in bad debt expense as noted above  partially offset by the shareholder litigation settlement expense and investigation charge of million recorded in fiscal year income tax benefit our effective tax benefit from continuing operations was approximately   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
selected quarterly information we have amended our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods in the fiscal year ended march  the primary purpose of the restatement is to correct the method we used to account for subscription revenue associated with business model contracts that replaced existing business model contracts 
previously  the remaining deferred subscription revenue balance associated with the contract that was being replaced was amortized over the term of the original contract 
in accordance with sop  the correct  and revised  method amortizes the remaining deferred subscription revenue balance over the term of the new contract 
the adjustments decreased revenue by million  million  and million for the first  second and third quarters  respectively  of the fiscal year ended march  and increased deferred subscription revenue by a cumulative amount of approximately million 
such deferred subscription revenue will be recognized in subsequent periods

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled billion on march   an increase of million from the march  balance of billion 
cash generated from continuing operating activities for fiscal year was billion  a decrease of million from the prior year s cash from continuing operations of billion 
cash generated from continuing operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in taxes paid of approximately million and legal settlement payments of approximately million 
the increase in taxes paid during fiscal year was primarily the result of the timing of estimated tax payments and were made prior to the internal revenue service revenue procedure discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the 
table of contents reduction in cash generated from continuing operating activities was partially offset by a reduction of approximately million in interest payments 

table of contents during fiscal year  we used existing cash balances and cash from operations to repay approximately million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately million in fiscal year as of march  and  our debt arrangements consisted of the following debt arrangements maximum outstanding maximum outstanding in millions available balance available balance revolving credit facility expired in may revolving credit facility expires january commercial paper senior notes due april senior notes due april senior notes due april convertible senior notes due march senior notes due april convertible senior notes due december international line of credit other total at march   we had billion in debt and billion in cash and marketable securities 
our net debt position was  therefore  approximately million 
we expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to pay our debt balances as they mature  and  based on historical precedent  we expect to continue to generate annual cash flow from operations in excess of billion 
we do not believe that it will be necessary for us to access the capital markets to satisfy our debt obligations 
we expect to renew our revolving credit facility prior to its expiration in january  and we have an option to apply for renewal of the facility for an additional year 
the continuing government investigations have not materially hindered our access to the capital markets  as evidenced by our successful convertible bond offerings in march and december our future access to the capital markets  however  could be materially impacted as a result of the conclusion of the government investigation 
in addition  the conclusion of the government investigation could affect our ability to renew our revolving credit facility or could impact the pricing of a new revolving credit facility

the consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations of the companies since the effective dates of the acquisitions 
we pre fund contributions to our broad based  employee defined contribution retirement plan annually each march 
pre funded contributions totaled million in each of the years ended march  and peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year totaled approximately billion  with a weighted average interest rate of capital resource requirements as of march  consisted of lease obligations for office space  equipment  mortgage or loan obligations  and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions 
see contractual obligations and commitments for additional information 
it is expected that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets  and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
we expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue 
off balance sheet arrangements we have commitments to invest approximately million in connection with joint venture agreements 
in prior fiscal years  we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to an external third party subject to certain 
table of contents recourse provisions 
the amounts subject to recourse approximated million and million as of march  and  respectively 
other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above  we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and  accordingly  off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited 
contractual obligations and commitments we have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services 
these contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
in accordance with current accounting rules  the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at march  and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
in addition  the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations inclusive of interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling million expected to be received in the following periods million less than year  million years  million years  and million more than years 
other long term liabilities primarily relate to operating expenses associated with operating lease obligations 
as of march   we have no material capital lease obligations  either individually or in the aggregate 
subsequent events the following significant events have occurred subsequent to march  on april   jeff clarke was named chief financial officer 
on april   we announced that jeff clarke s role would be expanded to include the role of chief operating officer 
on april   we terminated the employment of steven woghin  our former general counsel 
we are actively conducting a search for a new general counsel 
on april   we terminated the employment of nine employees in the legal and finance departments as a result of issues raised during the independent investigation by the audit committee of our board of directors into past accounting practices 
on april   sanjay kumar stepped down as chairman and ceo and resigned from our board of directors 
at that time mr 
kumar was named chief software architect 
mr 
kumar subsequently resigned from the company 
his resignation will be effective june  on april   we named kenneth d 
cron  an independent director  interim chief executive officer 
mr 
cron joined our board of directors in on april   as a result of the independent investigation by the audit committee  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a current report on form k restating certain financial data for the company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended march  and on april   we announced that gregory w 
corgan had been appointed executive vice president of worldwide sales  succeeding stephen richards  who resigned from his position and was relieved of all duties in april  and is leaving the company at the end of june outlook for fiscal year the outlook for the overall economy and the it environment  complicated by international conflicts  continues to be difficult to predict 
the outlook for our fiscal year is premised on the assumption that there will be limited to 
table of contents modest improvement in the current economic and it environments 
we also believe that customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases 
our preliminary outlook for fiscal year is to generate revenue in the range of billion to billion  an increase of between to  and earnings per share in the range of to 

table of contents we expect that subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue  as well as annualized deferred subscription revenue  should continue to increase during fiscal year for the same reasons as described in results of operations for the fiscal year increase  cash generated from operations will exceed billion  which may be reduced by any potential fine or penalty  which may be significant  related to the government investigation  our weighted average license agreement duration will continue to be approximately years  the level of business from distribution and oem partners for fiscal year should remain steady or increase slightly from that of fiscal year as new products are brought to market  as previously disclosed  the company will be offering more flexible licensing terms to its channel partners and beginning july   we will account for this channel revenue on a subscription  or ratable  basis 
we expect that the impact from this change will have the effect of decreasing fiscal total revenue by approximately million  with an associated impact on earnings of approximately per share compared to our previous model 
this has been factored into our outlook above  maintenance revenue as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations should continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue previously recorded under our prior business model is amortized over the term of the original license agreement  financing fees will continue to decrease as amounts earned from license agreements under our prior business model are amortized over the term of the original license agreement  the level of professional service engagements for fiscal year should increase slightly from fiscal year  since the formation of the ca technology services organization in april should continue to result in increased efficiency in our services organization  total sg a expense for fiscal year will increase approximately due to our expected efforts to expand our international presence  particularly in asia  open up new distribution call centers  and expand our sales and marketing efforts  we will incur approximately million in stock based compensation charges  representing million relating to our adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
and million of restricted stock expense we incurred approximately million of pre tax total stock based compensation charges in fiscal year  product development and enhancement expenditures should increase slightly and continue to constitute a significant portion of total operating expenses in fiscal year  we will renew our revolving credit facility prior to its expiration on january   our debt level should remain at approximately billion in fiscal year since there are no scheduled payments due in fiscal year  however  we may elect to redeem the million convertible senior notes at any time after march   at prices declining to par  and we expect to pay the million senior notes when they come due in april  and the effective tax rate for fiscal year should be approximately 
as a result of a new irs revenue procedure refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  we expect that taxes paid will be lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use 
many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment  either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies are complex and require a high degree of judgment and are therefore critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the following primary sources licensing software products  providing customer technical support referred to as maintenance  and providing professional services  such as consulting and education 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in accordance with sop  we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  license agreement terms 
table of contents are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions 
an acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software 
if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision  we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or  if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement  the expiration of the acceptance period 
under our business model  software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that  among other things  allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee 
these agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four sop recognition criteria noted above 
for license agreements signed prior to october the prior business model  once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met  software license fees were recognized as revenue up front  and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license 
maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model  and stand alone maintenance agreements 
under the prior business model  maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement 
the maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term 
many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and  therefore  continue to amortize 
this amortization is recorded to the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the deferred maintenance portion  which was optional to the customer  was determined using its fair value based on annual  fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement 
for license agreements entered into under our current business model  maintenance and license fees continue to be combined  however  the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term 
we report such combined fees on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
we record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements 
maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement 
the deferred maintenance revenue line item on our consolidated balance sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered 
revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of sop  which in most cases is as the services are performed 
revenues from professional services sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized over the life of the related software transaction 
if it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed 
revenue from sales to distributors  resellers  and vars is recognized when all four of the sop revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers 
this is commonly referred to as the sell through method 
we have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed upon receipt of cash payment 
our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products 
such warranties are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements  we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on  among other things  allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
in most cases  in the event of an infringement claim  we retain the right to i procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product  ii replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality  or iii if neither i nor ii can be reasonably achieved  we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid 
such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer 

table of contents accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
in developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts  we rely on several factors  including historical information  such as general collection history of multiyear software agreements  current customer information events  such as extended delinquency  requests for restructuring  and filing for bankruptcy  results of analytical analysis of both historical and current data  and the overall economic environment 
the allowance is comprised of two components a specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when  based on current information  we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer  and b a general allowance for all other receivables 
we expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected 
under our business model  amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue unearned revenue related to these amounts  resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet 
therefore  less of an allowance for doubtful accounts is required 
income taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes known as temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
as of march   our deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  totaled million 
realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are a result of acquisition expenses  such as duplicate facility costs  employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid  foreign net operating losses nols and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with gaap 
the nols expire between and an additional valuation allowance of million was established in fiscal year for certain foreign nols and other deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized 
future results may vary from these estimates 
at this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements 
goodwill  capitalized software products  and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we performed our annual assessment for fiscal year and concluded that there were no impairments to record 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

table of contents determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test  is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flow  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of capitalized software products  both purchased software and internally developed software  and other intangible assets  are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
the facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date 
it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or  if such an impairment were to occur  the magnitude thereof 
in fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to internally developed capitalized software assets 
this amount was included in the other gains expenses  net line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation we currently maintain stock option plans and restricted stock awards 
prior to april   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations 
effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
we selected the prospective method to transition to the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation expense 
under the prospective method  we recognize compensation expense related to all stock awards granted after march  we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years 
the following table sets forth the various estimated effects on future earnings per share as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
using the fair market value of our stock as of march  base price 
for purposes of this table  we have assumed that options covering million shares are awarded in the last quarter of each fiscal year  which is consistent with fiscal year  but may not be indicative of future option grants 
we have assumed million in contributions for each offer period related to the year employee stock purchase plan 
we have assumed all other variables to be the same as those used for fiscal year  as detailed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
potential future effect on eps year ended march  assumed exercise price of stock based compensation base price below base price above base price above base price the above table provides sensitivity analysis related to the granting of stock options and the associated expense incurred over the vesting period of the option 
the assumptions used may vary significantly  which can result in a material change to the amounts presented above 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
due to the uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at 
table of contents the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims  and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
see item  legal proceedings  and note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our material legal proceedings 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
issue requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures be made for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
that are impaired at the balance sheet date  but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
we adopted eitf no 
as of march   and the required disclosures have been made see note of the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below 
any of these factors  or others  many of which are beyond our control  could negatively affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow 
operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including those listed below  which in turn could adversely affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow in the future 
demand for products and services  length of sales cycle  customer implementation of our products  magnitude of price and product competition  introduction of new hardware  general economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business  customer budgets for hardware and software  ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ability to control costs  the size of licensing transactions  reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  the results of litigation  including the government and internal investigations  ability to retain and attract qualified personnel  and reaction of customers to our business model 
any of the foregoing factors  among others  may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high  or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
as a consequence  our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow could be adversely affected 
the success of our international operations is subject to many factors 
international revenue has historically represented a significant percentage of our total worldwide revenue 
continued success in selling our products outside the united states will depend on a variety of factors  including reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  staffing key managerial positions  the ability to successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets  general economic conditions in foreign countries  political stability  trade restrictions such as tariffs  duties  or other controls affecting foreign operations  and the effects of war and terrorism 
any of the foregoing factors  among others  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we could be subject to fines  penalties  or other sanctions as a result of a joint inquiry by the sec and us attorney s office 
we have been responding to an ongoing joint inquiry being conducted by the staff of the northeast regional office of the securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york concerning certain of our accounting practices 
on january   we received a wells notice from the staff of the 
table of contents sec indicating that the staff is considering recommending that the sec bring a civil enforcement proceeding against us 
see item  legal proceedings for additional information 
we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of the investigation and other matters referred to herein  which may include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive  or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  which may be significant  suspensions or debarments from government contracts  and other remedies and sanctions  any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our credit ratings and ability to obtain financing  an adverse impact on our stock price  loss of additional senior management  the inability to attract or retain key employees  and the loss of customers 
in addition  under the law  the illegal acts of our employees may be ascribed to us 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these matters may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year associated with the pending government investigation 
this charge was based on an initial offer we made to the government in connection with settlement discussions associated with the department of justice and sec investigation 
we are subject to intense competition  and we expect to face increased competition in the future 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors  and or greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
competitors for our various products include large technology companies 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 
our competitors include large vendors of hardware or operating system software 
the widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products  or render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
furthermore  even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products  customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products 
in addition  the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as software companies seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products  as well as integrated software and hardware solutions 
this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
see item  business competition  for additional information 
we have lost senior management employees  it may be difficult to replace these employees and to attract and retain other key personnel 
in connection with the investigations described in item  legal proceedings  we have lost several members of our senior management  including our former chief executive and chief financial officers and our general counsel  as well as several other members of our finance and legal departments 
these departures have deprived us of the knowledge and skills possessed by certain of these individuals and have left us understaffed in certain areas 
although we are currently conducting searches to replace these individuals  the searches could be time consuming and expensive  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified replacements 
in addition  we may not be able to continue to attract and retain other key personnel  including highly qualified sales  consulting  technical  marketing  financial  and legal personnel 
further  integrating new management and other key personnel may be difficult and costly 
the inability to find appropriate replacements for senior management  to continue to attract and retain other personnel  and to integrate new personnel could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition  and cash flow 
certain software is licensed from third parties 
some of our products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments 
ibm  hp  sun microsystems  and microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and  in most cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  systems software  and computer hardware 
such new products could  in the future  incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products  or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of 
table of contents our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately billion of debt outstanding  consisting of unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations  convertible senior notes  and unsecured multicurrency credit facilities 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash provided from operations  and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
however  failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further 
our moody s and s p credit ratings were recently downgraded 
moody s  s p  or any other credit rating agency may further downgrade or take other negative action with respect to our credit ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings are further downgraded or other negative action is taken  we would be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under our credit agreements 
any downgrades could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
customers are still adapting to our business model 
our business model affords customers significant flexibility in licensing transactions 
for example  under our business model  we offer software licenses on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try our software products without committing to a multiyear license obligation 
transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not fully implement our software and will not enter into a long term relationship with us 
additionally  customer preference for other forms of payment upfront  annual  or monthly installments could impact the amount of cash generated from operations in any period 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position 
our future success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we protect our proprietary information through the use of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult 
unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
for example  shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  patents we have obtained may be circumvented  challenged  invalidated  or designed around by other companies 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
see item  business proprietary rights  for additional information 
we may become dependent upon large transactions 
we have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers 
as a result of the flexibility afforded by our business model  we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future  and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions 
our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources 
however  a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products or to upgrade their existing environments  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third party microcode could impact product development 
we anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers 
microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are  therefore  less flexible than other types of software 
we believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code 
however  there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

table of contents the software business is marked by easy entry and large  entrenched businesses 
many companies with whom we compete  including ibm  sun microsystems  hp  and other large computer manufacturers  have substantial resources  a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche  as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us 
additionally  these producers can bundle hardware  software  and services together  which is a disadvantage for us since we do not provide hardware and have far fewer services offerings 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle  and sap  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by us 
increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry 
additionally  many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions or displacement of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system understandable to programmers  object code  which directly controls the hardware  and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  isvs such as us were able to develop and market compatible software 
microsoft  ibm  and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
the markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow 
we have identified six product areas infrastructure management  security management  storage management  application life cycle management  data management and application development  and portal and business intelligence 
some or all of these areas may not grow  may decline in growth  or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas 
this is particularly true in newly emerging areas  such as portal and business intelligence 
a decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products  which would adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property 
investigation of these claims  whether with or without merit  can be expensive and could affect development  marketing  or shipment of our products 
as the number of software patents issued increases  it is likely that additional claims  with or without merit  will be asserted 
defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses 

table of contents most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products  foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions 
additionally  fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect our revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
acts of terrorism or war may adversely affect our business 
acts of terrorism  acts of war  and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors  resellers  and customers  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant license agreements  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions  general conditions in the software and computer industries  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  debt  and installment accounts receivable 
we have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers standard poor s single a rating and higher 
to mitigate risk  many of the securities have a maturity date within one year  and holdings of any one issuer  excluding the us government  do not exceed of the portfolio 
periodically  the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
we have shifted from a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments to substantially all fixed rate debt instruments to take advantage of historically low interest rates 
as of march   our outstanding debt approximated billion  approximately all of which is in fixed rate obligations 
if market rates were to decline  we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of march  prior to our implementation of the business model  we offered financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software solution sales 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element  which can vary with the interest rate environment 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business on a worldwide basis through branches and subsidiaries in countries 
we are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
as part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions 
in addition  we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries 
a change in all foreign currencies against the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations 
equity price risk as of march   we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy
