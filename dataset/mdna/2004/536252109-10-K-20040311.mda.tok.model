critical accounting policies and estimates lionbridge s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires lionbridge to 
table of contents make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
lionbridge periodically evaluates its estimates 
lionbridge bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
lionbridge reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee and the company s board of directors 
lionbridge s current critical accounting estimates relate to the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and the provision for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
lionbridge s revenue is derived from project by project fees and  to a lesser extent  long term service agreements 
projects are generally billed on a time and expense basis 
revenue is recognized using a percentage of completion method of accounting  based primarily on labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of management s estimate of total costs of individual projects 
the use of a percentage of completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in employee wages prices for subcontractor services  and the availability of subcontractor services 
lionbridge s estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its program managers and other personnel  who review each project monthly to assess the project s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
when adjustments in estimated project costs are determined  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
the agreements entered into in connection with projects are generally terminable by clients upon days prior written notice 
if a client terminates an agreement  it is required to pay lionbridge for time and expenses incurred through the termination date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
lionbridge establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  lionbridge analyzes the collectibility of all accounts 
additionally  lionbridge considers its historical bad debt experience and current economic trends in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts written off in subsequent periods can differ materially from the allowance provided 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
lionbridge assesses the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that lionbridge considers important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when lionbridge determines that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  lionbridge measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill and  as a result  lionbridge ceased amortization of goodwill  therefore  the results of operations for the years ended december  and exclude goodwill amortization expense 
for years prior to january   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is now reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the review is a two step process beginning with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the first step is to review for impairment and the second step is to measure the amount of the impairment  if one is indicated by the first step 
the fair value amounts are determined by discounting future cash flows of the related reporting unit as developed by management 
lionbridge completed goodwill impairment tests as of december  and december  and determined that  as of both dates  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the net assets of each respective reporting unit 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized 
the impairment review is based upon estimated future discounted cash flows 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
lionbridge is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of preparing its consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that lionbridge determines that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense

such acquisitions through december  have resulted in the recognition of approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet

other expense  net primarily reflects the foreign currency transaction gains or losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the countries in which the transactions are recorded 
the company recognized  in other expense in  as compared to million for the corresponding period of the decrease was primarily attributable to the company s ability to implement a number of appropriate financial and operational 
table of contents measures that minimize lionbridge s exposure to currency volatility 
in  other expense  net increased to million from  in the increase was primarily attributable to the impact of an approximate deterioration in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro over the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
the following table shows the provision for benefit from income taxes and the effective income tax rate for the years ended december   and  respectively provision for benefit from income taxes effective income tax rate the provision for benefit from income taxes represents taxes resulting from profits in foreign jurisdictions and certain minimum taxes 
the provision was offset in part by an income tax refund in the us of  as a result of a change in the tax law 
of the provision benefit amounts recorded for and   and  respectively  represents non cash expenses resulting from utilizations of net operating loss carryforwards from business combinations 
the benefit from lionbridge s utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain european countries during these periods was recorded as a reduction of goodwill  rather than a tax benefit  since the deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards had been fully reserved at the time lionbridge acquired the localization businesses of stream international holdings  inc lionbridge recorded no tax benefit for losses generated in other jurisdictions during these periods due to the uncertainty of realizing any future benefit

this variability is due to fluctuations in its clients release cycles  the length of its sales cycle  rapid growth  acquisitions  the emerging nature of the markets in which lionbridge competes  global economic conditions and other factors outside lionbridge s control 
lionbridge believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as a measure of future performance

table of contents lionbridge s working capital increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the million in net proceeds from the company s issuance of  common shares in a follow on public offering  net of the repayment of million of debt and the payment of million for the acquisition of mentorix

this use of cash was reduced in part by million in net adjustments for depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses  including million of accelerated recognition of discount on debt and deferred financing charges on the early repayment of debt 
lionbridge has not experienced any significant trends in accounts receivable and work in process other than changes relative to the increase in revenue  as previously noted 
fluctuations in accounts receivable from period to period relative to changes in revenue are a result of timing of customer invoicing and receipt of payments from customers

table of contents lionbridge s future financing requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including its operating performance and increases in operating expenses associated with growth in its business 
lionbridge anticipates that its present cash position and available financing should provide adequate cash to fund its currently anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months and foreseeable future

table of contents factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
lionbridge s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  without limitation  those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating lionbridge and its business 
lionbridge s revenue and results of operations could be negatively affected by the delay of its clients product releases and production schedules or the loss of a major client 
a significant portion of lionbridge s revenue is linked to the product release cycles and production schedules of its clients  and to certain key clients 
as a result  lionbridge performs varying amounts of work for specific clients from year to year based on their product release cycles and production schedules 
a major client in one year may not have use for a similar level of lionbridge s services in another year 
in addition  lionbridge derives a significant portion of its revenues from large projects and programs for a limited number of clients 
in  lionbridge s largest client accounted for of its revenue and its five largest clients accounted for approximately of its revenue 
as a result  the loss of any major client or a significant reduction in a large project s scope could materially reduce lionbridge s revenue and cash flow  and adversely affect its ability to maintain profitability 
lionbridge s results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
lionbridge conducts a large portion of its business in international markets 
although a majority of lionbridge s contracts with clients are denominated in us dollars  and of its costs and expenses for the quarter ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  of its assets were recorded in foreign currencies as of december  while of its liabilities were recorded in foreign currencies as of december  the principal foreign currencies applicable to our business are the euro and the yen 
as a result  lionbridge is exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
lionbridge has not historically tried to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions  however  it may choose to do so in the future 
recently  the us dollar has been volatile relative to foreign currencies  particularly the euro and the yen 
therefore  lionbridge has experienced exchange rate losses as a result of fluctuations in non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities and changes in revenue and expense mix in various subsidiaries operating in non us dollar denominated functional currencies 
if lionbridge is unsuccessful in reducing foreign currency exchange rate risk  lionbridge may experience additional foreign currency fluctuations which may significantly harm its revenue  cash flow and results of operations  as well as lionbridge s ability to achieve and maintain profitability as it continues to grow its business 
potential fluctuations in lionbridge s quarterly results make financial forecasting difficult and could affect its common stock trading price 
as a result of fluctuations in lionbridge s revenues tied to foreign currency fluctuations  its clients release cycles  the three to nine month length of its typical sales cycle  historical growth  acquisitions  the emerging nature of the markets in which it competes  global economic conditions and other factors outside its control  lionbridge believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of lionbridge s future performance 
lionbridge may not experience revenue increases in future years comparable to the revenue increases in some prior years 
there have been quarters in the past in which lionbridge s results of operations have fallen below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and this may occur in the future 
if in a future quarter lionbridge s results of operations were to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of its common stock would likely decline 

table of contents lionbridge s goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of its assets  any impairment of its goodwill will adversely impact its net income  and lionbridge may never realize the full value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
lionbridge s acquisitions have resulted in the creation of significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets other than goodwill are generally amortized over a three to five year period 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an impairment test  with any excess goodwill carrying value written off in the period of determination 
lionbridge assesses its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
at december   lionbridge had goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization  which represented approximately of its total assets 
lionbridge will continue to incur non cash charges in connection with the amortization of its intangible assets  other than goodwill  over their remaining respective useful lives 
in the future  as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable  lionbridge will evaluate the carrying value of its intangible assets and may take a charge to its earnings 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect lionbridge s ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
lionbridge s business may be harmed by defects or errors in the services it provides to its clients 
many of the services lionbridge provides are critical to its clients businesses 
lionbridge maintains general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions 
defects or errors in the services it provides could result in delayed or lost client revenue  adverse reaction to its clients from their end users and  ultimately  toward lionbridge  claims against lionbridge  negative publicity and additional costs to correct errors or defects 
lionbridge cannot assure you that its general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claims 
if lionbridge fails to attract and retain professional staff  its ability to complete its projects and obtain new projects could suffer 
lionbridge s potential failure to attract and retain qualified employees could impair its ability to complete existing projects and bid for or obtain new projects and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on its business and revenue 
lionbridge s ability to grow and increase its market share largely depends on its ability to hire  train  retain and manage highly skilled employees  including project managers and technical  sales and marketing personnel 
in addition  lionbridge must make sure its employees maintain their technical expertise and business skills 
lionbridge cannot assure you that it will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees or that it will successfully train and manage the employees it hires to allow lionbridge to carry out its operating plan 
lionbridge may be unable to continue to grow at its historical growth rates or to manage its growth effectively 
growth is a key component of increasing the value of lionbridge 
since its inception  lionbridge s business has grown significantly and it anticipates additional future growth 
this growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  lionbridge must continue to evolve its operational systems 
this additional growth may further strain lionbridge s management and operational resources 
lionbridge s growth could also be adversely affected by many other factors  including economic downturns 
as a result of these concerns  lionbridge cannot be sure that it will continue to grow  or  if it does grow  that it will be able to maintain its overall historical growth rate 

table of contents uncertainty in the technology market could affect lionbridge s ability to achieve operating plans 
a substantial portion of lionbridge s revenue is derived from technology companies 
many technology companies have experienced severe slowdowns in their businesses and operations beginning in and continuing during and  and may continue to experience these slowdowns in the future 
a continued slowdown in the technology market may have a negative impact on lionbridge s ability to achieve its operating plans 
difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  health  accounting and business factors could negatively affect lionbridge s business in international markets 
a large component of lionbridge s operations is its ability to conduct business in international markets 
as a result  lionbridge s business is subject to political and economic fluctuations in various countries 
in addition  as lionbridge continues to employ and retain personnel throughout the world and apply varying employment laws  it may face difficulties in integrating such personnel on a cost efficient basis 
to date  lionbridge has been able to successfully staff its international operations  but if lionbridge continues to expand its operations  it may become more difficult to manage its business 
lionbridge conducts business and has operations and clients throughout the world 
lionbridge s and its clients ability to conduct business may also be affected by wars  political unrest  terrorism or the impact of diseases such as sars 
if lionbridge fails to manage these operations successfully  its ability to service its clients and grow its business will be seriously impeded 
lionbridge may have difficulty in identifying and competing for acquisition opportunities 
lionbridge s business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions 
lionbridge currently does not have commitments or agreements with respect to any of these acquisitions 
in executing its acquisition strategy  lionbridge may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
in addition  lionbridge can expect to face competition from other companies for acquisition candidates  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
pursuing and completing potential acquisitions could divert management attention and financial resources and may not produce the desired business results 
as part of its growth strategy  lionbridge intends to continue pursuing and making selected acquisitions of complementary businesses 
lionbridge does not have specific personnel dedicated solely to pursuing and making acquisitions 
as a result  if lionbridge pursues any acquisition  its management  in addition to their operational responsibilities  could spend a significant amount of time and management and financial resources to pursue and integrate the acquired business with its existing business 
to pay for an acquisition  lionbridge might use capital stock  cash or a combination of both 
alternatively  lionbridge may borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if it uses capital stock  lionbridge s stockholders will experience dilution 
if it uses cash or debt financing  lionbridge s financial liquidity may be reduced 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  an acquisition may involve amortization of significant amounts of other intangible assets that could adversely affect lionbridge s ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
despite the investment of these management and financial resources  and completion of due diligence with respect to these efforts  an acquisition may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that lionbridge anticipated  and an acquired service or technology may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  failure of acquired technologies and services to perform as expected  risks of entering markets in which lionbridge has no  or limited  prior experience  
table of contents expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company  the applicability of rules and regulations that might restrict lionbridge s ability to operate  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
if lionbridge fails to keep pace with changing technologies  it may lose clients 
lionbridge s market is characterized by rapidly changing client requirements and evolving technologies and industry standards 
if lionbridge cannot keep pace with these changes  its business could suffer 
the internet s continued growth and strong influence in lionbridge s industry magnifies these characteristics 
to achieve its goals  lionbridge needs to continue to develop strategic business solutions and methodologies that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards  information technology and client preferences or it will not be able to successfully serve its clients 
lionbridge competes in highly competitive markets 
the markets for lionbridge s services are very competitive 
lionbridge cannot assure you that it will compete successfully against these competitors in the future 
some of these companies have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and greater name recognition than lionbridge 
if lionbridge fails to be competitive with these companies in the future  it may lose market share and its revenue could decline 
there are relatively few barriers preventing companies from competing with lionbridge 
although lionbridge owns proprietary technology  lionbridge does not own any patented or other technology that  by itself  precludes or inhibits others from entering its market 
as a result  new market entrants also pose a threat to its business 
in addition to lionbridge s existing competitors  lionbridge may face further competition in the future from companies that do not currently offer globalization or testing services 
lionbridge may also face competition from internal globalization and testing departments of global and large emerging companies 
technology companies  information technology services companies  business process outsourcing companies  web consulting firms  technical support call centers  hosting companies and content management providers may choose to broaden their range of services to include globalization or testing as they expand their operations internationally 
lionbridge cannot assure you that it will be able to compete effectively with potential future competitors 
lionbridge will continue to depend on intellectual property rights to protect its proprietary technologies  although it may not be able to successfully protect these rights 
lionbridge relies on its proprietary technology to enhance some of its service offerings 
lionbridge s policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with its employees  outside consultants and independent contractors 
lionbridge also uses patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law in addition to contractual restrictions to protect its technology 
notwithstanding these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use lionbridge s proprietary technology without authorization 
although lionbridge holds registered or pending united states patents and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology  it cannot be sure of the level of protection that these patents will provide 
lionbridge may have to resort to litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or know how  or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending its proprietary technology is expensive  could cause diversion of lionbridge s resources and may not prove successful 
the laws of other countries may afford lionbridge little or no effective protection of its intellectual property rights 
lionbridge has an accumulated deficit and may not be able to continue to operate profitably 
for the year ended december   lionbridge achieved an operating profit of million 
however  prior to  since inception  lionbridge incurred substantial losses and may incur losses in the future 
lionbridge has an accumulated deficit of million as of december  lionbridge intends to continue to invest in internal expansion  infrastructure  select acquisitions and its sales and marketing efforts 
lionbridge cannot assure you that it will continue to operate profitably in the future 

table of contents the market price of lionbridge common stock may be volatile 
lionbridge s stock price has been extremely volatile  in part due to the historically low trading volume of its stock 
the market price of lionbridge common stock may be affected by many factors  including fluctuations in lionbridge s financial results  actions of lionbridge clients or competitors  future sales of lionbridge common stock by a significant stockholder  changes in market valuations of services companies  lionbridge s announcement of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic alliances  or capital commitments  additions or departures of key clients or officers  futures sales of lionbridge common stock into the public market  and worldwide economic and political conditions 
any adverse impact attributable to any of the foregoing factors may cause the market price of lionbridge common stock to drop significantly 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of lionbridge s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lionbridge is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange fluctuation 
lionbridge does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
lionbridge is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates with respect to its line of credit with a commercial bank 
there were no amounts outstanding as of december  under this facility 
in addition  lionbridge s ability to finance future acquisition through debt transactions may be impacted if it is unable to obtain appropriate debt financing at acceptable rates 
lionbridge is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates through its investing activities 
lionbridge s investment portfolio consists primarily of investments in high grade commercial bank money market accounts 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the carrying value of lionbridge s investments due to their immediate available liquidity or their short maturity 
foreign currency exchange rate losses 
the majority of lionbridge s contracts with clients are denominated in us dollars 
however  and of its costs and expenses in and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies 
twenty eight percent and of its assets were recorded in foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
thirty percent and of its liabilities were recorded in foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
therefore  lionbridge is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
lionbridge has not historically tried to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  it may choose to do so in the future 
there are no assurances that lionbridge may be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  lionbridge may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
