when paid  these amounts will be recorded as additional goodwill 
on march   open text completed an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of eloquent for cash consideration of million  of which million is being held in escrow to secure certain representations  warranties and covenants of eloquent in the acquisition agreement 
the results of operations of eloquent have been consolidated with those of open text beginning march  on february   open text inc oti  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of corechange through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of oti  with and into corechange  with corechange as the surviving corporation

consequently over time  the operational performance of the company s acquired entities on a stand alone basis may not be tracked 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap necessarily requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  the actual results will differ  potentially materially  from those previously estimated 
many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of the company s control 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue the company currently derives all of its revenues from licenses of software products and related services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and to the extent applicable  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company determines that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under a an executed license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and the company  or b a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a license agreement with the company or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
the company does not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
ii delivery has occurred the company s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
the company determines that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at shipment 
iii the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  the company determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 

table of contents iv collectibility is probable and supported the company determines whether collectibility is probable and supported on a case by case basis 
the company may generate a high percentage of its license revenue from its current customer base  for whom there is a history of successful collection 
the company assesses the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if the company is unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon its review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  the company allocates revenue to each element in the arrangement other than licenses based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and post contract customer support pcs components of its license arrangements 
the company sells its consulting services separately  and has established vsoe for these services on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the respective term of the maintenance contract  typically one year 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and pcs 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
the company generally bills consulting services fees on a time and materials basis 
the company s consulting services are not essential to the functionality of its software 
the company s software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and generally do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase consulting services to facilitate the adoption of the company s technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately from professional services 
the company recognizes revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
the company s customers typically purchase pcs annually  and the company prices pcs based on a percentage of the product license fee 
customers purchasing pcs receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customer s financial condition and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would likely be required 
actual collections could differ materially from our estimates 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
see page for management s discussion of the factors necessary for the company to realize its deferred tax assets 
litigation 
the company is a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings 
in these cases  management assesses the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for the company s best estimate of such losses 
to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and result in the company being required to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in 
table of contents the financial statements  the company would be required to record  against earnings  such excess at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain to the company  or a loss less than that provided for  such gain is recognized when received or receivable 
valuation of intangible assets 
the company has a history of acquiring other businesses  and expects that this trend will likely continue in the future 
as part of the completion of any business combination  the company is required to value any intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
this valuation is inherently subjective  and necessarily involves judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows and other operational variables of the entity acquired 
however  there can be no assurance that the judgments and estimates made at the date of acquisition will reflect future performance of the acquired entity 
to assist management with the valuation process  the company has adopted the practice of using independent valuation experts in the valuation process for intangible assets acquired through material acquisitions 
however  if either management or the independent experts make judgments or estimates that differ from actual circumstances  the company may be required to write off certain of its intangible assets 
similarly  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to annually test the value of its goodwill as well as its acquired intangible assets 
this testing requires management to make estimates of the market value of its various operating segments 
changes in estimates could result in different conclusions for the value of goodwill 
the company performs its annual impairment testing on its goodwill at june th each fiscal year  provided that circumstances don t arise during the year that would necessitate an earlier evaluation 
over the past two years  the value of the company s reporting units have exceeded their book value by a substantial margin 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that an impairment of its goodwill will occur in the foreseeable future  although there can be no assurances that at the time a future review is completed  a material impairment charge will not be required and recorded

table of contents the ecm market according to the meta group  the enterprise content management ecm market will reach billion in software and billion in services by  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
they expect that many vendors will adopt the mantle of enterprise content management during the next months  which they have stated has already begun 
over that same period and consistent with experience over the past several years  the company does not expect total information technology spending to increase 
this means that the growth in ecm is coming at the expense of other parts of the it market 
the vast majority of information contained in an organization is unstructured data exactly the type of data that the ecm market is focused on managing 
whereas companies have spent the better part of the last decade focusing on managing the structured data that erp systems center around  their focus has now shifted to the larger opportunity of managing the unstructured data 
over the past year the company has witnessed numerous changes to the social political landscape that have had significant impacts on the ecm market  which the company sees as now being at an inflection point 
events over the past several years such as the september th terrorist attacks  the financial collapse of high profile us corporations such as enron and worldcom  as well as ensuing changes to the regulatory environment such as sarbanes oxley and the patriot act have placed a significant onus on the private and public sectors alike to adopt compliance driven software solutions 
simultaneously  more organizations continue to focus their attention on the preservation of their intellectual property and the knowledge residing throughout their workforces 
with baby boomers retiring  corporations have only recently become sensitive to the fact that a high percentage of the knowledge of their workforces may not be documented or archived in any organized fashion which future employees can retrieve 
the ecm sector has been marked by significant consolidation over the past several years 
sophisticated customers are demanding more robust suites of technology which address all aspects of ecm as compared with past practice of purchasing point solutions from separate vendors to address specific needs 
the largest  most financially stable vendors have taken advantage of their financial position by acquiring many of their smaller competitors in an attempt to round out their product line 
these smaller vendors had found that as the ecm market matured and as ecm technologies became mission critical within organizations  customers became increasingly hesitant to purchase their product if the vendor s financial viability was at all a question 
in many cases  these smaller companies have what is regarded as leading technology  but they lack the financial resources to convince customers that they will remain in business to support and enhance their products for years to come 
within the growing ecm sector  the company has established itself by the end of fiscal as both the largest and fastest growing software vendor in this sector 
the company has seen its competitive landscape evolve over the past year 
given the growth of the ecm market  new vendors continue to try and penetrate the market 
microsoft has recently entered the ecm market with a competitive product which is focused on departmental use rather than enterprise wide deployment as the product does not possess the scalability of livelink 
with the content management offerings coming from the ixos acquisition  the company believes that it has the most comprehensive collaboration and content management software in the industry 
as a result  the company is increasingly competing against more traditional content management vendors such as filenet 
the company feels that one of its key strategic advantages over its competition is the fact that its core technology has been in place for several years 
this has allowed open text to spend the past couple of years focused on designing and delivering solutions to specific market participants 
by contrast  many of the company s competitors are still in the process of acquiring and integrating the requisite technology to provide a complete product offering 
market trends during fiscal  many of the company s customers were dealing with internal mandates to significantly reduce information technology spending 
given these tighter budgets  customers have increasingly focused on 
table of contents purchasing software solutions which help organizations save money 
software that is quickly and easily deployable is currently viewed as being more attractive than software that takes a long time to implement  such as erp systems 
one area within information technology spending which companies are not reducing spending  and in many cases are increasing spending  is compliance focused software 
companies are not able to defer spending to become or remain compliant with the regulatory environments they operate within 
the company is focused on exploiting this opportunity  particularly given the fact that compliance touches all employees in an organization 
as a result  compliance opportunities can evolve into enterprise wide deployments 
during fiscal  the company continued to experience a trend witnessed over the past several years of initial  limited scope deployments quickly evolving into larger deploys 
initial deployments typically last for approximately nine months  subsequent to which the customer will frequently purchase additional licenses for further internal deployment  followed often by an enterprise wide deployment 
this strategy has been a focus of the company s sales efforts since post september th  when it became extremely difficult to close sales opportunities with new customers 
in addition  over the past several years  as many customers imposed rigid spending freezes on purchases of new information technology solutions and initiatives  the company has been able to continue to grow its revenue by further developing relationships and opportunities within its installed base 
historically  the company has been able to generate revenue growth by selling and marketing its products on the proposition that they produced an extremely high return on investment and can actually save companies money 
the fact that the livelink product line is highly configurable without programming means that as soon as it is purchased  an organization can have it deployed almost immediately and can begin saving money 
by contrast  many competitive products and solutions require a significant amount of customized programming and service work adding not only cost but also lead time to the deployment cycle 
both of these factors adversely impact such product s return on investment 
although today the high return on investment of the company s products remains a selling feature  during fiscal the company experienced an increase in customers purchasing products to address key business problems that they cannot delay addressing 
another recent operational trend has been the company s strong focus on vertical markets and designing products to address specific needs of those markets 
the company currently has four vertical sales groups focused on selling solutions to the government  pharmaceutical  financial services  and oil and gas sectors 
the company feels that customized livelink solutions designed specifically for each of these verticals address specific mission critical problems that these industries confront 
pharmaceutical companies  for instance  are focused more than ever on bringing products to market faster and more cost effectively than ever before while remaining fully compliant with food and drug administration regulations 
nearly all regulations require an organization to train and test all employees involved in processes associated with the regulation 
the need for us government agencies to communicate  collaborate  and share knowledge has never been as important as it is today  and the company is increasingly active in this sector 
open text continues to remain focused on selling to its large user installed base as an important source of sales opportunities 
the company has found that customers that initially purchase livelink to address a specific need often expand the deployment of livelink to address multiple other issues within the first year 
the company also feels that the acquisitions it completed over the past several years represent significant cross selling opportunities  and that these cross selling opportunities will represent a further source of future growth 
open text anticipates that it will continue to develop and market ecm related solutions focused on addressing specific problems and specific industries 
open text has not engaged in overly aggressive discounting practices relative to many of its competitors 
over the past several years  the company has maintained an average deal size of between  and  by contrast  ixos content management products had been under significant pricing pressure  driving the average deal size to approximately  over the same period 

table of contents fiscal overview the most significant corporate transaction during fiscal was the acquisition of ixos 
the strength of ixos product line is its strong offering in the area of content management a key aspect of ecm 
traditionally  the strength of open text s product offering has been its collaboration functionality 
taken together  the company believes that the unprecedented one stop shopping combination of collaboration and content functionality achieved through this acquisition provides the company with the most complete ecm suite in the industry 
as of june   the two organizations are now organized as one global organization  and perhaps most importantly  the company s integrated product roadmap is now complete and published 
general availability of the company s first integrated product livelink wcm server occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal with additional integrated products scheduled in the latter half of calendar the majority of the ixos restructuring efforts were completed by june   although some aspects of the company s plans will get executed in early fiscal as a results  the company believes that the synergies between the two companies are only now just starting to be realized  and the company is optimistic that these will continue and broaden into fiscal the company strives to prudently manage expenses 
expense management played a key role in the profitability achieved in fiscal from a products perspective  the continued growth in the company s core livelink business reinforced the fact that the company s value proposition for the ecm market is being well received 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
total revenues included license revenues  customer support revenues  and service revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall increase in revenue was significantly impacted by several acquisitions that the company completed in fiscal during fiscal  the company acquired gauss  domea egovernment  and ixos 
on a combined basis  revenues stemming from these acquisitions accounted for approximately of the revenue growth achieved during fiscal compared to fiscal the remaining million or represents organic revenue growth achieved during fiscal additionally  million was contributed from companies acquired during fiscal which were not included in fiscal results for the entire fiscal year 
the impact that both fiscal and fiscal acquisitions had on the company s revenue growth was reasonably consistent across license  service and support revenues 
as these results indicate  although acquisitions represented the largest component of growth during fiscal  the company s core operations still achieved strong organic growth 
this organic growth reflects the continued demand in the marketplace for the company s software solutions 
the company defines organic growth as being the period to period growth achieved when the impact of the current period s acquisitions are removed 
consequently  organic growth in fiscal represents the fiscal revenue growth compared to fiscal once the impact of ixos  gauss and domea egovernment are removed 
on this basis  the company s organic revenue growth during fiscal was 
an important factor responsible for the increase in license revenues from million to million during fiscal was the impact of the fiscal acquisitions 
these transactions accounted for approximately million of license revenue growth from fiscal or approximately of the year to year growth 
of the remaining growth  million related to a full inclusion of fiscal acquisitions 
the company s organic growth relating to license revenue was during fiscal as compared with fiscal this strong organic growth was driven by the fact that customers who purchase the company s products to address a specific problem in their business very quickly find alternative uses for livelink and within a year often have livelink managing multiple processes 
the organic growth also reflects the fact that the company remains focused on specific industry verticals for its solution offerings 
the company operates sales verticals for the pharmaceutical  financial services  government  and oil and gas industries 
during fiscal  the continued development and strong performance in the company s government vertical had a particularly significant impact on the company s fiscal license revenue growth  although the company s pharmaceutical and financial services verticals also performed well 
additionally  the continued adoption of the company s newly introduced modules 
table of contents was a further contributor to growth 
most of these new products are small components of code licensed as point solutions designed to accelerate deployment by addressing very specific and recurring issues faced by customers 
revenue in this category totaled approximately million during fiscal  and increased to approximately million during fiscal during fiscal  the company did not experience a significant variation from fiscal in the amount of revenue realized from large license transactions 
customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal support revenues stemming from fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately of the revenue growth achieved during fiscal compared to fiscal of the remaining or approximately million of growth achieved during fiscal  million was contributed from companies acquired during fiscal which were not included in fiscal results for the entire fiscal year 
the company s organic growth relating to license revenue was during fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors including the increase in the number of licenses granted in fiscal  as well as strong renewal rates for maintenance contracts for existing customers 
the company continued to experience very strong service contract renewal rates for all of its products  most notably its core livelink products 
over the past year  the company effectively implemented price increases in all regions for its customer support services 
the increases contributed to the revenue growth achieved in fiscal furthermore  growth in support revenue stemming from the company s core livelink products was as compared with fiscal the company believes that this fact demonstrates that the company s customers are very satisfied and dedicated to the company s core product offering 
the company believes that during fiscal the integration of ixos customer support organization will create further operational synergies 
service revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal service revenues stemming from fiscal acquisitions accounted for the entire revenue growth achieved during fiscal compared to fiscal if the impact of the fiscal acquisitions were removed  the company s organic services revenue growth was a decrease of approximately 
this decrease in core service revenues was primarily attributable to the continued challenging market for services engagements globally 
the company is witnessing many of its customers addressing its services needs with in house personnel as opposed to using third parties 
given the difficult service environment  the company is currently focusing on delivering services solutions which have been effective for other customers as opposed to trying to deliver unique consulting solutions to each customer 
in response to this challenging services environment  the company will be taking active steps in fiscal to maximize service revenue opportunities when it will align its services resources by vertical industry 
this mirrors a similar change that the company s sales organization undertook approximately years ago and which has demonstrated considerable success 
the company expects that this will result in the company s sales and services organization working more closely together  with similar areas of expertise  and that these changes will help create more revenue opportunities 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consisted primarily of the costs associated with the royalties payable to third parties whose software is bundled with the company s products  as well as product media  duplication  manuals  packaging expenses  and finder s fees 
cost of license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of license revenues  the cost of license revenues remained consistent at during fiscal the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars is a reflection of the increase in license revenues 
the consistency in the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues is due to the fact that the cost structure has remained unchanged 
in each of fiscal and fiscal  costs related to third party product costs  as well as royalties  represented the vast majority of the cost of license revenue 
also  the companies acquired in fiscal maintained a similar cost structure 
cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and their related costs 
cost of customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal over half of the increase in the cost of customer support revenues is attributable to personnel costs 
the majority of the increase in personnel costs is attributable to personnel costs related to fiscal acquisitions  although the 
table of contents company also experienced an increase in personnel costs for its core operations due to the inclusion of a full year s impact of fiscal acquisition personnel costs 
support personnel increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal whereas historically the company s support personnel has resided predominantly in north america  the company s european based acquisitions have made europe almost as significant as north america with respect to support personnel 
the increased number of personnel in the company s customer support organization drove increases in variable expense categories including communication  travel and office expenses 
occupancy costs increased during fiscal commensurate with the increase in facilities due to fiscal acquisitions 
as a percentage of customer support revenues  customer support costs increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase in percentage terms reflects the fact that the companies acquired during fiscal have higher cost structures compared to the company s core operations and the company has not yet realized full synergies from their integration 
cost of service revenues consisted primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training with respect to the company s various software products 
the most significant component of cost of service revenue is personnel related expenses  while other components include costs associated with travel  occupancy  and third party subcontracting 
cost of service revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal additional costs assumed as a result of the fiscal acquisitions effectively accounted for the entire increase in cost of service revenues  approximately of this increase is the result of the added ixos related expenses  while the balance is largely comprised of other expenses coming from gauss and domea egovernment 
the general mix of expenses associated with the cost of service revenues for the fiscal acquisitions is generally consistent with that of the company s core business  with personnel subcontracting and travel representing approximately three quarters of the entire expense base in this area 
the company experienced higher billing utilization rates during fiscal than it did during fiscal service personnel increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal this increase in headcount driven by the acquisitions occurred primarily in european countries  almost of the service organization personnel were in europe at the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately from the end of fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of engineering personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facilities and equipment costs 
to date the company has expensed all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in research and developments expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from approximately million of additional expenses added as part of the integration of the development organizations of the fiscal acquisitions  primarily attributable to ixos 
the balance of the increase is attributable to increased spending within the company s core development organization  which recorded an additional million in operating expenses during fiscal and was offset by increased tax credits associated with qualifying research and development activities of million 
development personnel increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the vast majority of growth in the company s development organization was centered in europe 
whereas the company had effectively no european development presence at the end of fiscal  at the end of fiscal over of the company s development headcount was in europe 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of compensation of sales and marketing personnel  as well as expenses associated with advertising  trade shows  facilities and other expenses related to the sales and marketing of the company s products and services 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the vast majority of the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars was the result of costs added because of the fiscal acquisitions  as only approximately of the increase in sales and marketing expenses relates to the company s core operations 
furthermore  the increased spending within the company s 
table of contents core operations was almost exclusively focused on marketing as the company s core spending on sales was consistent with the prior year 
with ecm becoming a viable  growing segment of the software market  the company is placing additional emphasis on marketing initiatives in an effort to be globally regarded as the ecm market leader 
sales and marketing personnel increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal similar to the other functional groups  this increase in headcount was focused in europe due to the fiscal acquisitions 
as of june   approximately of the company s sales and marketing personnel were located in europe as compared to in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the salaries of administrative personnel  related overhead  facilities expenses and corporate public company costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal but remained consistent as a percentage of total revenues at in both fiscal and over half of the increase in general and administrative expenses relate to expenses added as part of the acquisitions 
approximately of the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses relates to increased personnel the company added throughout fiscal as the size and scope of the company s business continues to grow  open text requires a more sophisticated infrastructure to support the changing needs of the business 
all areas within general and administrative expenses  including finance  information technology  and human resources  added headcount during the year 
total general and administrative personnel increased from as of june  to as of june  whereas approximately of the company s general and administrative personnel were located in north america as of june   this percentage has been reduced to a little over as of june  as a result of the fiscal acquisitions 
the remainder of the increase in general and administrative expenses is comprised of higher spending in a number of non personnel areas  including compliance with new legislation including the sarbanes oxley act  as well as increased spending with respect to consulting and travel resulting from significant acquisition integration activities 
depreciation expenses 
depreciation expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal almost all of the increase in depreciation expense is a result of increased depreciation expenses recorded during the year relating to capital assets acquired as part of the fiscal acquisitions 
before the impact of the fiscal acquisition depreciation is considered  the company s depreciation expense remained consistent with the depreciation expense the company recorded during fiscal during the year  the impact of the full depreciation of older assets was not offset by depreciation on newer capital assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets includes the amortization of both acquired technology and customer assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was principally the result of acquisitions during fiscal  which accounted for of the increase as the size of acquisitions completed during fiscal was far greater than those completed in any previous fiscal year 
as a result  the amount allocated as part of the various purchase price allocations  to intangible assets  was also greater than in any previous fiscal year 
because the amortization of acquired intangible assets has only been included from the date of acquisition  this expense will continue to increase substantially in fiscal when a full year amortization is recorded for the fiscal acquisitions 
the remaining increase was due to amortization of acquired intangibles from acquisitions in fiscal being included for a full fiscal year as compared to the months of amortization expense recorded on the acquisitions during fiscal other income 
other income decreased from million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal other income consists primarily of foreign exchange gains or losses  which reflect relative movements in the various foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
interest 
interest income  net remained unchanged at million in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents income taxes 
during fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of million compared to million during fiscal the increase in the company s tax provision is due to the fact that during fiscal  the company became taxable or began using acquired losses in certain taxing jurisdictions where it was previously able to use internally generated tax loss carry forwards 
when the company uses losses acquired in business combinations  the benefit of those losses impacts the purchase equation and not the income statement as occurs with internally generated loss carryforwards 
the company s deferred tax asset of million arises from available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
the company s ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon the operations of the company in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the deferred tax liability arises from the amortization of timing differences relating to acquired intangible assets  non capital losses acquired at a discount in asset acquisitions  and future income inclusions 
management records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  management has determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of its deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  this increase is primarily attributable to valuation allowances against acquired loss carryforwards in the year 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  the company will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on the company s current projection of taxable income for the periods in the jurisdictions in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of the recognized deferred income tax assets at june  during fiscal  the company recorded deferred tax assets of million and deferred tax liabilities of million in connection with its acquisition of ixos 
deferred tax assets associated with the acquisition of gauss were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
total revenues included license revenues  customer support revenues  and service revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues from license increased from million in fiscal to million fiscal the increase in license revenues was a result of several factors  including the company s focus on certain industry verticals for its solution offerings 
in particular  the emergence of strong performance in the pharmaceutical  government  and financial services sectors contributed to the company s fiscal license revenue growth 
also contributing to license revenue growth were the acquisitions completed during fiscal specifically  approximately million of license revenue was recorded during the fiscal year relating to the fiscal acquisitions 
additionally  the introduction of new modules designed to accelerate deployment and address very specific issues faced by customers further contributed to the company s growth in license revenues 
revenue of these products totaled approximately million during fiscal during fiscal  the company also saw the continued return of large license transactions  a trend that began during the fourth quarter of fiscal customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors including the increase in the number of licenses granted in fiscal  as well as strong renewal rates for maintenance contracts for existing customers 
during fiscal  the company effectively implemented price increases in all regions for its customer support services and those increases contributed to the revenue growth achieved in fiscal additionally  in fiscal the company s customer support organization began to offer to customers a number of value added support programs 
the acquisitions in fiscal also contributed to the growth in customer support revenues 
approximately of the growth in customer support revenues relates to the fiscal acquisitions  while the remaining growth relates to the company s organic business 
the company s renewal rate of maintenance contracts for the company s products was in excess of 

table of contents service revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in service revenues was primarily attributable to the continued challenging market for services engagements globally 
although in aggregate the company s service revenue decreased slightly from fiscal to fiscal  the company experienced an increase in livelink related service engagements 
the company also generated consulting and integration revenues relating to customers of companies acquired during fiscal totaling approximately  during fiscal these increases were more than offset by a decrease in services revenue relating to certain of the company s older products 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consisted primarily of the costs associated with the royalties payable to third parties whose software is bundled with the company s products  as well as product media  duplication  manuals  packaging expenses  and finder s fees 
cost of license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of license revenues  the cost of license revenues increased slightly from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars was a reflection of the increase in license revenues 
the increase in cost of license as a percentage of license revenues was due to higher third party product costs included in licenses granted during fiscal associated largely with acquired companies products 
cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and their related costs 
cost of customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased personnel costs relating to the company s core operations increased approximately million  while the impact of the company s fiscal acquisitions totaled approximately  the most significant component of which were personnel costs 
as a percentage of customer support revenues  customer support costs decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal  reflective of the fact that the company effectively restructured the acquired companies cost structures and that the company realized some economies of scale as its support organization continued to grow 
cost of service revenues consisted primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training 
cost of service revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  additional costs assumed as a result of the fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately  of the increase in absolute dollars in costs of service revenues compared with fiscal also impacting costs of service revenues is the fact that in fiscal the company recorded approximately  less of investment tax credits through its services organization  due to the fact that the amount of investment tax credits recorded during fiscal was atypically high 
investment tax credits are recorded as a credit to cost of service revenues 
consequently  once the impact of the acquisitions and investment tax credits are removed  the company s core services organization actually realized a decrease in costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal this decrease in core cost of services was a result of both a slight decrease in personnel costs related to lower personnel in the company s services organization during fiscal  as well as lower expenses incurred with respect to the company s user s conferences as compared with fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of engineering personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facilities and equipment costs 
the company expensed all research and development costs as incurred during the year 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and  as a percentage of total revenues  remained relatively consistent at in both fiscal and the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from approximately million of additional expenses added as part of the integration of the development organizations of the companies acquired in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal also resulted from the fact that in fiscal the company recorded approximately  less in investment tax credits  which were recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses 
the investment tax credits recorded during fiscal were atypically high  and were not considered to be indicative of claims expected to be made in subsequent years 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of compensation of sales and marketing personnel  as well as expenses associated with advertising  trade shows  facilities and other expenses related to the sales and marketing of the company s products and services 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million fiscal to million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal of the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars  million related to additional marketing initiatives  approximately half of which related to the companies acquired in fiscal additionally  sales costs assumed as part of the company s acquisitions accounted for an additional million of sales and marketing expenses during fiscal consequently  sales expenses decreased by approximately million within the company s core business operations during fiscal  the majority of which relates to approximately  less of severance costs during fiscal compared to fiscal  when the company underwent an internal resizing program aimed at reducing costs throughout the organization 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the salaries of administrative personnel and related overhead and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal but remained consistent as a percentage of total revenues at in both fiscal and of the million increase in general and administrative expenses  approximately half related to the acquisitions  most notably centrinity 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses related to increases in a number of administrative areas  the majority of which were driven by a higher volume of business activity in fiscal as compared with fiscal depreciation expenses 
depreciation expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in depreciation expense was a result of the fact the company did not make significant capital expenditures in fiscal depreciation relating to the capital assets added as part of the fiscal acquisitions was only recorded for a partial year  and as a result this additional depreciation did not offset the reduction realized from the company s core base of capital assets during the year 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets includes amortization of both acquired technology and customer assets 
additionally  during fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets included amortization of goodwill on acquisitions 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company discontinued its amortization of goodwill consistent with new accounting pronouncements 
as a result  amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was principally the result of the discontinued amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by additional amortization on the intangible assets recorded as part of the fiscal acquisitions 
other income loss 
other income increased from million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the gain of million related primarily to the company s attempted acquisition of accelio corporation  a software company located in ottawa  ontario 
the gain that the company realized on this attempted acquisition arose from the sale of shares of accelio common stock owned by the company and in connection with certain lock up agreements in connection with the attempted acquisition  partially offset by the costs incurred 
the million gain in fiscal was primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains realized during the year  the most significant cause of which was the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
interest 
interest income decreased from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower interest rates realized during fiscal as compared with fiscal 
table of contents income taxes 
during fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of million compared to  during fiscal the increase in the company s tax provision was due to the fact that during fiscal  the company became taxable in certain taxing jurisdictions where it was previously able to use loss carryforwards 
quarterly results the following table summarizes selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the past eight quarters fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands  except per share data total revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic diluted fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands  except per share data total revenues gross profit net income net income per share basic diluted the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including changes in demand for the company s products  the introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors or delays thereof  market acceptance of products or enhancements  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  changes in the company s pricing policies or those of its competitors  delays involved in installing products with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed or sold  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
in addition  like many other software companies  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last weeks of each quarter 
the company s revenues for the quarter ended september of each fiscal year generally have been lower than revenues for other quarters 
the acquisition of ixos  which generates a very high proportion of its revenues in europe  will make this trend more pronounced going forward 
however  it is uncertain whether this trend will continue in current or future periods 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results in a particular quarter may fail to meet market expectations  which could result in a decrease in the price of common shares and a loss to shareholders

these purchase warrants expire in february assuming of the outstanding warrants are exercised prior to expiration  the company can expect to receive further cash proceeds of approximately million 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the fact that the company undertook a restructuring during its third quarter of fiscal and million was paid out relating to this undertaking by june  net cash used in investment activities during fiscal was million of which million relates to the acquisition of gauss  million relates to the acquisition of domea egovernment  and cash provided through the acquisition of ixos of million

the following factors  as well as all of the other information set forth herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating open text and its business 
if any of the following risks were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of the company s common shares would likely decline 
if the company does not continue to develop new technologically advanced products  future revenues will be negatively affected open text s success will depend on its ability to design  develop  test  market  license and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to both competitive products and evolving demands of the marketplace 
in addition  new software products and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats 
presently  open text is continuing to enhance the capability of its livelink software to enable users to form workgroups and collaborate on intranets and the internet 
the company increasingly must integrate software licensed from third parties with its own software to create or improve intranet and internet products 
these products are key to the success of the company s strategy  and the company may not be successful in developing and marketing these and other new software products and enhancements 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate the technologies licensed from third parties  to develop new software products and enhancements to existing products  or to complete products currently under development  or if such integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the company s operating results will materially suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that the company does not anticipate or adapt to  the company s software products could be rendered obsolete and its business would be materially harmed 
if the company s products and services do not gain market acceptance  the company may not be able to increase its revenues open text intends to pursue its strategy of growing the capabilities of its ecm software offerings through the in house research and development of new product offerings 
during fiscal  the company enhanced livelink and several of its optional components to continue to set the standard for enterprise content management capabilities and in response to customer requests 
examples include the addition of secure instant messaging capability and the ability to distribute rich media presentations including video  voice and text 
table of contents components to a wide audience over the web 
the primary market for open text s software and services is rapidly evolving 
as is typical in the case of a rapidly evolving industry  demand for and market acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the markets for the company s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  the company s business will suffer 
the company may be unable to successfully market its current products and services  develop new software products  services and enhancements to current products and services  complete customer installations on a timely basis  or complete products and services currently under development 
if the company s products and services or enhancements do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  the company s business and operating results will be materially harmed 
current and future competitors could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits the markets for the company s products are new  intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and are evolving rapidly 
the company expects competition to increase and intensify in the future as the markets for the company s products continue to develop and as additional companies enter each of its markets 
numerous releases of products that compete with those of the company can be expected in the near future 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
if competitors were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or significant price competition were to otherwise develop  the company would likely be forced to lower its prices 
this could result in lower revenues  reduced margins  loss of customers  or loss of market share for the company 
acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect the company s operating results open text acquired a number of companies in each of fiscal and and continues to seek out opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that expand  complement or are otherwise related to the company s current business or products 
the company also considers from time to time  opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments 
these activities and acquisitions create risks including the need to integrate and manage the businesses acquired with the business of the company  additional demands on the company s management  resources  systems  procedures and controls  disruption of the company s ongoing business and diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
moreover  these transactions could involve substantial investment of funds and or technology transfers and the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses 
also  such activities could result in one time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute existing shareholders or result in the assumption of debt 
such acquisitions  investments  joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of the company 
any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue  income or other returns to the company  and the financial or other resources committed to such activities will not be available to the company for other purposes 
in addition  if open text acquires companies with weak internal controls  it will take time to get the acquired company up to the same level of operating effectiveness as open text 
the company s inability to address these risks could negatively affect the company s operating results 
the tender offer for all shares of ixos by open text began on december  on february   open text corporation closed the tender offer  pursuant to which  ontario  a wholly owned subsidiary of open text corporation  acquired a total of  ixos shares or approximately of the ordinary share capital and voting rights of ixos  including shares acquired in the open market 
between the closing date of the tender offer and june   open text acquired an additional  common shares of ixos 
as a result of the additional purchase  ontario obtained a total of  ixos shares or approximately ownership in ixos 
the issuance of common shares and common share purchase warrants by open text under the offer and the subsequent resale of these securities may result in a material adverse affect on the market value of our common shares 
after completion of the offer  open text must successfully integrate  among other 
table of contents things  certain product offerings  product development  sales and marketing  administrative and customer service functions  and management information systems of the company and ixos 
this integration may cause disruptions  including potential loss of customers  suppliers  and other business partners  in the business of open text or that of ixos  which could have material adverse effects on each company s or the combined companys business and operations 
in addition  open text may not be able to retain the management and key employees of ixos 
it is possible that these integration efforts will not be completed as efficiently as planned or will distract management from the operations of the combined company 
expected cost savings from the business combination may not be fully realized or realized within the company s expected time frames 
businesses acquired by the company may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with those of the company the company has a history of acquiring complementary businesses with varying levels of organizational size and complexity 
upon consummating an acquisition  the company seeks to implement its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls at the acquired company as promptly as possible 
depending upon the size and complexity of the business acquired  the implementation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls at an acquired company may be a lengthy process 
typically the company conducts due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition  however  the company s integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls of an acquired company 
the company believes that the process involved in completing the integration of the company s own disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls at an acquired business will sufficiently correct any identified deficiencies 
a reduction in the number or sales efforts by distributors could materially impact the company s revenues a material portion of the company s revenue is derived from the license of its products through third parties 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop 
the company may not be able to retain a sufficient number of its existing or future distributors 
distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of other products which could include products of competitors or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing the company s products 
the performance of third party distributors is largely outside the control of the company and the company is unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing the company s products 
a reduction in sales efforts  a decline in the number of distributors  or the discontinuance of sales of the company s products by its distributors could lead to reduced revenue 
the company s international operations expose the company to business risks that could cause the company s operating results to suffer open text intends to continue to make efforts to increase its international operations and anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
the company is increasing its presence in the european market  especially since its acquisition of ixos 
revenues derived outside of north america represented   and of total revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
these international operations are subject to certain risks and costs  including the difficulty and expense of administering business abroad  compliance with foreign laws  compliance with domestic and international import and export laws and regulations  costs related to localizing products for foreign markets  and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner 
international operations also tend to expose the company to a longer sales and collection cycle  as well as potential losses arising from currency fluctuations  and limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings 
significant international sales may also expose the company to greater risk from political and economic instability  unexpected changes in canadian  us or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology  other regulatory requirements and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which could also materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
moreover  international 
table of contents expansion may be more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
as a result  if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  the company s operating results will suffer 
the company s products may contain defects that could harm the company s reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose the company to litigation the company s products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of commercial shipments  or  if discovered  the company may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  despite tests carried out by the company on all its products  the company may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which its products will operate and  as a result  the company may be unable to adequately detect design defects or software errors inherent in its products and which only become apparent when the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in the company s products could result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of the company s products  and alleviating such errors and failures in the company s products could require significant expenditure of capital and other resources by the company 
the harm to the company s reputation resulting from product errors and failures would be damaging to the company 
the company regularly provides a warranty with its products and the financial impact of these warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
the company s agreements with its strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to claims  such as exclusions of all implied warranties and limitations on the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect the company against claims and related liabilities and costs 
although the company maintains errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate and all claims may not be covered 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect the company s financial condition 
other companies may claim that the company infringes their intellectual property  which could result in significant costs to defend and if the company is not successful could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits although the company does not believe that its products infringe on the rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future  and any such assertions may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties  such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
in particular  as software patents become more prevalent  it is possible that certain parties will claim that the company s products violate their patents 
such claims could be disruptive to the company s ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as the company attempts to license the patents or rework its products to ensure that they are not in violation of the claimant s patents or dispute the claims 
any of the foregoing could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits 
the loss of licenses to use third party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect the company s business the company currently depends on certain third party software  the loss of which could result in increased costs of  or delays in  licenses of the company s products 
for a limited number of product modules  the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in its products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported  maintained  or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of license to use  or the inability of licensors to support  maintain  and enhance any of such software  could result in increased costs  delays  or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed  if at all  and integrated  and could adversely affect the company s business 

table of contents the company s success depends and will depend on our relationships with strategic partners the company relies on close cooperation with leading partners for product development  optimization  and sales 
if any of our partners should decide for any reason to terminate or scale back their cooperative efforts with the company  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the length of the company s sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter because the decision by a customer to purchase the company s products often involves relatively large scale implementation across the customer s network or networks  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization in order to implement the company s software  the company s sales cycle tends to take considerable time to complete 
particularly in the current economic environment of reduced information technology spending  it can take several months  or even quarters  for sales opportunities to translate into revenue 
if installation of the company s products in one or more customers takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which revenue from these licenses could be recognized would be delayed 
such delays could cause the company s revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period 
our expenses may not match anticipated revenues we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company must continue to manage its growth or its operating results could be adversely affected over the past several years  open text has experienced growth in revenues  operating expenses  and product distribution channels 
in addition  open text s markets have continued to evolve at a rapid pace 
the total number of employees of the company has grown to approximately as of june  the company believes that continued growth in the breadth of its product lines and services and in the number of personnel will be required in order to establish and maintain the company s competitive position 
moreover  the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and continues to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of its business 
open text s growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on its administrative and operational resources and increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s administrative infrastructure  systems  procedures and controls may not adequately support the company s operations and the company s management may not be able to achieve the rapid  effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully penetrate the markets for the company s products and services and to successfully integrate any business acquisitions in the future 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s operating results will likely suffer 
the company s products rely on the stability of various infrastructure software that  if not stable  could negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s products  resulting in harm to the reputation and business of the company developments of internet and intranet applications by open text depends on the stability  functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet  such as that of sun  hp  oracle  microsoft 
table of contents and others 
if weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist  the company may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses 
if the company is unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that the company s products do not meet customer needs or expectations  the company s business and reputation may be significantly harmed 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could materially impact the price of the company s common shares the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results caused by many factors  including changes in the demand for the company s products  the introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of enhancements or products  delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  changes in the company s pricing policies or those of its competitors  delays involved in installing products with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of restructuring charges taken in connection with acquisitions completed by the company  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
like many other software companies  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last weeks of each quarter 
accordingly  the cancellation or deferrals of even a small number of licenses or delays in installations of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in any particular quarter 
because of the impact of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of the company s business and the markets it serves  the company cannot predict whether seasonal patterns experienced in the past will continue 
for these reasons  no one should rely on period to period comparisons of the company s financial results to forecast future performance 
it is likely that the company s quarterly revenue and operating results will vary significantly in the future and if a shortfall in revenue occurs or if operating costs increase significantly  the market price of our common shares could materially decline 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively the company is highly dependent on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights may not be successful 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain its proprietary rights 
the company  subject to those patents and patents pending as discussed on page  has not sought patent protection for its products 
while us and canadian copyright laws  international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of canada or the united states 
software piracy has been  and can be expected to be  a persistent problem for the software industry 
enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may be difficult  particularly in some nations outside of the united states and canada in which the company seeks to market its products 
despite the precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties  including competitors  to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
if the company is not able to attract and retain top employees  the company s ability to compete may be harmed the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm the company s business 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the company s success is also highly dependent on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  
table of contents retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  including recently hired officers and other employees 
specifically  the recruitment of top research developers  along with experienced salespeople  remains critical to the company s success 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the volatility of the company s stock price could lead to losses by shareholders the market price of the common shares has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies or have resulted from the failure of the operating results of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter 
broad market fluctuations or any failure of the company s operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of the common shares  resulting in losses to shareholders 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
due to the volatility of our stock price  the company could be the target of securities litigation in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes and non income taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
new accounting pronouncements may require us to change the way in which we account for our operational or business activities the financial accounting standards board and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts are constantly discussing proposals designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses 
the effect of the pronouncements of fasb and other bodies may have the effect of requiring us to account for revenues and or expenses in a different manner than at present 
in particular  if the fasb or any other standard setting or regulatory body requires us to expense the fair value of stock options  we would likely report increased expenses in our income statement and a reduction of our net income and earnings per share 
the impact of applying a fair value method of accounting for stock options is disclosed in the note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to its investment portfolio  since the company had no borrowings outstanding under its line of credit at june  the company primarily
