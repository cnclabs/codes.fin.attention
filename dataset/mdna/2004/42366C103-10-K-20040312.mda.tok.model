item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is related to our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto beginning on f of this form k 
statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before part i above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting clinical testing 
we have established a strong foundation of laboratory and pre clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acid to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and the development of the therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic disease 
our strategy is to obtain the required regulatory approval which will allow the progressive introduction of ampligen r our proprietary drug for treating myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic syndrome me cfs  hiv  hepatitis c hcv and hepatitis b hbv in the us  canada  europe and japan 
in february   we completed the double blind segment of the amp phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in treating me cfs 
the remaining patients are enrolled in the open label portion of the trial and should complete this segment by june  with the conclusion of the double blind segment we can finalize data collection and start date analysis in anticipation of preparing the nda for submission to the fda 
ampligen r is also in phase iib clinical trials in the us for the treatment of newly emerged multi drug resistant hiv  and for the induction of cell mediated immunity in hiv patients that are under control using potentially toxic drug cocktail 
our proprietary drug technology utilizes specifically configured ribonucleic acid rna and is protected by more than patents worldwide as well as over additional patent applications pending to provide further proprietary protection in various international markets 
certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r alone and certain patent apply to the use of ampligen r in combination with certain other drugs 
some composition of matter patents pertain to other new medication  which have a similar mechanism of action 
in march   we acquired from isi  all of isi s raw materials  work in progress and finished product of alferon n injection r  together with a limited license for the production  manufacture  use  marketing and sale of the product 
alferon n injection r 
interferon alfa n human derived 
is a natural alpha interferon that has been approved by the us food and drug administration fda for commercial sale for the treatment of certain types of genital warts 
we intend to market this product in the united state through sales facilitated via third party marketing agreements 
additionally  we intend to implement studies  beyond those conducted by isi  for testing the potential treatment of hiv  hepatitis c and other indications  including multiple sclerosis 
we were incorporated in maryland in under the name hem research  inc  and originally served as a supplier of research support products 
our business was redirected in the early s to the development of nucleic acid pharmaceutical technology and the commercialization of rna drugs 
we were reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to hem pharmaceutical corp 
in and to hemispherx biopharma  inc  in june we have three domestic subsidiaries biopro corp  bioaegean corp  and core biotech corp  all of which are incorporated in delaware 
our foreign subsidiaries include hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa established in belgium in and hemispherx biopharma europe sa incorporated in luxembourg in result of operations years ended december  vs 
during the year ended december   we acquired certain assets and patent rights to alferon n injection r  privately placed the march  the july  and october  convertible debentures with an aggregate maturity value of  gross proceeds of  continued our efforts to develop ampligen r for the treatment of patients afflicted with me cfs and hiv  activated the isi new brunswick production facility to process doses of alferon n and produced some  doses of alferon n for sale in net loss our net loss was approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of  in per share loss in was cents versus a per share loss of in this year to year increase in losses of  is primarily due to non cash financing costs of  relating to our march  july  and october convertible debentures 
these non cash charges account for of our net losses for the year ended december  in addition  our losses during this period include  in operating expenses relating to our new alferon division 
solely for comparison purposes  excluding our losses for these two factors  our losses were  in compared to  in or a reduction totaling  this was primarily due to a decrease in research and development direct costs of  in due to reduced costs associated with the development of ampligen r to treat me cfs patients 
during  our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial was in full force and effect therefore increasing our manufacturing and clinical support expenses during that period see research and development costs below 
this was offset by the recovery of certain legal expenses in of approximately  related to the asensio lawsuit and trial from our insurance carrier 
this recovery produced a one time reduction in g a expenses for see general and administrative expenses below 
revenues our revenues were  in compared to revenues of  in our revenues included a licensing fee payment of approximately  which was not repeated in revenues from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe were  in versus  in these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
in addition  since the march   acquisition of inventory from isi  revenues from sales of alferon n totaled  sales of alferon n are anticipated to increase as we are producing more product and our marketing sales programs are underway 
revenues from the cost recovery treatment programs in were  or higher than revenues 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to our efforts to complete the amp me cfs phase iii trials and the focus of our clinical resources on the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the clinical data collected in the us amp phase iii me cfs trial 
in  we received a licensing fee of  euros  from laboratorios del dr 
esteve sa esteve pursuant to a sales and distribution agreement in which esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen r in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs in turn we provided to esteve technical scientific and commercial information 
the agreement terms require no additional performance by us 
since acquiring the right to manufacture and market alferon n in march  we have focused on converting the work in progress inventory into finished goods 
this work in progress inventory included three production lots totaling the equivalent of approximately  vials doses at various stages of the manufacturing process 
in august  we released the first lot of product to abbott laboratories for bottling and realized some  vials of alferon n 
preliminary work has started on completing the second lot of approximately  vials 
our production and quality control personnel in the new brunswick facility are involved in the extensive process of manufacturing and validation required by the fda 
plans are underway for completing the third lot of some  vials now in very early stages of production 
our marketing and sales plan for alferon n consists of engaging sales force contract organizations and supplementing their sales efforts with marketing support 
this marketing support would consist of building awareness of alferon n with physicians as a successful and effective treatment of refractory on recurring external genital warts in patients of age or older and to assist primary prescribers in expanding their practice 
on august   we entered into a sales and marketing agreement with engitech  llc 
to distribute alferon n on a nationwide basis 
the agreement stipulated that engitech will deploy a sales force of sales representatives within one year in the us domestic market and further expand the sales team up to sales representative in the second year and after that as many as it takes to continually drive market share 
engitech  inc is to develop and implement marketing plans including extensive scientific and educational programs for use in marketing alferon n 
production costs production costs were  for the year ended december  these costs reflect approximately  for the cost of sales of alferon n injection r during the period of april  through december  in addition  we recorded  of production costs at the new brunswick facility 
we ramped up the facility in april and started production on three lots of alferon n injection r work in process inventory of which one lot was completed and is ready to be sold 
research and development costs our overall research and development direct costs in were  compared to research and development direct costs in of  these costs primarily reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases and cancers 
at this time  this effort consists of on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
our research and development direct costs are  lower in due to reduced costs associated with the development of ampligen r to treat me cfs patients 
during  our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial was in full force and effect  therefore  increasing our manufacturing and clinical support expenses during that period 
our strategy is to develop our lead compound  the experimental immunotherapeutic ampligen r  to treat chronic diseases for which there is currently no adequate treatment available 
we seek the required regulatory approval  which will allow the commercial introduction of ampligen for me cfs and hiv aids in the us  canada  europe and japan 
we recently completed the double blind segment of our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in the treatment of me cfs 
ampligen is also currently in two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv to overcome multi drug resistance  virus mutation and toxicity associated with current haart therapies 
one study  the amp  is a salvage therapy  conducted in the us and evaluating the potential synergistic efficacy of ampligen in multi drug resistant hiv patients for immune enhancement 
the second study  the amp  is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of ampligen under strategic treatment intervention and is also conducted in the us the amp study is presently on hold as we devote our efforts on the amp study 
amp over patients have participated in our me cfs phase iii clinical trial 
approximately patients are in the open label phase of the clinical process 
we have completed the randomized placebo controlled phase of this study and expect to complete data collection and start the data analysis process with the expectation of filing an nda new drug application with the fda by the end of as with any experimental drug being tested for use in treating human diseases  the fda must approve the testing and clinical protocols employed and must render their decision based on the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested 
historically this is a long and costly process 
our me cfs amp clinical study is a phase iii study  which based on favorable results  will serve as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
the fda review process could take months and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  required more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
amp and amp we are currently focused on recruiting additional clinical investigators and hiv patients to participate in the amp hiv clinical trial 
our efforts to do this have been somewhat hampered in late as most of our clinical resources have been directed to completing the amp me cfs clinical trial 
now that the amp patients have completed the randomized segment of the clinical trial  we expect to devote more resources toward the amp hiv clinical trial 
our amp hiv clinical trial has been put on hold at this time 
in july  dr 
blick  a principal investigator in our hiv studies  presented updated results on our amp hiv study at the nd ias conference on hiv pathogenesis and treatment in paris france 
in this study using strategic treatment interruption sti  patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen r is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
ampligen r is an experimental immunotherapeutic designed to display both antiviral an immune enhancing characteristics 
prolonged use of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has been associated with long term  potentially fatal  toxicities 
the clinical study amp is designed to address these issues by evaluating the administration of our lead experimental agent  ampligen r  a double stranded rna drug acting potentially both as an immunomodulator and antiviral 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen r therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen r  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen r therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
as more patients are enrolled  the related clinical costs will continue to increase with some offset to our overall expenses due to the diminishing cost of the me cfs clinical trial 
it is difficult to estimate the duration or projected costs of these two clinical trials due to the many variables involved  ie patient drop out rate  recruitment of clinical investigators  etc 
the length of the study and costs related to our clinical trials cannot be determined at this time as such will be materially influenced by a the number of clinical investigators needed to recruit and treat the required number of patients  b the rate of accrual of patients and c the retention of patients in the studies and their adherence to the study protocol requirements 
under optimal conditions  the cost of completing the studies could be approximately to million 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  as there is competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment may compete for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a were  during the year ended december   which includes  of expenses relating to our new alferon division and  for a non cash stock compensation charge 
excluding the alferon expenses  our g a costs were  compared to  of expenses in this increase of  is primarily due to the recovery of certain legal expenses in of approximately  related to the asensio lawsuit and trial from our insurance carrier 
this recovery produced a one time reduction in g a expenses for also  we recorded non cash stock compensation expenses of  in as compared to  in equity loss unconsolidated affiliates in the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of  to operations with respect to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
 of these charges were related to our investment in red these charges were the result of our determination that red s business and financial position had deteriorated to the point that our investment had been permanently impaired 
we also recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix biomedical 
this impairment reduced our carrying value in this investment to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on its then proposed investment offering 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated affiliate 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
other income expense interest and other income totaled  in compared to  recorded in lower cash available for investment basically accounted for the difference as interest rates remained relatively low in all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and financing costs were  in non cash financing costs consist of  for the amortization of debenture closing costs   for the amortization of original issue discounts and  for the amortization of costs associated with beneficial conversion features of the debentures and the fair value of the warrants relating to the january  july and october convertible debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
years ended december  vs 
net loss our net loss was approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of  in per share loss in was versus a per share loss of in this year to year decrease in losses of  was primarily due to higher revenues and lower costs in revenues were up  in and total expenses were down by  offset by a write down in the carrying value of our investments in the amount of  for a net cost decrease of  revenues our revenues came from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe 
these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
revenues from cost recovery treatment programs totaled some  in in  these revenues were  or higher than revenues 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to the focus of our clinical resources on conducting and completing the amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial as well as the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the data collected in the us phase iii me cfs trial 
we received a licensing fee of  euros some  from esteve pursuant to a sales and distribution agreement in which esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen r in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs in turn we provided to esteve technical scientific and commercial information 
the agreement terms require no additional performance by us 
our total revenues  including this licensing fee  in was  compared to revenues of  in research and development costs our strategy is to develop our lead compound  the experimental immunotherapeutic ampligen r  to treat chronic diseases for which there is currently no adequate treatment available 
we seek the required regulatory approval  which will allow the commercial introduction of ampligen for me cfs and hiv aids in the us  canada  europe and japan 
at december   ampligen was being tested in a phase iii clinical trial  in the us  for use in treatment of me cfs  the so called amp study 
it also was in two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv to overcome multi drug resistance  virus mutation and toxicity associated with current haart therapies 
one study  the amp  is a salvage therapy  conducted in the us and evaluating the potential synergistic efficacy of ampligen in multi drug resistant hiv patients for immune enhancement 
the second study  the amp  is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of ampligen under strategic treatment intervention and is also conducted in the us amp as of december   the amp clinical trial was fully enrolled with more than the targeted patients in order to potentially compensate for drop outs 
the last patients completed the randomized segment of this clinical trial in february  the next stage of the program is final data collection  quality assurance of the data to insure its accuracy and analysis of the data according to regulatory guidelines to facilitate the new drug application nda  expected to be filed by the end of the date of potential commercial approval depends on whether we receive fast track status from the fda 
in case of fast track the fda approval time is maximum six months 
if we are not granted fast track designation  the approval time can take substantially longer  depending on the progress made by the fda in review of the application 
the fda may deny full commercial approval to the drug at any time  including after fast track status has been awarded 
as with any experimental drug being tested for use in treating human diseases  the fda must approve the testing and clinical protocols employed and must render their decision based on the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested 
historically this is a long and costly process 
our me cfs amp clinical study is a phase iii study  which based on favorable results  will serve as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
the fda review process could take months and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
amp and amp as of december  approximately patients had been enrolled in both studies combined and they were being treated in approximately different active sites around the us the length of the study and the costs related to these trials cannot be determined at this time as it will be materially influenced by a the number of clinical investigators needed to fulfill the required number of patients  b the rate of accrual of patients and c the retention of patients on the protocol and their adherence to the protocol requirements 
see amp and amp in result of operations  years ended december  vs 
 research and development costs above 
our overall research and development direct costs in were  compared to direct research and development costs in of  and  in we estimate that of these expenditures to be related to our me cfs research and development and related to our hiv studies 
general and administrative expenses excluding stock compensation expense  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in versus  in this decease in expenses of  in  is due to several factors including the recovery of certain legal expenses of approximately  relating to the asensio lawsuit from our insurance carrier and lower overall legal expenses due to less litigation  partially offset by higher insurance premiums 
stock compensation expenses was  or  lower than recorded in the year the compensation reflects the imputed non cash expense recorded to reflect the cost of warrants granted to outside parties for services rendered to us 
equity loss unconsolidated affiliates during the three months ended june and december  we recorded a non cash charge of  and  respectively  to operations with respect to our  investment in red these charges were the result of our determination that red s business and financial position had deteriorated to the point that our investment had been permanently impaired 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
in may  we acquired an equity interest in chronix biomedical corp 
chronix for  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a noncash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix 
this impairment reduces our carrying value to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on its then proposed equity offerings 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
in april  we acquired a equity position in the california institute of molecular medicine cimm for  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in cimm 
this was a result of our determination that cimm s operations have not yet evolved to the point where the full carrying value of our investment could be supported based on that company s financial position and operating results 
this amount represented the unamortized balance of goodwill included as part of our investment 
during  cimm continued to suffer significant losses resulting in a deterioration of its financial condition 
the  written off during represented the un amortized balance of goodwill included as part of our investment 
additionally  during we reduced our investment in cimm based on our percentage interest in cimm s continued operating losses 
our remaining investment at december  in cimm  representing a interest in cimm s equity at such date  was completely written off during such amount was not material 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated affiliate 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
interest and other income interest and other income totaled  in compared to  recorded in significantly lower interest rates on money market accounts and lower cash available for investment basically account for the difference 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities  which earned much lower interest income in liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was  cash provided by financial activities for twelve months ended december  amounted to  substantially from proceeds from debentures see below 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that these funds plus the net proceeds of approximately million from the recently placed january debentures  the potential receipt of the million of proceeds held back pending the acquisition of the isi facility  potential licensing fee income  the  in proceeds we expect when the investors exercise their additional investment rights  and and the projected revenue from the acquisition of the alferon n injection r business will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements including debt service during the fiscal year 
sales of alferon n injection r could be greater than expected which would improve our cash position during the next twelve months 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
if we do not timely complete the second isi asset acquisition  our financial condition could be adversely affected see the risk factor if we do not complete the second interferon sciences asset acquisition  our ability to generate revenues from the sales of alferon n injection r and our financial condition will be adversely affected

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenues for non refundable license fees are recognized under the performance method expected revenue 
this method considers the total amount of expected revenue during the performance period  but limits the amount of revenue recognized in a period to total non refundable cash received to date 
this limitation is appropriate because future milestone payments are contingent on future events 
upon receipt  the upfront non refundable payment is deferred 
the non refundable upfront payments plus non refundable payments arising from the achievement of defined milestones are recognized as revenue over the performance period based on the lesser of a percentage of completion or b non refundable cash earned including the upfront payment 
this method requires the computation of a ratio of cost incurred to date to total expected costs and then apply that ratio to total expected revenue 
the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the total non refundable cash received to date 
revenue from the sale of ampligen r under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
patents and trademarks effective october   we adopted a year estimated useful life for the amortization of our patents and trademark rights in order to more accurately reflect their useful life 
prior to october   we were using a ten year estimated useful life 
patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the assets 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential on an undiscounted cash basis to support the realizability of our respective capitalized cost 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risks consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at times  we have bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables 
our receivables consist principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk 
market risk we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding requirements  the excess cash was invested in three to six month high quality financial instruments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to any investment exposure
