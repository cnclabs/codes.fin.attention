item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all of these statements are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
executive overview we provide data management solutions that help organizations cost effectively build  optimize  test  and manage their critical data  database  and application infrastructures 
we earn revenues from the world wide sale of these software solutions and related maintenance and support services to corporations  government agencies  educational institutions  and other entities 
it budgets  as well as macroeconomic conditions  affect demand for our products 
in addition  our sales are impacted by competitive conditions  market acceptance of our product offerings  and our execution against sales plans 
we have historically derived a significant percentage of our revenues from our dbartisan product line 
this product line is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of this revenue concentration  our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for  or in the prices of  this product line resulting from any change in pricing model  maturation in the market for this product  increased price competition  or a failure by us to keep up with technological change  among other factors 
in and  global economic conditions had a negative impact on it spending and affected sales of our products 
in the first half of  it spending continued to be depressed 
however  we saw an improvement in license sales in the second half of the year as customers seemed more willing to spend money to bolster their it infrastructures 
in addition  we released new products in  including the dbartisan analyst series  a set of products that extends the depth and functionality of dbartisan  our database management solution 
we experienced good initial sales of the dbartisan analyst series products upon their release in the second quarter of most of our operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities  overhead  outside contractors used for research and development work  and legal and other general and administrative costs 
we reduced operating expenses and headcount in the year  as we believed that we could gain efficiencies in our operations 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  total operating expenses were down  in as compared to we ended the year with employees  down employees from the end of our license and maintenance revenues  results of operations  cash flows from operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods by a renewed downturn in global economic conditions  increased competitive pressures  and our own inability to execute on our sales plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
the impacts and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those items that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
below is further discussion of the items that we consider to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are principally derived from software license sales and related maintenance and support contracts 
customers that license our software products also generally purchase maintenance and support contracts that provide software updates and technical support over a stated term  usually one year 
revenues from maintenance and support contracts are paid for in advance and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
we primarily sell packaged software products that generally do not require us to perform any special installation or integration services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  typically upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  no significant implementation obligations by us remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we use a purchase order  a pre payment via check  wire or credit card  a signed license agreement  or other persuasive evidence as substantiation of an arrangement 
when processing a sales transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are typically days from invoice date but in some cases may be or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
most customers are granted payment terms  but some payments are collected via check  wire  or credit card at the time an order is placed 
for arrangements with multiple elements eg  undelivered maintenance and support contracts and consulting and training services bundled with licenses  we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for the licenses is based upon the prices paid for separate renewal of those services by similar customers 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for other services  primarily consulting and training services  is based upon separate sales of such services 
deferred maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of maintenance and support services that customers have contracted for in advance but for which revenue has not been recognized  is recognized as services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
our products are sold under a perpetual license model 
updates and upgrades to our products are made available to customers who have purchased maintenance and support contracts 
we do not recognize revenues for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
we sell our software and related maintenance services directly through our telesales and field sales organizations in the united states and the united kingdom  and indirectly through our distribution partners worldwide 
revenues from software license fees and maintenance contracts sold through resellers or distributors are recognized on the sell through method 
distributors purchase products to fulfill specific customer orders and generally do not hold inventory of 
table of contents our products 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales activities in an effort to increase revenues from foreign sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reduces our accounts receivable balance  to cover estimated write offs resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make payments 
our allowance is based on the estimated collectibility of outstanding accounts and our historical low levels of bad debt write offs 
when it is known that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for the amount of the obligation that will not be met 
if general financial conditions for our customers were to deteriorate and this affected our customers ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we would have to record additional charges to our allowance to cover any additional projected shortfalls in collections 
capitalized research and development costs 
capitalized research and development costs include certain costs associated with acquiring and developing technology used in our licensed products 
research and development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires capitalization of research and development costs once technological feasibility has been established through such time as the related product is generally available for sale 
we consider technological feasibility to have been established when a working model that includes all significant planned features and functionality exists 
accordingly  purchased technology is capitalized if it has reached technological feasibility at the time of acquisition  costs of developed technology are capitalized after technological feasibility is reached 
costs of purchased and developed technology are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product 
amortization begins when technology is available for sale 
estimated useful lives of capitalized technology are generally three years 
our capitalized software costs were million  net at december  a discussion of our policies related to capitalized software can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading capitalized software development costs and further detail can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
lease related impairment loss 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
lease abandonment costs were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions about the time period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees as well as the sublease rates that can be achieved  as determined by market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage we retained 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional impairment charges to cover lower than estimated sublease income 
we will continue to review these estimates each reporting period 
to the extent that these assumptions change due to unfavorable market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could increase 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a given period  we must increase the tax provision in the statement of operations 

table of contents at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of current and future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
a detailed discussion of our income tax provision and the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for deferred stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
deferred stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  as some options and stock awards granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we amortize stock based compensation using the multiple option method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options and stock awards  which are generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required in order to show our operating income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options and awards under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and stock awards issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income loss and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income loss and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly

table of contents years ended december    and revenues total revenues 
total revenues were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to license 
license revenues were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to the decrease in license revenues from to was due to unfavorable changes in macro economic conditions and the resulting impact on it related spending 
customers were faced with shrinking budgets and tighter internal spending controls  which led to a reduction in it spending and impacted not only our license sales but also those of the software industry as a whole 
the decrease from to was due to continuing unfavorable macro economic conditions which  through the first half of  led to a reduction in it spending 
in the second half of  we experienced an improved sales pipeline and better sales closure rates across our product line  as well as increased customer adoption of new products 
additionally  license sales by our european subsidiary were strong in the fourth quarter of in and  and  respectively  of our revenues were generated internationally 
as we continue to build out our international sales channels  we would like to see the percentage of revenues generated internationally reach or more within the next few years 
future license revenues cannot be predicted and will vary based on it spending patterns  macro economic conditions  demand for dbartisan and our other existing products  acceptance of our new products  changes in product pricing  competitive conditions  and other related factors 
maintenance 
maintenance revenues were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the year over year increase in maintenance revenues in both and was due to the cumulative number of licenses sold and a corresponding increase in our customer base and maintenance renewals 
we require our customers to purchase a one year maintenance contract with most initial license sales 
customers may then opt to renew their maintenance agreements after the initial term  and renewals are typically made in one year increments 
our maintenance revenues are therefore a factor of both new licenses sold as well as the number of customers who opt to renew their maintenance agreements 
future license sales  as well as the percentage of existing license holders who choose to renew their maintenance agreements  will impact our future maintenance revenues but cannot be predicted 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of amortization of capitalized research and development expenses  royalties  credit card merchant fees  product media and packaging  and shipping 
cost of license revenues were   and  for   and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to cost of license revenues represented   and of license revenues in   and  respectively 
the absolute dollar decrease from to was due primarily to a decrease in royalty expenses of  a reduction in us product media and packaging of  and a decrease in us credit card merchant fees of  these were partially offset by an increase of  in amortization of capitalized research and development expenses as there was a full year of amortization expense in for products that were released in the summer of the absolute dollar increase from to was due primarily to a  increase in amortization expense related to capitalized research and development expenses for a product that came to market in this increase was partially offset by a  reduction in product media and packaging 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues may vary in the future depending on the mix of internally developed versus externally licensed products  which would impact our royalty expense 
additionally  our product media and packing fees as well as our shipping costs will vary based on the amount of product shipped to customers  which is affected by the volume of completed license transactions 
future amortization expense for capitalized research and development costs is expected to be approximately  in each of and and  in amortization of acquired technology 
this amortization relates to technology acquired from third parties or in business acquisitions that was deemed to 
table of contents have reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and therefore capitalized see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this expense was million  million  and  for   and  respectively 
in each year  there was  of expense related to technology acquired in the acquisition of advanced software technologies  inc the increase from to was due to the addition of  related to technology acquired in and and put into service in the increase from to was due to a full year of amortization for the technology put into service in future amortization of previously acquired technology related to a business acquisition is expected to be  in and zero thereafter 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of customer support personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  and allocated overhead 
cost of maintenance revenues was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
cost of maintenance revenues represented   and of maintenance revenues in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of maintenance as a percentage of revenues from to to was due primarily to the increase in maintenance revenues from period to period while the number of related personnel remained flat  allowing us to realize economies of scale through increased utilization of our customer support personnel 
we expect to hire more support personnel to support our expanding product line and customer base 
when we hire such personnel  we expect cost of maintenance revenues to increase in absolute dollars and potentially to increase as a percentage of maintenance revenues if the additional personnel are hired in advance of an increase in the related revenues 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  allocated overhead  and non cash stock based compensation  as well as expenses related to outside software development contractors 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were   and in   and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase from to was primarily due to an increase of  related to increased headcount in our canadian subsidiary which led to higher personnel expenses  overhead costs  and bonus payments 
there was also a  increase in recruiting fees  primarily related to the hiring of a new vice president of development  and a  increase in software maintenance expense 
in  we plan to keep the absolute dollar amount of research and development expense relatively consistent with however  we may increase research and development expenses beyond the current plan if we choose to expand our product development activities to take advantage of market opportunities 
purchased research and development 
purchased research and development consists of technology purchased from third parties 
from time to time  we may purchase technology to supplement our research and development efforts and to leverage the resources available to us 
such purchases are for the rights  titles  and interest in the technology 
if we determine that the purchased software has not reached technological feasibility  we expense the cost of the technology in the year of the purchase see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of when purchased technology is expensed versus capitalized 
in  we spent million to purchase technology that had not reached technological feasibility 
the technology was subsequently integrated into our products in  and there are no related contractual obligations for future purchases of technology 
no comparable expense was incurred in or we may choose to purchase additional technology in the future based on our development needs and our decisions to internally build technology versus purchase technology from third parties 
our past purchases and integration of research and development did not created a material strain on our financial or personnel resources 
however  if we choose to purchase additional research and development in the future  such purchases may have a material effect on our financial and or personnel resources 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  commissions earned by sales personnel  non cash stock based compensation  trade shows  travel  and other 
table of contents marketing communication costs  such as advertising and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were   and in   and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  or   and as a percentage of total revenues 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to was due to a reduction in non cash stock based compensation of  as well as a decrease of approximately million in marketing costs due to reductions in discretionary marketing spending 
these decreases were slightly offset by an increase in sales personnel and related expenses as we continued to build out our field sales organization 
excluding stock based compensation  the absolute dollar increase from to was primarily due to a  increase in expenses in our european subsidiary as a result of an increase in the average exchange rate for the pound sterling 
in  we reduced marketing expenses  both personnel related and discretionary marketing spend  which were offset by higher personnel related expenses for sales resulting primarily from increased wages and commissions 
we expect to release new products in to expand our offering as well as enhance our existing product lines 
when and if these products are released  we may increase our marketing efforts to promote the new products and hire new sales personnel to expand our sales capacity  which would lead to an increase in sales and marketing expense in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  general operating expenses  and non cash stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were   and in   and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million or   and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
excluding stock based compensation  the absolute dollar increase from to was due to an increase in expenses in our european subsidiary of approximately  excluding stock based compensation  the increase from to was due to a  increase in legal fees primarily attributable to the legal matter discussed in item legal proceedings  a  increase in personnel related expenses  and a  increase in professional service and insurance expenses  partially offset by a  decrease in expenses for our european subsidiary  primarily due to lower personnel related costs  and a  decrease in bad debt expense 
in connection with the issuance of restricted stock to a key executive  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we expect to incur non cash stock based compensation expense of  in and  in  provided that the executive remains an employee of our company during that time 
in order to comply with certain requirements of sarbanes oxley  we expect to incur additional consulting and audit fees in in addition  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars if we need to expand our administrative staff and facilities to support future growth in our operations 
amortization of other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of advanced software technologies  inc  engineeringperformance  inc  and the remaining of embarcadero europe ltd  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of relating to non technology intangible assets acquired  we recorded million and million of amortization expense in and  respectively  as an operating expense 
these assets were fully amortized as of december  we ceased amortization of goodwill when we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january  see goodwill in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on september  the results of the analysis showed that goodwill was not impaired 
going forward  we will test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
if  in the future  we determine that this goodwill is impaired  we will be required to take a charge at the date of impairment to write down this asset 
the dollar amount of such potential future charge  if any  cannot currently be estimated 

table of contents lease related impairment loss 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to office leases in san francisco and boston when we decided to abandon and sublease these office spaces in order to streamline operations 
the impairment loss consists of approximately million in contractual obligations under the facilities leases  net of estimated sublease income from the projected date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
the remaining  consists of write downs to leasehold improvements and other assets attributable to the abandoned space  as well as other expenses related to securing the sublease arrangements 
when we recorded the lease related impairment loss  we made estimates about sublease costs and income 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional  in impairment loss to cover lower than expected sublease income 
at december   we had a balance of  in accrued restructuring costs for future facilities lease charges 
the san francisco leases expire in june  and the boston leases expire in we will review these estimates each reporting period and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary in the future 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income and was   and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease from to to was due to significant decreases in interest rates  which negatively impacted our interest income 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million   and  in   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to the increase in income before tax 
the decrease in the tax provision from to was due a reduction in amortization expense for items that are not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes  including amortization of deferred stock based compensation and goodwill 
share in loss of joint venture 
in september  we formed a joint venture with aztec software  inc  a california corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of aztec software and technology services limited  an indian company publicly traded on the bombay stock exchange 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  embarcadero and aztec software  inc each contributed million to the venture 
we account for this venture under the equity method of accounting see basis of presentation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for our fifty percent share in the loss of the venture in the years ended december  and  we recorded  net of a tax benefit of  and  net of a tax expense of  respectively  as a loss from joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our investment in this entity was zero and we had no remaining commitments to the entity 
we do not expect to realize any future income or incur any future expense from our investment in this entity 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business to date from cash generated by our operations and proceeds from sales of equity 
in april  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
in  cash provided by operating activities came from million in net income  million in non cash depreciation and amortization charges  million in other non cash items  and a  change in working capital components 
the change in working capital is attributable primarily to a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments made to satisfy certain obligations 
additionally  there was a million increase in accounts receivable as days sales outstanding increased from days to days for the fourth quarters of and  respectively  and deferred revenue increased by million from an increase in maintenance renewals in as compared to in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from million in net income  million in non cash depreciation and amortization charges   in other non cash items  and a million change in working capital components 
the change in working capital components is primarily due to a million increase in deferred revenue due a larger installed customer base and related increase in maintenance renewals 

table of contents in  our net income was reduced by a number of non cash expense items 
the items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  developed technology  and intangible assets as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
to the extent that these non cash items increase or decrease and positively or negatively impact our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collections efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms extended to our customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our operating cash flows may be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million for   and  respectively

in september  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of our common stock 
in july  our board of directors amended the stock repurchase program  allowing us to repurchase up to  shares in addition to the shares previously repurchased 
in the years ended december    and  we repurchased approximately   and  shares  respectively  at a cost of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
this use of cash was offset in   and by million   and million  respectively  provided by exercises of stock options under our stock option plan 
as of december   there were million shares available for repurchase 
we have no immediate plans for use of our previously repurchased shares 
since december   we have not used cash to repurchase shares of our common stock  but we may resume stock repurchases in the future 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a bank that bears interest at the prime rate and expires on june  this facility requires that we maintain various quarterly financial covenants including covenants related to tangible net worth  total liabilities  and profitability 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants and had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
we have no immediate plans to borrow any amounts under this credit facility 
in total  cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  increased by million over december  between these two balance sheet dates  however  cash and cash equivalents increased by million and short term investments decreased by million 
we held more in cash and cash equivalents at december  due to the maturation of certain investments during we decided not to reinvest in similar investments due to the relatively low yields offered 
we will continue to evaluate our options and may resume buying longer term investments when the yields improve 
we had net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  we believe that these assets will be realizable in the future 

table of contents at december   our only contractual obligations consisted of facility lease commitments and operating leases for office equipment 
future minimum lease payments are as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases total minimum lease payments we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next to months 
if we fail to generate cash flow from operations in the future due to an unexpected decline in revenues or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of revenues generated  our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations without obtaining additional financing 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee or an indemnification 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees or indemnifications that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees and indemnifications issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we fully adopted fin in the first quarter of the disclosure requirements are contained within note of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements  and the impact of the recognition and initial measurement of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
it explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation  as amended  applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  because we do not currently have any unconsolidated variable interest entities  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  the adoption of sfas no

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and  as a result  our stock price may fluctuate or decline 
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical results of operations are not indicative of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the factors discussed below under the captions our operating results would be harmed if information technology spending does not recover  if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share  large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue  our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met  we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment  we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly  if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost  and acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
seasonal variations in orders for our products also contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are likely to cause corresponding volatility in our stock price  particularly if our operating results vary from analysts expectations 
if sales of dbartisan fall  our revenues and income may decline 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our dbartisan product family 
in each of the last three years  sales from our dbartisan product family accounted for over one third to one half of our license revenues 
we expect that sales of dbartisan will continue to represent a substantial portion of our license revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  many of our customers initiate a relationship with us by purchasing dbartisan 
if demand for dbartisan declines due to competition  technological change or other factors  our revenues and income may decline significantly 
if we do not generate new business from our existing customers and add new customers  we will not be able to sustain or increase our revenues 
our license arrangements generally do not provide for substantial ongoing license or maintenance payments 
therefore  our future revenue growth depends on our success in expanding our relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers 
our ability to expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the performance  quality  breadth  and depth of our current and future products and maintenance 
our failure to expand relationships with existing customers or to add new customers would reduce our future license and maintenance revenues 
in addition  if our existing customers do not renew their support contracts  our future maintenance revenues will be adversely affected 
our operating results would be harmed if information technology spending does not recover 
the markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions 
the information technology industry continues to be depressed due to general economic conditions 
we believe that the current economic situation has had an impact on capital spending for database technology and related products 
although there are signs of a recovery  we are uncertain as to how quickly a recovery will take hold and impact demand for capital and technology spending 
any further slowdowns in the 
table of contents database market or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and our results of operations would be harmed 
we invest heavily in research and development with no guarantee of return from the investments that we make 
we have invested significant resources in the development of new products 
if our new products are not accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve future revenue growth and may have limited return on the investments that we have made 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and could fail to achieve expected returns from future investments 
if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  and changes in customer demands and industry standards 
our success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products  introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and market conditions  satisfy increasingly complicated customer requirements  integrate our products with multiple database platforms  and modify our products as database platforms change 
however  due to the nature of computing environments  new products and product enhancements could require longer development and testing periods than we currently anticipate 
the recent economic downturn has also made it more difficult for new products to gain acceptance in the market 
moreover  if we develop new products that do not achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to recoup development and marketing expenses  which could harm our operating results 
the introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
delays in the general availability of new releases or problems in the installation or implementation of new releases could harm our business and operating results 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards  or customer requirements 
our failure to do so would render our products obsolete and could harm our ability to compete 
in addition  our products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue 
since  large sales of our products and maintenance to individual customers have increased 
this is due to our sales efforts to sell larger deals of our traditional software  as well as the introduction of new products that have significantly higher starting prices and longer evaluation periods than our traditional products 
these large sales typically involve sales cycles between six and twelve months  which is considerably longer than our sales cycle prior to this lengthy sales cycle is due to the need to educate and convince prospective customers of the value of our products and to gain approval from more constituencies within a prospective account  including key management personnel 
the timing of our revenues has become more difficult to forecast because of this lengthy sales cycle for large sales 
we may expend substantial time and resources to negotiate transactions with prospective customers but then be delayed in concluding  or be unable to conclude  sales of our products and maintenance 
any delay in  or failure to complete  sales in a particular period would reduce our revenues in that period as well as in subsequent periods over which revenues for the sale may be recognized 
if we were to experience a delay on one or more large orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given period 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large sales  it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met 
the majority of our operating expenses consist of personnel and related expenses and facility related costs 
these costs are relatively fixed in the short term  and our operating decisions such as when to hire additional personnel and when to expand our facilities and infrastructure are based in large part on expectations about expected future revenues 
if we hire personnel and enter into facilities contracts based on our expectations about future revenues  and then fail to meet those revenue expectations  we would likely have lower than expected earnings per share  which would negatively affect our stock price 
we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and  as a result  we have ceased amortization of goodwill 
going forward  we will be required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
we performed an impairment test in september and determined that  at that time  there had been no impairment to goodwill 
at december   our goodwill balance totaled million 
in the future  if we determine that this goodwill has been impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge to write down this asset  which would adversely affect our earnings and book value 
we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
in recent years  software revenue recognition rules have been under heavy review and interpretation by various accounting authoritative and regulatory bodies  including the american institute for certified public accountants and the financial accounting standards board 
these reviews and interpretations have resulted in significant changes in the practices and standards for recognizing revenues in software companies 
there could be further changes in these standards 
we may have to change our methods of revenue recognition to comply with new standards  and any such change could cause deferment of revenues recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  either of which could cause shortfalls in meeting securities analysts and investors expectations in any period 
any such shortfalls could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
the expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks 
we expect to continue to expand our international sales and research and development operations 
as a result  we could face a number of risks from our expanding international operations  including staffing and managing foreign operations  increased financial accounting and reporting complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  the loss of revenues and net income resulting from currency fluctuations  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  the impact of war or terrorist activities  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer sales and payment cycles  and costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries 
further expansion of our international operations may require significant management attention and financial resources and may place burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our possible investments to establish facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenues or profitability  which would negatively affect our stock price 
if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost 
computer software such as ours often contains undetected errors and may contain design flaws 
errors may be found in current versions  new versions  or enhancements of our products after we make commercial shipments 
if our software contains undetected errors  performs unreliably  or if we otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations  we may suffer loss of revenues  market share or customers  negative publicity and harm to our reputation  diversion of research and development and management resources  
table of contents increased maintenance and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
we may lose market share and be required to reduce prices as a result of competition from our existing competitors and other independent software vendors and developers of software 
the market for our products is highly competitive  dynamic  and subject to rapidly changing technology 
pricing pressure in the market has increased as competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more aggressive discounting 
if such pricing pressure continues  it could have an adverse effect on our margins 
we compete primarily against other providers of data and database management  data performance and availability  enterprise data design and modeling  and data movement technologies  which include computer associates  quest software  bmc software  ibm rational software  borland software corporation  informatica corporation  ascential software  and other independent software vendors 
our products also compete with products offered by database software manufacturers  including oracle  microsoft  sybase and ibm 
some of these competing products are provided at no charge to their customers 
we expect that companies such as oracle  microsoft  sybase  and ibm will continue to develop and incorporate into their products applications which compete with our products and may take advantage of their substantial technical  financial  marketing and distribution resources in those efforts 
we may not be able to compete effectively with those products or efforts  which could significantly harm our business and operating results 
there has been consolidation in our industry  such as ibm s acquisition of rational software and borland software corporation s acquisition of togethersoft 
these and any future acquisitions may have the effect of improving the competitive positions of the acquired companies and weakening our competitive situation 
to effectively compete as the industry consolidates  we may need to seek alliances with other companies in order to gain better acceptance of our products 
we may not be able to enter into such alliances on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  if the market for application and data lifecycle management products grows  some of our competitors may increase their focus on offering software directly competitive with ours  whether by internal development  external development  or acquisition 
our competitors may also attempt to keep us from integrating our software with theirs  making it more difficult for our customers to adopt our software 
if such increased competition were to result in resistance to integration of our software with the software of these competitors  we may have difficulty entering markets where our competitors have strong market positions 
further  if a single database platform were to gain a considerably larger share of the database market than other database platforms  we would lose our multi platform competitive advantage and our sales would suffer 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
they also may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in technology or customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products on acceptable terms 
our competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our products obsolete  unmarketable or otherwise less competitive  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other companies  thereby enhancing the functionality of their products  or establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with channel or strategic partners which limit our ability to sell or to co market products through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share  reduce customer orders  reduce gross margins  or require us to reduce our prices  any of which would harm our operating results 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will not be able to grow 
our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing  research and development  and support personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
our vice president of sales recently resigned  and it may take us some time to find a qualified person to replace him 
additionally  we may 
table of contents miss sales targets in the interim if our sales cycle is disrupted 
if we lose the services of any of our other executive officers or key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our ability to manage our business effectively could be harmed 
our business will not be able to grow if we cannot attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
despite the recent economic downturn  competition for qualified employees remains intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate  or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support  and develop our products effectively 
some of our current employees and those that we seek to hire may be subject to non competition or non solicitation covenants that could further limit our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
we may make strategic acquisitions of companies  products  or technologies as necessary in order to implement our business strategy 
if we make acquisitions and are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions and the revenues and operating results of the combined company may decline 
any acquisition may temporarily disrupt our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
in addition  acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated liabilities or risks  including litigation and the costs and uncertainties related to legal proceedings 
for example  we are currently a defendant in litigation related to our acquisition of engineeringperformance  inc  in november as the litigation is at an early stage and is uncertain  we are unable to predict an outcome at this time 
as the alleged damages and related claims against the company are considerable  an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flow 
while we have financed our acquisitions to date primarily with working capital  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer due to acquisition related expenses 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
increased international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  enhanced national security measures  sustained military action in afghanistan and iraq  strained international relations with foreign governments and other international conflicts  may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs  and may adversely affect our stock price 
this increased instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively affect the desire of our employees and customers to travel  adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates  or require us to take extra security precautions for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  this international political instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and infringement claims or independent development of competing technologies could harm our competitive position 
we rely on copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and attempt to restrict access to proprietary information on a need to know basis 
despite such precautions  unauthorized third parties may be able to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we consider as proprietary 
we license our software products primarily under shrink wrap licenses delivered electronically with our software products 
shrink wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees and purport to take effect upon installation of the product or downloading of the product from the internet 
these measures afford only limited protection 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as united states laws 

table of contents we may have to enter into litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others with respect to our rights 
litigation is generally very expensive and can divert the attention of management from daily operations 
accordingly  any intellectual property litigation could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 
we are not aware of any case in which we are infringing the proprietary rights of others 
however  third parties may bring infringement claims against us 
any such claim is likely to be time consuming and costly to defend  could cause product delays and could force us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements with third parties 
a successful infringement claim against us could require us to enter into a license or royalty agreement with the claimant or develop alternative technology 
however  we may not be able to negotiate favorable license or royalty agreements  if any  in connection with such claims and we may fail to develop alternative technology on a timely basis 
accordingly  a successful product infringement claim against us could harm our business and operating results 
we are susceptible to business interruptions that could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism  and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in san francisco  which is known for seismic activity 
although we have a disaster recovery plan for critical data and business applications  this does not provide assurance that we would not suffer a business interruption 
a significant business interruption would result in losses or damages incurred by us and would harm our business 
our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that might occur  which would result in increased expenses and harm our operating results 
certain persons have substantial control over us  which could impede stockholder approval of certain transactions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially held of our outstanding common stock as of february  in addition  despite their sales of our common stock over the past year  some of our founders who are no longer associated with us continue to hold a significant amount of our common stock 
these groups of stockholders can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the approval of equity compensation plans  the election of directors and the approval of mergers  or other business combination transactions 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile  making it difficult for our stockholders to predict the return on their investment 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in market valuation of software and technology companies  quarterly variations in our operating results  global and domestic economic and political conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements that we or our competitors make related to significant contracts  acquisitions  capital commitments  strategic partnerships or product introductions or enhancements  additions or departures of key personnel  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly volatile among securities of software and internet companies  and sales of significant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
some of our founders who are no longer associated with the company continue to hold significant amounts of our common stock 
sales of our common stock by these founders cannot be controlled by us and may add to the volatility of our stock price 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts that might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are subject to the provisions of delaware law that restrict business combinations with interested stockholders  which may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combinations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio  which at december  included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
the values of these securities are likely to decline if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short maturities of our investments  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign exchange risk our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and are denominated in united states dollars 
a small but growing portion of our sales originate through our european subsidiary and are denominated in pounds sterling 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations in the pound sterling relative to the united states dollar 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange contracts generally offset the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  use of these instruments is not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recorded a loss from derivatives of  in  which was recorded as other income  net on the statement of operations 
we did not use derivative financial instruments in or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions ie pounds sterling  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to our near term financial condition or results of operations
