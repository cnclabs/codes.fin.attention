item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir was founded in  originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors  windows  walls and roofs of each house 
as demand for that application declined  the company began to focus on other applications and markets for its technology  in particular  designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement 
since then  the company has continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and has now become one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and government markets  internationally as well as domestically 
our business is now organized around two principal business segments  thermography and imaging 
the thermography market primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences  which is useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications 
uses for our thermography products include predictive and preventative maintenance  process control  condition monitoring  moisture detection and scientific analysis 
in  we introduced a new inexpensive camera  known as the e series  that has increased the number of markets and applications that thermography serves 
our thermography products are produced at our facility in sweden 
a growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and developing markets and applications worldwide 
our imaging business offers a wide array of products  all of which allow the user to see in total darkness  and through many types of obscurants  such as smoke  haze and most types of fog 
product offerings include hand held and fixed mounted products for ground  airborne and maritime applications 
applications for our imaging products include force protection  counter terrorism  search and rescue  perimeter security  navigation safety  law enforcement  narcotics detection  maritime and border patrol  electronic news gathering  anti piracy and firefighting 
our imaging products are primarily produced at our portland  boston and sweden facilities 
a substantial portion of our revenue in the imaging business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business  both in the united states and internationally 
we continue to enhance our state of the art products within both business segments  as well as develop products for new market applications that use advanced thermal imaging technologies 
for example  uncooled detector technology used in our thermography systems enable these systems to operate at room temperature  allowing for systems that are less expensive  smaller  lighter  and more energy efficient 
for our imaging products  we are continually improving the performance of our systems by utilizing our skills in system design  systems integration  and improving component performance  while also improving the stabilization of our airborne systems and offering additional imaging options  such as ccd tv cameras  laser rangefinders and laser designators 
on october   we announced the acquisition of indigo systems corporation which is located in goleta santa barbara  california 
indigo is a leading producer of infrared detectors  infrared cameras  and camera subsystems 
the acquisition of indigo provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors  both cooled and uncooled  for both our imaging and thermography business 
indigo will also allow us to expand our presence in certain markets  including high end scientific cameras  oem s and certain military program markets 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue 
with the production and distribution of our thermography products in sweden contributing a large volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other 
table of contents currencies 
during  there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which we conduct business  in particular  a weakening of the us dollar 
the impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements  but in aggregate  did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company typically experiences longer payment cycles on its international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon the company s liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of the company s operations are conducted outside the united states  including manufacturing in sweden and sales operations worldwide 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
the company experiences fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december sab clarified existing guidance  principally those provided by sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  regarding revenues for contracts that contain multiple elements 
we design  market and sell our products as commercial  off the shelf products 
many of our imaging customers  particularly those who use our airborne systems  request different system configurations  based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts  we recognize revenue only after we have determined that elements with stand alone 
table of contents values have been delivered and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory write downs 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory write downs of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
cost basis investments 
flir has invested in two third party entities 
the investments are accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have controlling interests in these entities nor do have we the ability to exercise significant influence on them 
as of december   we have carrying values of these investments  including debt  of approximately million 
we periodically review the investments for impairment to determine if events or changes in the business conditions of those entities indicate the carrying value of our investments may not be recoverable 
these reviews may be based upon factors that include  but are not limited to  hypothetical liquidations of the investees at book value and current or recent financings received by the investees 
if future changes in business results or market conditions indicate that any impairment  other than temporary  exists on these investments  we may need to record reserves against those investments 
goodwill impairment 
the company recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of agema infrared systems ab in during the year ended december   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 

table of contents we review goodwill in june of each year for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundary of the overall market capitalization of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill asset  which has a carrying value of million as of december  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense interest income other expense income  net earnings before income taxes income tax provision net earnings 
table of contents years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue reported in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in revenue from the thermography business segment increased from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly in our maritime products  and a shift in the mix of shipments of our ground based  law enforcement and broadcast products to higher priced systems 
the thermography revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly the e series products and in the predictive maintenance market segments 
the unit increases are due to increases in capital spending as worldwide economies have improved and also due to penetration into new markets and the identification of additional applications 
approximately one fifth of the increase in total revenue  as well as the increase in both segments  was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates during revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue reported in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in  while the thermography business segment reported a revenue increase of from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly in our ground based products  and the mix of shipments within our airborne product offerings 
the thermography revenue increase was due to greater unit volume shipments  primarily due to the market acceptance of our new e series products  offset by the lower prices associated with the e series products and reductions in capital spending by our customer base which impacted our higher priced thermography products 
international revenue in totaled million  representing of revenue 
this compares to international revenue in which totaled million  representing of revenue  and million  or of revenue in while the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year  we anticipate the mix to be approximately domestic and international on a long term basis 
gross profit 
gross profit in was of revenue  compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in the thermography business over the imaging business as a percentage of revenue 
in  the thermography revenue was of total revenue  compared to of total revenue in we historically experience higher gross margins in our thermography business than in our imaging business 
the increased use of distributors  whose commissions are reported as a reduction of revenue  in the thermography business has partially offset the increase in gross profit percentage attributable to the change in the mix between the business segments 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in was compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the change in relative mix of revenue from our business segments 
in  imaging revenue represented of our total revenue compared to of total revenue in research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to represent to of our revenue on a long term basis 
research and development expenses were million during compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in compared to million  or of revenue in the decrease in 
table of contents expenses as a percentage of revenue was a result of the revenue increase during the year and the ability to manage spending growth at a lower level than the revenue growth 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in the increase in spending was primarily due to the increase in selling and marketing expenses arising from the general business and revenue growth during  partially offset by a reduction of million in expenses from to related to the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill in interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in interest from to is primarily due to the accrual of a partial year of interest on the convertible notes that were issued in june the decrease in interest from to was due primarily to the reduction in debt as the company was able to use cash from operations and the proceeds from its december follow on common stock offering to repay its outstanding debt 
the company s outstanding indebtedness under its primary credit agreement declined from million at the beginning of to million at the end of and was paid in full in february interest expense for and also includes expenses associated with the company s interest rate swap agreements in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the swap agreements were settled during interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in was due to the invested cash for the second half of the year as a result of the june issuance of the convertible notes 
other expense income 
the company reported other expenses of million for  other expenses of million for and other income of million in the significant increase in other expense in was due to currency losses on transactions denominated in currencies in other than the functional currency of the company s european operations as the european currencies strengthened significantly against the us dollar during income taxes 
the company s income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between the company s us and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years  but changes in the company s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in and related to our assessment of the ability to realize the deferred tax assets generated by prior tax loss benefits had the result of keeping the effective tax rates in those years lower 
at december   the company had us tax net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling million which expire in the years through additionally  the company has various us tax credits available aggregating million  which expire in the years through the company has generated deductions for us tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in its nols 
the utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in the company s tax provision 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  management believes that the deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and has not recorded a valuation allowance 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including but not limited to continued growth of the thermography and imaging markets  competitive pressures on sales and gross 
table of contents margins  successful implementation of tax planning strategies  and other factors beyond the company s control 
no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if its future forecasts of taxable income are not achieved 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily from the proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in june and cash provided from operations  less the cash used for capital expenditures and to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories during at december   the company had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the increase of million in the receivable balance is primarily due to an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of approximately million of the increase in receivables is attributable to the change in currency rates from the end of at december   the company had inventories of million compared to million at december  the increase in inventories is primarily due to the general growth of the business and the anticipation of production demands as evidenced by the december  order backlog of million 
the increase in work in progress inventories accounts for of the total increase in inventories 
additionally  approximately million of the total increase in inventories relates to the change in currency rates during the year 
at december   the company had prepaid expenses and other current assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a net increase in the number of demonstration units and an increase in supplier advances 
the company s investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
capital expenditures during include the purchase of a new building for the boston operations for million 
investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  consisting primarily of expenditures for fixed assets  including the relocation of certain of the company s operations in at december   the company had other long term assets of million compared to million at december  the increase primarily relates to insurance investment contracts purchased during the year and a long term portion of a customer receivable 
accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase relates to the increase in inventories and the general growth of the company s business 
other current liabilities at december  were million  an increase of million from the end of the increase was related to an increase in commissions payable to sales representatives and the accrual of interest on the convertible debt 
pension and other long term liabilities increased million  from million at december  to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the increase in accrued expenses associated with the supplemental executive retirement plan 

table of contents the company maintains a credit agreement with bank of america  na  keybank  na  and union bank of california  na the agreement  dated march  and amended june   provides for a million  three year revolving line of credit with an option for an additional million until september  under the credit agreement  borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the bank of america or eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread over such rates based upon the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 
the credit agreement contains five financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain fixed charge and leverage ratios in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth and a maximum level of capital expenditures 
the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and was in compliance with all covenants 
the company  through two of its subsidiaries  has a million swedish kroner approximately million line of credit at and a million line of credit at at december  at december   the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines 
the million swedish kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the applicable subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
on july   the million swedish kroner credit agreement replaced the old agreement of million swedish kroner with the same terms 
the million line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of the applicable subsidiary and is subject to renegotiation annually 
in june  the company issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the issuance was made through an initial offering of million made on june   and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional million on june  the net proceeds from the issuance were approximately million 
issuance costs are being amortized over a period of seven years 
interest is payable semiannually on june and december of each year beginning on december  the holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustments  prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances 
these circumstances generally include a the market price of the company s common stock exceeding of the conversion price  b the company calling the notes for redemption  c the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or d if the notes become rated and such rating is lowered by two or more rating levels 
the company may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after june  note holders have the right to require the company to purchase their notes on or after june  the proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes  which include the acquisition of indigo systems corporation and other working capital and capital expenditure needs 
during the year ended december   the company used million in cash to purchase million shares of the company s common stock 
on october   the company and indigo systems corporation indigo entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the company will acquire indigo 
indigo security holders will receive cash consideration of approximately million  and all outstanding indigo stock options will be converted into options to purchase flir stock 
the transaction is valued  excluding acquisition related costs  at approximately million and was closed on january  while the successful completion of the indigo transaction consumed a significant portion of our cash as of december   we believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities  and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
except as described above  we do not have any significant capital commitments for the coming year 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
we also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements 
except for these operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the forward looking statements section provided at the beginning of this annual report on form k  the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
in addition  you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant 
if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will work 
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
factors that may affect our future operating results include the timing  number and size of orders from  and shipments to  our customers  as well as the relative mix of those orders  variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter  which can be substantial  may result in variations in revenue and gross margins  a significant portion of our sales are made in the last month of each quarter  with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter  the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products  product enhancements or technologies  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components  the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products  changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  
table of contents the timing and amount of any inventory write downs  foreign currency fluctuations  costs and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of other businesses  product lines or technologies  and general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
seasonal fluctuations in our operating results  particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter  result from the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
we have had difficulties managing our growth 
our operations have become global  and our revenue has grown from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  in the past  we experienced problems in developing and implementing a financial reporting and controls system commensurate with the substantial growth and increased complexity of our business 
we have taken a number of steps to improve our controls and systems 
however  if these and other measures we take are inadequate to address the growth we continue to experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully integrate indigo systems  or any future acquisition or equity investment  into our operations  thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  we completed the acquisition of indigo systems corporation  which is located in goleta santa barbara  california 
we intend to integrate indigo s cooled and uncooled infrared detectors into our thermography and imaging products  thereby lowering our product costs  and begin selling some of indigo s infrared camera cores and camera systems 
this integration of businesses  personnel  product lines and technologies is typically difficult  time consuming and subject to a number of risks 
for example  the integration of indigo infrared detectors into our existing products requires extensive engineering and manufacturing effort that may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful 
further  the integration of products and product lines requires the coordination of research and development  manufacturing  sales  marketing and service efforts between the company and indigo or any future acquisitions 
because the indigo acquisition occurred so recently  we have had limited experience managing their operations 
additionally  we could lose the key personnel from indigo or any future companies that we acquire  incur unanticipated costs and assume new liabilities 
any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and decrease our revenue 
furthermore  we might have to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership 
while there are currently no such acquisitions planned or being negotiated  we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses  product lines or technologies 
as a result  no assurance can be given that we will realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of indigo  or any future acquisition or equity investment  or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are under a cease and desist order from the sec  a violation of which could harm our business 
on june   the sec issued a formal order of investigation of us and certain officers  directors  employees and other individuals presently and formerly associated with us to determine whether any violations 
table of contents of the federal securities laws occurred during and the investigation relates to our revenue recognition policies  accounting controls  financial reports and other public disclosures during that time period 
pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by us on september   the sec instituted and simultaneously settled a proceeding against us under section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section c of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
without admitting or denying the allegations of the sec s order  we agreed to the entry of an order requiring that we cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities act and the antifraud  periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws set forth in section a of the securities act and sections b  a  b a and b b of the exchange act and rules b  b  a and a thereunder 
we incurred no financial fine or penalty under the terms of settlement 
the sec s order stated that we materially overstated our earnings before income taxes for each of the quarters of and as well as for fiscal year  and that our revenue recognition practices resulted in material misstatements and omissions in the financial statements contained in our annual report on form k as originally filed for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q as originally filed for each of the first three quarters of both and in and  we restated our financial statements for and no further restatements of our financial statements were required by the order  and the entry of the order did not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
should we be found to have violated the terms of the sec s order in the future  we may be subject to further enforcement action  including legal action imposing injunctive relief and assessing fines or penalties  which could have a material impact on our business 
a reduction in government purchasing or our inability to act as a united states government contractor could significantly decrease revenue 
the government procurement process is complex and highly competitive 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to united states and foreign government agencies  and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales 
no sales to a single agency of the united states government accounted for more than of our revenue last year  but aggregate sales to united states government agencies accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
however  no one agency accounted for more than of total sales in either period 
accordingly  our results of operations would be adversely impacted by governmental spending cuts and general budgetary constraints 
further  because most of our government sales are not made for defense applications  if the united states government reduces its non military spending as a result of increases in military spending due to instability in iraq and elsewhere  or other developments  our revenues could be adversely affected 
conversely  a significant reduction in purchases of thermal imaging systems for defense applications could result in certain of our competitors committing more attention and resources to non defense applications  thereby increasing competitive pressures in our primary markets 
in addition  we are seeking to secure additional government contracts for the design and long term supply of commercially developed military qualified thermal imaging devices 
if we are not successful in winning such contracts  or do not perform our obligations on any such contracts we do secure  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
our ability to do business with the united states government is conditioned upon our continuing eligibility to act as a federal contractor 
a significant decline in our sales to united states or foreign governments or our disqualification from making such sales for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete 
the market for thermal imaging equipment is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions  enhancements and modifications 
our success will depend in large part on 
table of contents our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements 
we may need to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce new products and enhancements 
if we fail to develop and introduce new technologies in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
from time to time  we or our competitors may announce new products  product enhancements or technological innovations that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our products and that may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products  resulting in inventory obsolescence 
we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products and manage the costs associated with producing numerous product lines to be successful 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements 
for example  our near term success will depend on the continued acceptance of the star safire imaging product line and the thermacam p series and e series thermography product lines  sales of which we expect to generate a substantial amount of our revenue 
we are also investing a significant amount of our financial resources in the enhancement of some of our other existing products 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete these enhancements within the necessary time period or that customers will accept our new products  or any future products 
in addition  the complexity associated with the production of multiple product lines may inhibit our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins 
our failure to complete the enhancement of these products  the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance or our failure to successfully manage our cost of production could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging  develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features  reliability and price 
additionally  our products compete indirectly with numerous other products  such as image intensifiers and low light cameras  for limited governmental and military funds 
finally  many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
all of these factors result in greater challenges from our existing competitors as well as increasing competition from new competitors and require us to continue to invest in  and focus on  research and development and new product innovation 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products and our transition to manufacturing our own cooled and uncooled infrared detectors exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand  increased costs and loss of revenue 
we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products  particularly cooled and uncooled infrared detectors 
we have recently completed the acquisition of indigo systems corporation  which manufactures cooled and uncooled infrared detectors  and intend to use those detectors in our thermography and imaging products 
accordingly  during this transition to the use of indigo s infrared detectors  we could experience a shortage in the supply of some of our components including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors 
in particular  we are winding up a contract with bae systems bae for the supply of uncooled detectors for integration into our thermacam pm  thermacam p series  thermacam e series  thermovision a  thermovision a  thermovision security  thermovision sentry and fireflir product lines 
bae is currently one of three large producers of specialized uncooled detectors 
subject to certain exceptions  the contract gives us the exclusive right to purchase uncooled 
table of contents detectors for use in the commercial market and a limited  non exclusive right to purchase uncooled detectors for use in the government market 
under the contract  we have the corresponding obligation to purchase uncooled detectors solely from bae for certain defined commercial applications 
currently  the thermacam pm  thermacam p series  thermacam e series  thermovision a  thermovision security  thermovision sentry and fireflir product lines use the bae detectors 
with the conclusion of this contract  bae is no longer bound by this exclusivity requirement for the commercial market 
after expiration of the contract  which we expect to occur in  we may not be able to successfully transition to the use of uncooled detectors from indigo systems 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that i we are unable to acquire  or bae is unable to supply  the requisite number of detectors to satisfy our needs during the remaining term of our contract with bae  ii we are unable to transition to uncooled detectors manufactured by indigo systems within the expected time period  or iii the detectors we receive from bae or manufacture at indigo systems are defective or do not otherwise meet our performance standards 
failure by us to transition to the use of cooled and uncooled detectors made by indigo systems  or identify another source of uncooled detectors in a timely manner  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on past experience  we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components 
if the components provided by bae or any other significant supplier become unavailable  our manufacturing operations would be disrupted 
unless we have sufficient lead time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components  we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices 
any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in maintaining and obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad  and the united states congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments 
export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act  the trading with the enemy act of and the arms export control act of for export of many of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses 
recently  heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our market has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications 
failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales  and these expenses are largely fixed  particularly in the short term 
in addition  to enable us to promptly fill orders  we maintain inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials 
as a result  we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales 
accordingly  we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales 
any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs 
we may not carry adequate reserves to offset such write downs or write offs 
our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel 
our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key senior managerial  technical and sales personnel or our 
table of contents ability to attract  integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future 
we also cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have significantly increased our indebtedness as a result of the sale of the convertible notes 
in june  we issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of as a result of this indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations have increased substantially 
increased debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations 
we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for  and are expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the imposition of governmental controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  trade restrictions  difficulty in collecting receivables  inadequate protection of intellectual property  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  and general economic conditions 
historically  currency fluctuations have affected our operating results 
changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused  and could in the future cause  fluctuations in our operating results 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating  where possible  our international sales in united states dollars 
with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive 
no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims 
we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions 
while we have not yet had to recall a product  if any of our products are defective  we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on 
table of contents our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  product defects could result in substantial product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms 
our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
most of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents  making them more difficult to protect 
although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products  we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology  products and trade names 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
likewise  we cannot be certain that measures taken to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure 
any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because intellectual property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours 
litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry 
we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel 
an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  our business could be harmed 
we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities 
we manufacture our products at facilities located in the portland  boston and stockholm areas 
our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of  for example  a prolonged power shortage  fire or other natural disaster  would prevent us from supplying products to our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders 
other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us 
an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders  including an increase in the value of our common stock 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  including our shareholder rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders  as well as provisions of oregon law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows 
at december   no amounts were outstanding on any of the company s credit agreements  consequently  no sensitivity analysis is presented 
the company s convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair value of the notes at december   was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million 
the company has assets  liabilities  and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom 
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
because the company markets  sells and licenses our products throughout the world  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings
