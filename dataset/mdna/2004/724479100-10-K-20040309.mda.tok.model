overview in  we were able to continue our transformation for long term growth 
we achieved this by staying focused on our strategic priorities  which include enhancing our core businesses  streamlining our infrastructure and executing our growth strategies 
approximately of our revenue is recurring due primarily to our large lease and business service contract base and this helps us mitigate the impact of economic conditions 
in  we liquidated approximately million of non core capital services assets in connection with our previously announced strategy to cease originating large ticket  structured  third party  financing of non core lease assets and continued to pursue opportunities to reduce our exposure to non core lease assets on an economically advantageous basis 
our remaining investment in capital services lease related assets included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  was billion 
we also adopted a formal restructuring plan to undertake initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment 
we acquired ddd company ddd which expanded our presence in the important government sector and we also significantly expanded our presort network to sites throughout the us in  revenue increased  income from continuing operations increased and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to compared with in revenue growth for was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and by the acquisitions of ddd and psi group  inc psi  which more than offset the negative impact of lower revenue from non core capital services financing 
in  income from continuing operations was reduced by pre tax restructuring charges of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share and pre tax contributions to charitable foundations of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share 
in  income from continuing operations was increased by pre tax income of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share resulting from the favorable resolution of contingencies related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit that was settled in in  income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash pre tax capital services charge of approximately million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share  related to a write down of our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leasing  and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to the rapid deterioration of the us airline industry 
diluted earnings per share included cents from non core capital services in compared with cents per diluted share in during  we generated million of cash from operating activities  repurchased million shares of our common stock and increased our common stock dividend for the twenty second consecutive year 
we believe that the challenges of will be very similar to as the headwind of lower earnings from our non core capital services business will continue into and we anticipate higher benefits and other non controllable costs 
see results of continuing operations for  and below for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations 
results of continuing operations compared to business segment revenue the following table shows revenue in and by business segment dollars in millions change global mailstream solutions global enterprise solutions total messaging solutions non core core capital services total revenue total messaging solutions revenue grew over the prior year 
the revenue increase came from growth in the global mailstream solutions and global enterprise solutions segments of and  respectively  over global mailstream solutions revenue increased over the prior year driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of psi 
revenue was negatively impacted by delayed decision making by customers for equipment upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our product line due to business and economic uncertainty 
global mailstream solutions revenue in the us grew driven by growth in small business mailing products and presort operations partially offset by lower financing and sales revenue from slower equipment sales 
within the global mailstream solutions segment  international mailing revenue increased primarily as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency 
on a local currency basis  canada  france and the nordic countries experienced good revenue growth 
canada s revenue grew on a local currency basis due to increased leasing of equipment  improved support services revenue and strong placements of new digital meter systems and high end production mailing systems 
france s revenue grew on a local currency basis due to the integration and success of the secap sa secap organization 
this revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in some european countries  such as germany  and asia where economic conditions deteriorated and as a result demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment 
global enterprise solutions revenue increased over the prior year driven by a increase at pbms and an increase at dmt 
pbms revenue increased over the prior year as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of ddd  which more than offset the adverse impact of contraction of business in large enterprise accounts 
contraction of business in the telecommunications  financial services and transaction based legal services industries continued to have an adverse impact on pbms revenue growth and operating margins  which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in the acquisition of ddd demonstrates pbms strategy to accelerate diversification into the government sector as well as to expand cross selling opportunities 
the diversification of its customer base will help offset the weakness that still exists in many other customer segments 
dmt revenue increased over the prior year driven by sales of dmt s inserter and sortation equipment 
dmt was adversely impacted during the first half of by reduced capital spending as businesses continued to delay large capital spending decisions  which in turn slowed worldwide demand for our high speed  software enabled production mail equipment and mail processing software 
orders for inserter equipment have been strong over the second half of as businesses appear to have gradually increased their capital spending in anticipation of an improving economy 
capital services revenue decreased due to our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket  structured  third party  financing of non core lease assets 
business segment operating profit the following table shows operating profit in and by business segment dollars in millions change global mailstream solutions global enterprise solutions total messaging solutions non core core capital services total operating profit total messaging solutions operating profit increased over the prior year 
operating profit increased in the global mailstream solutions segment and declined in the global enterprise solutions segment 
global mailstream solutions operating profit increased supported by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses 
operating profit was favorably impacted by foreign currency and lower interest expense 
operating profit was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the continuing weak economy and a shift to lower margin products and services 
the operating profit decrease in our global enterprise solutions segment resulted from a operating profit decrease at pbms partially offset by a operating profit increase at dmt 
operating profit at pbms was adversely impacted by acquiring new lower margin accounts  lost higher margin accounts  and contraction of businesses in the telecommunications  financial services and transaction based legal services sectors 
pbms continued its actions to offset economic sensitivity by diversifying its customer base into other market segments and providing higher value services to existing customers while reducing general and administrative expenses to address margin pressures 
dmt s operating profit growth resulted from increased placements of high margin equipment 
operating profit decreased in the capital services segment consistent with our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket  structured  third party  financing of non core lease assets 
operating profit was favorably impacted by lower interest expense compared to the prior year as a result of the decline in interest rates and the sale of non core capital services assets 
revenue by source the following table shows revenue in and by source dollars in millions change sales rentals core financing non core financing business services support services total revenue sales revenue increased over the prior year due to strong supplies sales  sales of dmt equipment and the favorable impact of foreign currency  which more than offset the impact of delayed decision making for upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our global mailstream solutions product lines 
rentals revenue increased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and the strong placements of our digital standalone meters and new digital system meters 
at december   digital meters represented approximately of our us meter base  up from in and electronic meters represented approximately of our us meter base  down from in we no longer place mechanical meters  which is in line with usps guidelines 
as previously mentioned  in  we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology 
see legal and regulatory matters 
we do not expect this transition to have a material adverse impact on rentals revenue 
core financing revenue increased due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency 
in total  we financed and of all sales in and  respectively 
non core financing revenue decreased due to our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket  structured  third party  financing of non core lease assets 
business services revenue includes revenue from pbms and psi 
pbms revenue increased due mainly to the acquisition of ddd and the favorable impact of foreign currency 
revenue growth at pbms was adversely affected by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts  especially in the telecommunications  financial services and legal sectors  which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with our long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in revenue at psi  which was acquired on august   increased business services revenue driven by the expansion of our presort network to sites at december  from sites at december  support services revenue increased due primarily to an increased service contract base and the favorable impact of foreign currency 
despite competitive pricing pressures  global mailstream solutions achieved a strong increase in support services revenue due to a larger population of equipment maintenance agreements 
dmt had growth in support services revenue driven by higher professional services revenue 
ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels 
costs of revenue the following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in and dollars in millions percentage of revenue cost of sales cost of rentals cost of core financing cost of non core financing cost of business services cost of support services cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenue  increased compared with  primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international and dmt revenue and the initial costs associated with our transition to outsourcing parts for digital equipment

research and development expenses the following table shows research and development expenses in and dollars in millions change research and development expenses increased in to million  reflecting our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products 
this increase represents expenditures for new digital meters and mailing machines  billing and statement software  distribution and logistics software  advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment 
we expect similar levels of investment in research and development in net interest expense the following table shows net interest expense in and dollars in millions change net interest expense decreased in due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings associated with our investment in leasing and rental products  acquisitions  dividends  and our stock repurchase program 
our variable and fixed rate debt mix  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps  was and  respectively  at december  based on current borrowing levels  a basis point change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately million to million 
effective tax rate the following table shows the effective tax rate in and the effective tax rate in includes a 
tax benefit from the restructuring charges recorded in the effective tax rate in included a tax benefit related to our capital services charge 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by our strategy to cease originating large ticket  structured  third party  financing of non core lease assets 
the tax rate continues to benefit from leasing and financing activities 
the tax rate is also favorably affected by our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies 
our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase as we continue to implement our non core capital services strategy outlined on page income from continuing operations increased from million to million in and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from to in in  income from continuing operations was reduced by pre tax restructuring charges of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share and pre tax contributions to charitable foundations of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share  and increased by pre tax income related to the favorable resolution of contingencies related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit that was settled in of million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share

in  income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash pre tax capital services charge of approximately million million net of taxes or cents per diluted share 
in  income from continuing operations was reduced by a charge of cents per diluted share related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology and a charge of cents per diluted share related to restructuring initiatives  and increased by a net gain of cents per diluted share from legal settlements

our new dm series of digital mailing systems featuring intellilink technology experienced good customer acceptance 
within the global mailstream solutions segment  international mailing revenue grew  of which was attributable to revenue from the acquisition of secap and the favorable impact of foreign currency 
the remaining growth was primarily attributable to improved revenue trends in the uk and canada 
this revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in germany and several other european countries  where demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment  and where we have not yet launched our new dm series 
global enterprise solutions revenue growth of over the prior year was driven by a increase at pbms primarily as a result of the acquisition of dsi 
pbms continued to improve its competitive position and generated strong growth in new written business  particularly in higher value document management services  but this growth was partially offset by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts  especially in the financial services and legal sectors

our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing portfolio is financed through investments in leveraged lease transactions  direct financing lease transactions and through our equity investment in pbg capital partners llc pbg 
risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments  our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment  and or in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio  the absence of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements 
at december  and  approximately and respectively  of our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments was further secured by approximately million and million  respectively  of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements 
capital services portfolio our investment in capital services lease related assets included in our consolidated balance sheets is composed of the following december dollars in millions leveraged leases finance receivables other assets rental equipment total our investment in leveraged lease assets consists of the following december dollars in millions rental receivables residual value principal and interest on nonrecourse loans unearned income total leveraged leases rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on independent appraisals 
we regularly review the recorded residual value to ensure it is appropriate 
principal and interest on nonrecourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
the nonrecourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property 
if a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient  we have no obligation to make any payments due on these nonrecourse loans to the unrelated third parties 
accordingly  we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the nonrecourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value 
at december  and  the principal balances on the nonrecourse loans totaled billion and billion  respectively  and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled billion and billion  respectively 
unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases 
total leveraged leases represent the amount that is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
the investment in total leveraged leases in our consolidated balance sheets is diversified across the following types of assets dollars in millions original lease term in years locomotives and rail cars postal equipment commercial aircraft commercial real estate telecommunications rail and bus shipping and handling total leveraged leases at december  and  our leveraged lease investment in commercial real estate facilities included approximately million and million  respectively  related to leases of corporate facilities to four us telecommunication entities  of which million and million  respectively  is with lessees that are highly rated

at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of this portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements 
in  as part of our capital services charges discussed on page  we increased our provision for credit losses related to our investment in the telecommunications industry 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements 
in addition  at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations which have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events 
finance receivables are composed of the following december dollars in millions assets held for sale single investor leases large ticket single investor leases imagistics lease portfolio total other assets represent our equity interest in pbg 
see off balance sheet items for a further discussion of our equity interest in pbg 
in  our net investment in pbg was reduced by a write down of aircraft lease receivables of approximately million and additional provisions for credit losses of approximately million related to aircraft lease investments in the us see capital services charges 
our consolidated statements of income includes financing revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  attributable to our assets held for sale portfolio 
off balance sheet items finance receivables sales as part of our capital services programs  we have  from time to time sold  through securitizations  net finance receivables with limited recourse 
in these transactions  we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
and received a cash payment from the transferee 
specifically  the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company 
at the time of sale  we obtained legal counsel s opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law 
under the terms of the sale  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received 
there are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor 
we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
we have accounted for these transactions as a sale  recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale 
any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale 
the maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts 
we believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation  in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
in selective cases  when we have sold net finance receivables  we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors 
the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with gaap  we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment 
these contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value  and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers 
at december  and  the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts 
as part of our review of our risk exposure  we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
equity interest during  we formed pbg with gatx corporation gatx for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets existing at that time 
we contributed assets to pbg and maintain a interest 
we currently account for our investment in pbg under the equity method and do not record the assets and liabilities of pbg in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we will be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of pbg effective march  when the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
consolidation of variable interest entities become effective for us 
see new accounting pronouncements for further details on the impact of adopting fin no 
our maximum exposure is our investment of million in our consolidated balance sheets at december  pbg s total assets and liabilities at december  are million and million  respectively 
state and local government financing as part of our capital services business  we originated tax exempt secured loans to state and local governments and sold certificates of interest in these loans 
generally  we recognized revenue for the fees we received upon the sale of these certificates 
these transactions however  may have required us to buy back certificates if interest rates rose significantly 
during  we sold all of our remaining interest in these structures 
we have no future servicing responsibility or risk associated with these transactions 
certificates outstanding at december  were million  which in accordance with gaap  were not recorded as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
restructuring charges restructuring plan in january  we announced that we would undertake restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment 
at that time  we expected the pre tax cost of these restructuring initiatives would be about million million net of taxes 
we continue to review the anticipated cost of these restructuring initiatives and currently estimate charges to continue at about the same rate as those recorded in the fourth quarter of as we continue to finalize our restructuring plans  the ultimate amount of the restructuring charges may differ from our current estimates 
the charges related to these restructuring initiatives will be recorded as the various initiatives take effect 
the restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in and beyond while enhancing growth  primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses

other exit costs related primarily to incremental costs associated with cancellation and separation of facility occupancy leases that were shared between the company and imagistics international inc igi 
this restructuring plan was substantially completed at december  meter transition in  we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology 
the information capture and exchange  made possible by advanced technology  turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems 
this two way information architecture  in turn  enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking  delivery confirmation and rate information 
the adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the us and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies 
as a result of this plan  certain electronic meter rental assets and related equipment will not be placed back in service 
in addition  certain leased equipment will either not be remarketed or will result in lower realization at the end of the lease as a result of the introduction of new technology 
in connection with this plan  we recorded non cash pre tax charges of million for the year ended december   related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to 
to at december  compared with 
to at december  the increase in this ratio was due primarily to the 
billion decrease in notes payable and current portion of long term obligations as a result of the decrease in overall debt combined with the issuances of long term debt during the year ended december  see financings and capitalization for further details 
to manage interest rate risk  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities  variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
during  we took advantage of lower interest rates in refinancing the debt in our portfolio that matured during the year 
this will better position us against a rise in interest rates in the future 
in  we received million in cash associated with the termination of four swap agreements 
as a result of these transactions  our fixed to floating percentages increased to and  respectively at december  compared to and  respectively at december  the following table summarizes our cash flows in  and dollars in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents during  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and the increase in deferred taxes on income  partially offset by a pension plan contribution  changes in working capital and increases in internal finance receivables

in  we made a year end contribution of approximately million to our us pension plan 
in  we made year end contributions of approximately million and million to our us and us pension plans  respectively 
we expect these additional investments to significantly offset the impact of changes to actuarial assumptions and loss experience 
in  we lowered the discount rate to 
in  we reduced our long term rate of return on assets assumption to  lowered the discount rate to  and adopted a new mortality table 
we expect that incremental pension costs attributable to these assumption changes  net of the impact of the pension plan contributions  will be approximately cents per diluted share 
the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was at december   versus at december  including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt  the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by a net reduction of total debt  favorable foreign currency translation adjustments and income offset by the million repurchase of million shares of common stock 
financings and capitalization at december   million remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in october with the securities and exchange commission sec  permitting issuances of up to billion in debt securities  preferred stock and depositary shares 
in april  as part of this shelf registration statement  we established a medium term note program for the issuance of up to billion in aggregate principal  representing the remaining amount available on the shelf at that time 
at december   we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of billion in the us and million outside the us  primarily to support commercial paper issuance

this note was recorded as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
the proceeds from this transaction were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock

in september  we sold our remaining interest in the lease transaction and transferred the obligation on the remaining nonrecourse promissory note with a total principal balance of approximately million 
the transfer of this obligation was reflected as a reduction of long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets

these unsecured notes bear annual interest at and mature in may the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  the financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock 
we believe our financing needs for the next months can be met with cash generated internally  money from existing credit agreements  debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other noncurrent liabilities of million included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million of rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in these additions included expenditures for plant and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure improvements as well as increased investments associated with new accounts at pbms 
the additions of rental equipment primarily were postage meters 
the increase in our capital expenditures over the prior year was driven by our continued investments in infrastructure improvements  digital equipment for pbms sites and new digital postage meters 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately the same as these investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters 
at december   commitments for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs reflected the items discussed above 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to customer cancellations  bad debts  inventories  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition multiple element arrangements we derive our revenue from the following sources sales  rentals  core financing  non core financing  business services  and support services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the usual form of these transactions involves the sale or lease of equipment  a cancelable meter rental and or a cancelable equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in these cases  revenue is recognized for each of the elements based on their respective fair values 
fair values of any meter rental or equipment maintenance agreement are determined by reference to the prices charged in standalone or renewal transactions 
fair value of the equipment is determined based upon negotiated selling prices 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
internal financing arrangements we provide lease financing of our products in the us and outside the us primarily through sales type leases 
when a sales type lease is consummated  we record the gross finance receivable  unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment 
residual values are estimated based upon the average expected proceeds to be received at the end of the lease term 
management evaluates recorded residual values on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
a reduction in estimated residual values could require an impairment charge as well as a reduction in future financing income 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
based on historical experience  we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables through the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
our financial services businesses base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
in addition  in our capital services programs  we have considered collateral values 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
in our capital services programs  we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms  such as in the event of bankruptcy 
otherwise  we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over days past due or as circumstances warrant 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to make the following assessments we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts 
long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally three to years and buildings up to years 
we depreciate rental equipment using the straight line method over appropriate periods  which is principally three to ten years 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to ten years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives  which are principally five to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at december  and however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
however  recent regulations were issued in november  and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology 
significant negative economic or industry trends 
changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets 
significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital 
future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail 
future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
retirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions 
we make assumptions relating to discount rates  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets  health care cost trends and other factors 
we base our discount rate assumption on current yields on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and future outlook 
our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and future expectations of rates of return 
our health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely future trends 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and could therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods

usps information based indicia program ibip in may  the usps publicly announced its concept of its ibip for future postage evidencing devices 
as initially stated by the usps  the purpose of the program was to develop a new standard for future digital postage evidencing devices which would significantly enhance postal revenue security and support expanded usps value added services to mailers 
the program would consist of the development of four separate specifications i the indicium specification  ii a postal security device specification  iii a host specification  and iv a vendor infrastructure specification 
during the period from may through december   we submitted extensive comments to a series of proposed ibip specifications issued by the usps  including comments on the ibi performance criteria 
other regulatory matters in december  we received accepted closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs showing income tax adjustments for the to tax years 
the total additional tax for these years is approximately million 
additional tax due for and future tax years in connection with these closing agreements will not materially affect our future results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in addition to the accepted income tax adjustments  one proposed adjustment remains in dispute  which could result in additional tax of approximately million 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to this deficiency and that the ultimate outcome will not result in a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years 
however  if the irs prevails on this deficiency  additional tax may be due for and future tax years  which could materially affect our future results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  to an extent  price increases 
although not affecting income  deferred translation gains of million were recorded in resulting from the stronger british pound  canadian dollar and euro as compared to the us dollar 
deferred translation gains of million were recorded in resulting from the stronger british pound and euro as compared to the us dollar 
deferred translation losses of million were recorded in resulting principally from the weaker canadian dollar  british pound and euro currencies as compared to the us dollar 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
at december   we had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  all maturing in  to buy or sell various currencies 
risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values  interest and or exchange rates 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividend policy our board of directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors

our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
