item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating strategy we operate two national distribution networks the scp distributors network scp and the superior pool products spp network 
the scp network consists of service centers and the spp network consists of locations 
we adopted this strategy of operating two distinct national distribution networks primarily for two reasons to offer our customers a choice of different distributors featuring distinctive product selections and relationships with manufacturers  and to increase the level of customer service provided by the service centers in each network by promoting a healthy competition between the two networks 
products we offer more than  national brand and private label products 
we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies  chemicals  replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the swimming pool industry 
the products we sell can be categorized as follows maintenance products such as chemicals  supplies and pool accessories  repair and replacement parts for cleaners  filters  heaters  pumps and lights  packaged pool kits including walls  liners  bracing  filters  heaters  pumps and lights for in ground and above ground pools  and pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools 
maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are non discretionary in nature  meaning that these items must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools 
these products  together with replacement equipment  account for approximately of our net sales 
additionally  since  we have increased the breadth of complementary products we offer  including building materials  electrical supplies  toys and games  water and light features  spas and spa accessories  billiard tables  patio furniture and artificial christmas trees 
scp pool corporation part i 
item business customers and marketing we serve nearly  customers  none of which account for more than of our sales 
we primarily serve three types of customers swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores  and swimming pool repair and service companies 
we conduct our operations through service centers in north america and europe 
our primary markets are california  florida  texas and arizona  representing approximately of our net sales 
we employ a sales force dedicated to developing and strengthening our customers businesses 
as of february   a sales force of business development representatives and service center managers conduct our principal selling activities 
as discussed above  our primary marketing activities aim to raise the profile of the swimming pool industry and educate consumers on the ease of maintenance and affordability of a swimming pool 
employees we employed approximately  people at february  distribution our service centers are located near customer concentrations  typically in industrial  commercial or mixed use zones 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
our service centers maintain well stocked inventories to meet customers immediate needs 
we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving  inventory control  picking  packing and shipping functions 
in addition  we operate four centralized shipping locations that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers 
purchasing and suppliers we initiated a preferred vendor program in which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors 
our service centers are also encouraged to ensure accurate pricing and greater discipline at the point of sale 
these practices have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 
we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers  who generally offer competitive pricing  return policies and promotional allowances 
it is customary in the swimming pool supply industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool 
these terms are typically available to us for pre season or early season purchases 
scp pool corporation part i 
item business we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost  service and quality standards 
our largest suppliers include pentair corporation  hayward pool products  inc and bio lab  inc a subsidiary of great lakes chemicals  inc  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the cost of products we sold in competition we are the leading wholesale distributor in the swimming pool supply industry 
we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply distributors retailers 
some geographic markets we serve  particularly our largest  higher density markets in florida  california  texas and arizona  are more competitive than others 
barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply industry are relatively low 
we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brand name products 
if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights  we might be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool supply distribution are the breadth and availability of products offered  the quality and level of customer service  the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs  competitive product pricing  and  consistency and stability of business relationships with customers 
we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
seasonality and weather see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
environmental  health and safety regulations our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal  state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including the emergency planning and community right to know act and other environmental protection agency regulations  the hazardous materials transportation act and other department of transportation regulations  and the occupational safety and health act osha 
scp pool corporation part i 
item business most of these requirements govern the packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals 
we store chemicals at each of our service centers 
the storage of these chemicals is strictly regulated by local fire codes 
in addition  we sell algaecides that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and state pesticide laws 
these laws primarily relate to labeling and annual registration 
while we make considerable efforts to ensure that we operate in substantial compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements  we cannot assure you that we will not be determined to be out of compliance with  or liable under  such requirements 
such an instance of noncompliance or liability could be harmful to our operating results 
intellectual property we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products and we intend to maintain the trademark registrations important to our business operations 
we also own rights to several internet domain names 
item properties we lease the pool administrative headquarters  which consist of approximately  square feet of an office building in covington  louisiana 
we own three service centers in florida 
all of our other properties are leased for terms that expire between and in addition to minimum rental payments  which are set at competitive rates  certain leases require reimbursement for taxes  maintenance and insurance 
most of our leases contain renewal options  some of which involve rent increases 
our service centers range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet and consist of warehouse  counter  display and office space 
our centralized shipping locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained  suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs 
as part of our normal business  we regularly evaluate service center performance and may relocate a service center or consolidate two locations if a service center is redundant in a market  under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable 
we do not believe that any single lease is material to our operations and alternate sites are presently available at market rates

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with net sales of billion in  we are the world s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies and related equipment 
we purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores and swimming pool repair and service companies 
we distribute more than  products through service centers in the united states and six foreign countries 
approximately of our net sales are domestic 
we operate two networks the scp distributors network scp  which consists of locations and the superior pool products spp network  which consists of locations 
we adopted this strategy to offer our customers a choice of different distributors  each featuring distinctive product selections and supplier relationships  and to encourage continued improvements in customer service through healthy competition between the two networks 
as part of the distribution businesses  we have acquired three small manufacturing facilities located in fort wayne  indiana  bordeaux  france and quebec  canada  which engage in the manufacturing of packaged pool panels  steps  liners and coping 
approximately of our consolidated cost of sales consisted of items we manufactured at these facilities and sold through our distribution networks  which has contributed to higher gross margins and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
our manufacturing sales to third parties accounted for approximately of our net sales in we invest significant resources to promote the growth of the swimming pool industry 
our marketing philosophy incorporates a focus on increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of pool ownership and the affordability and ease of maintaining a pool 
our www 
backyardescape 
com and www 
poolpronetwork 
com websites are tools we use to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers 
weather is the biggest challenge we face 
in the first half of  extended cool temperatures in the northern united states and significant rainfall in the eastern portion of the country adversely affected sales in our industry 
these adverse weather conditions were partially mitigated by warm  dry weather experienced in the western united states along with reasonable weather in the late summer months  providing solid sales growth in the second half of our business is subject to significant risks  including weather  competition  general economic conditions and other risks detailed below in our cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we sell everything necessary to build  maintain  install and overhaul residential and small commercial swimming pools  including swimming pool equipment  parts and supplies  chemicals  cleaners  packaged pools  liners  filters  heaters  pumps  lights  repair parts  and other equipment 
since  we have increased the breadth of complementary products we offer including building materials  electrical supplies  toys and games  water features such as fountains  spas and spa accessories 
billiard tables  and artificial christmas trees 
we primarily sell to swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores  and swimming pool repair and service companies 
these customers are mostly small  family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain a strict credit policy 
in the past  losses from customer receivables have been within our expectations 
our expenses consist primarily of i the cost of products purchased for resale and ii operating expenses primarily related to labor  occupancy  freight  marketing  selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
such measures adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began calculating our base business growth 
to assist in the transition from the discussion of same store growth to base business growth  in we provided both figures 
going forward  we will no longer provide a discussion of same store growth  but rather we will focus on the growth of our base business  which is more consistent with measures used by other distributors 
we calculate base business growth by excluding the following service centers from the calculation for months new service centers acquired within the past months  service centers consolidated with acquired service centers  and new service centers opened in new markets in the past months 
we calculate same store growth by excluding the following service centers from the calculation for months new service centers opened within the past months  service centers acquired within the past months  service centers consolidated with acquired service centers  and service centers that experience market disruption due to their location in the immediate market areas of those mentioned above 
the base business calculation differs slightly from the same store calculation because base business includes i new service centers opened in existing markets and ii service centers affected due to their location in the immediate market areas of newly opened or acquired locations 
additionally  we allocate overhead expenses to the base business by considering base business net sales as a percentage of total net sales 
the swimming pool industry we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young  with room for tremendous growth 
of the approximately million households in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool  approximately own a pool 
the industry has grown at a to annual rate for the past years 
we believe the swimming pool industry will continue to grow at a rate of approximately to annually over the next five years  primarily because of the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools and secondarily because of new pool installations 
the greater part of revenues in our industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools and the repair and replacement of the equipment that maintains those pools 
thus  the industry has generally not been negatively affected by economic downturns  although there is no assurance that this will continue 
the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation  entertainment  family activity  exercise  convenience and landscaping 
the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling  boats  motorcycles  recreational vehicles and vacations 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the business in our industry is seasonal  and weather is the biggest challenge 
the industry is also affected by other factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels  the rate of new housing construction and consumer attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following six accounting policies that require us to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses if our customers do not make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from our customers within days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers 
the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april  may and june or may and june  depending on geographical location 
in the past  credit losses have been within our expectations 
as our business is seasonal  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months  and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from for amounts currently due up to for specific accounts more than days past due 
at the end of each year  we perform a specific reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than  additionally  we perform a general reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging 
as we review these past due accounts  we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
during the year  we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
such write offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past five years  write offs have averaged less than of net sales 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  inventory obsolescence and shrink reserve product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet 
our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers 
to do this  we maintain at each service center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory  which are not as critical to our customers and thus  inherently have lower velocity 
service centers classify products into classes based on sales at that location over the past months 
the table below presents a description of these inventory classes classes fastest moving items  which represent approximately of net sales at the service center classes slower moving items  which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class products with no sales at a particular service center for the past twelve months or special order products not yet delivered to the customer there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes because products in these classes turn quickly 
we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes  which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence  with particular emphasis on skus with the weakest sales over the previous months 
the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit 
we provide a general reserve of for inventory in classes we also provide an additional reserve for excess inventory in classes and an additional for excess class inventory 
we define excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous months usage on a company wide basis 
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrink at the service center level  we consider a combination of factors including the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales level by product  including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels  changes in customer preferences  the experience of the service center manager  the previous inventory management performance of the service center  geographical location  and new product offerings 
our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the above identified factors 
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and the appropriate amendments 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue when customers take delivery of products 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
we may offer volume rebates  which we accrue monthly as an adjustment to net sales 
we record customer returns  including those associated with early buy programs  as an adjustment to net sales 
in the past  customer returns have not been material 
vendor rebates we account for vendor rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of consideration  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures  generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors 
we account for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product  at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of the rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the rebates 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to product already purchased  it may lower or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we record deferred tax assets to the extent we believe there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior to their expiration 
due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
we must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currently recorded 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december   united states taxes were not provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states  or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  additional tax provisions may be required 
due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of income taxes that would have to be provided for in such a case  if any 
we have operations in states and six foreign countries  and we are subject to tax audit in each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at december   our net goodwill balance was million  representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these rules  we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
in october  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which requires comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value  including goodwill 
as a result of this test  we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not impaired 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal  and weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions weather possible effects hot and dry increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools increased purchases of above ground pools unseasonably cool weather or fewer pool installations extraordinary amounts of rain decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies decreased purchases of impulse items such as above ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends a longer pool season  thus increasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us unseasonably late warming trends a shorter pool season  thus decreasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us for example  in the first half of the eastern united states experienced significantly higher rainfall  which adversely impacted new pool construction 
extended cool and mild temperatures in the northern half of the united states delayed the use of pools and adversely impacted the sale of swimming pool maintenance and supply items 
these adverse weather conditions were partially mitigated by the warm and dry weather in the western portion of the country 
reasonable weather in the late summer months provided for solid sales growth in the second half of in general  sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses 
in  approximately of net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  and approximately of operating income was generated in that same period 
we typically experience a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season 
excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases  our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter  primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired service centers 
we attempt to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for and in our opinion  this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry  the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  the timing and extent of share repurchases  and capital expenditures 
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings 
in the past  borrowings and cash from operations have been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions

the current eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to 
substantially all of our assets  including capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has numerous restrictive covenants  which require that we maintain a minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage and which also restrict our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements 
in the first quarter of  we closed an accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility with a peak seasonal borrowing capacity of up to million 
the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
this subsidiary sells an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit 
we account for the receivables facility on balance sheet because we have maintained effective control of the receivables 
accordingly  the receivables and the related debt are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we employed this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing 
at december   there was million outstanding under the receivables facility  which represented the maximum available for borrowing at that date 
the average effective interest rate of the receivables facility was approximately for the year ended december  the receivables facility expires in march  and we intend to replace the receivables facility with a new facility at such time 
at december   our contractual obligations of long term debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual less than years and obligations total year years years thereafter long term debt     short term financing   operating leases      scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in this increase is due to an increase in net income and improved working capital management 
we continue to better manage our inventory  and generally improved discipline on working capital 
we anticipate cash flow from operations to approximate net income in excluding the effects of acquisitions  if any  we do not expect our cash used in investing activities to change materially in in  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million from million in  primarily due to the decrease in product inventories  partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable 
initially  acquisitions are financed through increased bank borrowings  and those borrowings are then reduced with cash flows from operations 
the same principle applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  acquisitions in represented million of the balance at december   and accounts receivable grew by  net of acquisitions 
this increase is consistent with the increase in base business net sales between years 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased to million at december  from million at december  the allowance represented of the accounts receivable greater than days past due in december compared to in december product inventories and the reserve for shrink and obsolescence product inventories increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  inventory at locations acquired during was approximately million at december at december   the inventory reserve of million was unchanged from the prior year 
the slowest moving class of inventory decreased approximately million from to share repurchase program as part of our share repurchase program  in we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of per share 
we subsequently canceled these shares 
the impact of our common stock repurchases had the effect of reducing diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately million shares for the year ended december  scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on february th and th   we purchased  shares at an average price of 
on february   million remained available under the authorization of our board of directors for future share repurchases 
we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases  or we may incur additional debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our long term debt 
to mitigate this risk  in may we entered into an interest swap agreement with variable notional amounts 
the swap became effective september  and expires may  if i the variable rates on our revolving credit facility increased or decreased from the rate at december   and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility million and the receivables facility million for all of  then our pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  the fair value of our revolving credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates 
foreign exchange risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada  mexico  the united kingdom  france  portugal and spain 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the size of our foreign operations  however  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in functional currencies canada canadian dollar mexico peso united kingdom british pound france eurodollar portugal eurodollar spain eurodollar scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our forward looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events  including projections of future performance  statements of management s plans and objectives  future contracts  and forecasts of trends and other matters 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  believe  will likely result  outlook  project and other words and expressions of similar meaning 
no assurance can be given that the results in any forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors  which could cause them to differ materially 
for these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 
certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements include the following weather 
weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
for example  unseasonably late warming trends can decrease the length of the pool season and unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use  installation and maintenance 
seasonality 
our business is highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use  installation  remodeling and repair  and of our operating income was generated in the same period 
our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year  when we may incur net losses 
competition 
we face competition from both outside our industry with sellers of other leisure product alternatives  such as boats and motor homes  and from within our industry with various regional and local distributors  several companies that distribute swimming pool supplies on a national basis and  to a lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers 
new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry 
our largest geographic markets that we service  such as california  texas and florida  also tend to be more competitive than others 
general economic conditions 
our industry is somewhat dependent upon overall economic and market conditions 
for example  in economic downturns  the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending  new housing construction and swimming pool construction decline 
environmental  health  transportation and safety regulation 
we are subject to regulation under federal  state and local environmental  health  transportation and safety requirements  which govern such things as packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals and other products 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief 
moreover  compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts 
these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 
the clear trend in environmental  health  transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment  such as the use and handling of chemical substances  and protect the health and safety of individuals 
increasingly  strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other businesses throughout the united states  and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
fire  safety and casualty 
we store chemicals at our service centers and central stocking locations  including certain combustible  oxidizing compounds 
a fire  explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire  safety and casualty losses and related liability claims 
growth 
we have experienced substantial growth in recent years through acquisitions and the opening of new locations that have increased our size  scope and geographic distribution 
while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion  no assurance can be made as to our ability to penetrate new markets  identify appropriate acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate scp pool corporation cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of continued acquired businesses  obtain financing  generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities  maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  and identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 
international operations 
during  international sales accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
we anticipate that future international sales will increase and may account for a more significant percentage of our sales 
risks associated with our international operations include political and economic instability  export controls  foreign government tax policies and regulatory requirements  united states and foreign government policy changes  convertibility and transferability of international currencies  and restrictions on the movement of funds or goods 
key personnel 
out future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
supplier relationships 
we presently purchase product from over  manufacturers 
our inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
marketing 
our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising  marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened national economy and an increasingly competitive marketplace in which we also compete with other luxury product alternatives  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in public and consumer tastes could also have an effect on our business 
laws and regulations 
changes in laws and regulations  including i healthcare reform initiatives in the united states at the state and federal level and in other countries  ii tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations in the united states and certain foreign countries  and iii changes in accounting standards  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other factors 
other factors that may impact our business include acts of war or terrorist incidents  future litigation  governmental proceedings  and labor relations and disputes 
the foregoing factors are not exhaustive and new factors may emerge which impact our business 
it is impossible for us to predict all such factors 
therefore  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 
we cannot guarantee that any future event or result will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
should additional risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements
