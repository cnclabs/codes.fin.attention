item business 
general we are a supermarket retailer and grocery wholesaler principally through corporate owned  franchised and independent supermarkets 
at the end of  we owned and operated supermarkets  a gas station  a convenience store and franchised an additional supermarkets 
our corporate and franchised supermarkets are sometimes collectively referred to in this form k as our supermarkets 
twenty of our corporate supermarkets operate under the piggly wiggly banner and eight of them operate under the dick s supermarkets banner 
all of our franchised supermarkets operate under the piggly wiggly banner 
we are the primary supplier to all supermarkets and also serve as a wholesaler to a number of smaller  independently operated supermarkets and convenience stores 
all of our supermarkets and other wholesale customers are located in wisconsin  northern illinois and eastern iowa 
strategic plan in  we adopted a strategic plan which included a goal of trying to achieve a compound annual growth rate in revenue for the five years beginning in to achieve this goal  we would have had to acquire several multiple store supermarket chains 
in june  we completed the acquisition of dick s supermarkets  inc  our first multiple store supermarket chain acquisition 
in  our revenue increased by largely as a result of this acquisition and we achieved our revenue growth goal 
however  due to the difficult economic climate  intense competition in our markets and the length of time since our most recent successful acquisition  our revenue increased by only and in and  respectively  and we did not meet our revenue growth goal in either or as a result of these factors and our recent financial results  during the last half of our board of directors took action to terminate our chief financial officer and vice president retail operations and reached an agreement with our chief executive officer regarding the termination of our relationship with him 
in december  we hired a new executive vice president operations  louis e 
stinebaugh  and re hired our retired long time chief financial officer  john h 
dahly 
with the input of our new management team  our board of directors decided that we needed to change our operational focus by intensifying our efforts on improving the results of our current operations  reducing our debt and reinvigorating our franchise system  rather than trying to grow our business through additional multiple store supermarket acquisitions 
as a result  we intend to focus more on our wholesale operations while also improving the operating results of our corporate retail stores 
actions our activities in included expanding the square footage at our cross plains  mayville and mosinee  wisconsin franchised supermarkets in july  july and december   respectively  closing older franchised supermarkets and replacing them with new  larger and more competitive supermarkets in juneau  omro and union grove  wisconsin in february  july and november   respectively  opening a replacement corporate supermarket in sheboygan  wisconsin in august that includes a combined convenience store and pig stop r gas station  opening a new market corporate supermarket in kenosha  wisconsin in january  acquiring and remodeling a new market corporate supermarket in racine  wisconsin from one of our competitors that opened in september  acquiring a new  larger and more competitive corporate supermarket in menasha  wisconsin from one of our competitors in september  and closing our corporate supermarket in watertown  wisconsin in december planned activities in  we will replace our existing bakery deli production facility in platteville  wisconsin with a new  substantially larger facility also in platteville 
we believe that this new facility will allow us to substantially increase our sale of bakery and deli products to our franchisees and independent customers  including potentially adding new independent customers that could not be served from our existing facility 
we also opened one new market corporate supermarket in january and plan to replace one franchised supermarket with a new  larger and more competitive supermarket in due to our new operational focus that places a greater emphasis on improving the results of our current operations through a new focus on our in store value proposition  emphasizing our wholesale business and reducing our debt  we do not anticipate purchasing or building additional new corporate supermarkets in finally  as discussed in greater detail in section titled item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of and our new operational focus below  we plan to close five corporate supermarkets and one franchised supermarket in retail operations our supermarkets stock a comprehensive selection of groceries  frozen foods  prepared foods  fresh produce  meat  poultry  eggs and dairy products as well as non food items  such as health and beauty aids  housewares  magazines and periodicals  video cassette rentals  flowers and plants  greeting cards and general merchandise 
similarly  to appeal to value conscious consumers  our supermarkets have areas in which all items are or less 
our supermarkets also have areas dedicated to addressing emerging consumer purchasing preferences  including naturally good and good for you sections that stock organic and other items that appeal to health conscious consumers 
we believe that these initiatives have helped us appeal to consumers who would otherwise choose to purchase items in these sections from specialty health based or dollar stores 
see our supermarkets below for more information 
the products in our supermarkets fall within a broad range of branded merchandise and private label store branded product alternatives 
in general  the private label products have lower selling prices  but higher gross profit margins  than branded merchandise 
consistent with trends generally within the retail supermarket industry  we continue to experience increases in customer demand for store brands and believe that our topco procured line of branded products is satisfying this consumer trend 
see purchasing and distribution below for more information 
based on our internal wholesale price index  inflation did not have a significant effect on sales between and we operate two customer incentive card programs  the piggly wiggly preferred club card and the dick s savings club card 
we designed our customer card programs to reward current customers and attract new customers by offering clipless coupons on advertised specials  automatic savings on store specials and point of sale coupons redeemable on future purchases 
the cards also double as check cashing and video rental identification cards 
the cards allow us to maintain a valuable  integrated database that we use to identify our best customers and their preferences so that our supermarkets can better serve them 
our preferred power pricing program targets items that shoppers have traditionally purchased from supermarkets  but for which there has been a trend toward purchasing these items in large quantities from alternative sources such as warehouse club stores  supercenters  department stores or pet stores 
under our preferred power pricing program  we feature aggressive month long sales promotions on large or mega sizes of selected items and offer prices below those associated with weekly supermarket sales 
specific examples of product categories that we have featured in our preferred power pricing program include paper products such as toilet paper  napkins and paper towels  laundry supplies  pet supplies  coffee  cereal and certain perishable items 
we believe that many customers choose their supermarket based on the attributes of the produce department 
our pampered to perfection program is a comprehensive program designed to ensure that our supermarkets provide our customers with the highest quality produce possible 
as a part of this program  we have thoroughly analyzed our entire process of handling fresh merchandise and created several special warehouse storage environments to assure the proper handling of produce 
in addition  we are working with our suppliers to ensure that they share the high standards that we have established 
this ensures the pampered to perfection program sets rigorous standards for fresh produce from the time it is grown to the time it is taken home by customers 
finally  we designed a comprehensive educational program for all of our supermarket produce managers to ensure that they are able to implement the store level aspects of our pampered to perfection program  including our rigorous point produce department inspection and certification 
our preferred power pricing and pampered to perfection programs have increased average customer transaction totals  contributed to same store sales increases and reversed sales erosion and built incremental sales in key product categories 
we also operate a convenience store and a gas station located adjacent to one of our supermarkets 
we believe that these facilities provide an opportunity for us to increase net sales through sales of gas and by capturing additional sales to customers who prefer the ease of shopping at a convenience store 
although sales at these facilities accounted for less than of our net sales  we are evaluating the feasibility of adding gas stations and convenience stores at several of our other supermarkets 
wholesale operations we are the primary supplier to all of our supermarkets 
we also serve as a wholesaler to other smaller independent retail supermarkets  although such sales accounted for less than of our net sales 
in addition  in  we served as a temporary secondary wholesale supplier to a group of local supermarkets that were supplied by a competitor of ours that had filed for bankruptcy 
this arrangement  which ended in august  accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we supply a variety of products to our supermarkets and other wholesale customers  primarily from our two distribution centers in sheboygan  wisconsin 
in addition  we provide our supermarkets and other customers with bakery and deli items from our centralized bakery deli production facility in platteville  wisconsin and fresh  frozen and processed meat  eggs and deli products from a third party distribution facility in milwaukee  wisconsin 
additionally  through arrangements with several vendors  we also offer a line of carbonated soft drinks  fruit drinks and drinking and distilled water under our springtime label 
a key part of our wholesale operations is the strong partnership between us and our franchised supermarkets established by our fresh brands program 
this partnership  which results in an integrated retail food distribution system that had over million in retail sales in  allows us to leverage the combined buying power of all of our franchised and corporate supermarkets and deliver a powerful and effective promotional vehicle for our participating vendor partners 
by operating in this manner  we are able to achieve better performance than if we did not coordinate the promotions run by our franchisee customers 
our franchisees  most of which own only one or two supermarkets  benefit from our fresh brands program because it provides them with cost effective administrative support services and financial resources that are associated with being a part of a large organization and are difficult for independent operators to replicate or obtain on their own 
we believe that our fresh brands program provides our franchisees with the support services and financial resources they need to operate efficient  contemporary supermarkets that can compete with supermarkets owned and operated by competitors with substantially greater resources  while retaining the independent retail ownership  entrepreneurial spirit and community involvement that we believe is an integral part of the success of many of our franchisees 
among the services that we provide to our franchisees are retail performance counseling and supervision  retail financial accounting  preparation of supermarket payrolls  preparation of print  electronic and outdoor media advertising including various point of sale materials  assistance in the selection and analysis of supermarket locations  financing and assistance with lease negotiations  merchandise planning  equipment selection and sourcing  engineering services  including supermarket design  floor layout and facility project management  retail technology implementation and support  labor planning and scheduling  and product category supervision 
consistent with industry practice  in certain situations  we also provide credit enhancements to certain qualified franchisees  including by leasing the franchisee s supermarket premises and  in turn  subleasing the premises to the franchisee 
we provide some of these services as part of the fresh brands program  while other services are provided under a separate fee arrangement intended to cover our costs 
in addition  our franchisees pay us fees determined by the retail sales of their supermarkets 
we do not charge an initial fee to franchisees for granting a franchise 
another goal of our fresh brands program is to present all of the supermarkets with a common banner as operating under a unified program so that our customers can treat all such supermarkets as a part of the same supermarket chain 
we do this by coordinating systemwide promotions and other merchandising events in which all of our franchised and corporate supermarkets participate 
for example  we control the selection of sale items at all of our supermarkets and produce and distribute weekly newspaper advertising inserts that advertise the same sales at all of the supermarkets operated under the same banner 
in addition  we establish various promotions that reward our customers for aggregate amounts of selected items purchased over a period of several weeks 
these programs do not differentiate between purchases from our franchised or corporate supermarkets 
other efforts that we undertake to present all of our supermarkets that operate under the same banner as part of a single chain include outdoor billboard advertising  television and radio advertising  and sponsorship of sports entertainment and charitable events  including the midwest s largest fireworks display at milwaukee s summerfest lakefront music festival 
we are a franchisee of the piggly wiggly brand name 
under our franchise agreement  our franchise territory includes all of wisconsin  the upper peninsula of michigan and designated counties in northern illinois  southeastern minnesota and eastern iowa 
our franchise rights are of unlimited duration and are not subject to any specific termination provision 
we are required to pay franchise fees to the current franchisor in parts of our market areas 
the only other material obligation imposed on us in our franchise territory is that the supermarkets operated under the piggly wiggly name must comply with the standards imposed on supermarkets in the piggly wiggly system 
we believe that our own supermarket standards exceed the piggly wiggly system standards 
we own the dick s supermarket brand name 
our supermarkets our franchised supermarkets range in size from  square feet to  square feet  with an average of  square feet and our corporate supermarkets range in size from  square feet to  square feet  with an average of  square feet 
all of our supermarkets contain several perishable or specialty service departments  including fresh and processed meat  take home entrees and snacks  fresh fruits and vegetables  fresh seafood  delicatessen  flowers and plants  and baked goods 
several supermarkets also contain or provide one or more of the following wine and spirit sales  video rentals  lottery sales  photo processing services  ticketmaster ticket centers  in house banking services  and automated teller machines 
certain franchised and corporate supermarkets continue to fail to meet our financial performance goals and we continue to evaluate various business alternatives relating to these supermarkets in order to improve results of operations 
potential alternatives we consider include the sale or conversion of these supermarkets  closing supermarkets and implementing other operational changes 
the following table shows our development of  and changes in  our franchised and corporate retail supermarkets for the periods presented franchised supermarkets corporate supermarkets beginning of year new market supermarkets a replacement supermarkets b converted to from franchise c purchased supermarkets d terminated operations e new franchises f end of year remodeled and or expanded supermarkets g a new market supermarkets are newly constructed supermarkets in market areas not recently served by us 
b replacement supermarkets are newly constructed or purchased supermarkets whose opening corresponds with the closure of a nearby franchised or corporate supermarket 
c supermarkets that are converted from corporate to franchise units  or vice versa  are included as reductions to supermarket totals in one category and corresponding additions to totals in the other category 
d purchased supermarkets are those that we purchased from a party other than one of our franchisees 
e terminated operations represent supermarkets that are no longer going concerns  including replaced supermarkets 
f new franchises are additions to our franchise group other than through conversion from corporate supermarkets 
g remodeled supermarkets represent supermarkets that have undergone substantial expansion and or remodeling totaling at least  purchasing and distribution we purchase groceries in sufficient volume to qualify for favorable price brackets for most items 
we purchase brand name grocery merchandise directly from the manufacturers or processors and purchase produce  meat and seafood from a variety of sources 
we purchase substantially all of our private label items and fresh meats through topco associates llc 
topco is a national purchasing cooperative whose member owners consist of regional supermarket chains and food services organizations who collectively operate more than  supermarkets 
according to topco data  its member owners accounted for approximately of united states grocery store sales volume in in  purchases through topco accounted for nearly of our total wholesale and retail inventory purchases 
we also purchase supermarket and warehouse equipment and supplies  primarily bags and packaging material  through topco 
topco s size and purchasing power enable it to employ large volume  low cost purchasing techniques on behalf of its member owners 
we also participate in topco s world brands program 
world brands is a topco division dedicated to using the combined purchasing power and marketing strength of its members to obtain favorable treatment from national brand manufacturers 
to attain this goal  world brands  together with its members  negotiates with each vendor for the benefit of all of its members in a manner similar to the way that a retailer would do on behalf of its entire organization 
there are currently participants in the world brands program  each of which is a member of topco 
according to world brands data  the combined retail sales of its members surpasses that of all but three of the grocery retailers in the united states 
we believe that world brands presents us with an opportunity to qualify for more favorable prices and promotions than we could attain on our own 
we and our direct contract  third party distribution center supplied most of the products supplied to our supermarkets in the remainder of products sold by our supermarkets were supplied by direct store delivery vendors 
we operate two distribution centers in sheboygan  wisconsin with a total of approximately  square feet 
we supply deli and bakery products from our  square foot centralized bakery deli production facility located in platteville  wisconsin 
while we perform the buying function  a third party contractor in milwaukee  wisconsin performs the distribution services for our meat and dairy operations 
we believe that this arrangement provides us with operating cost efficiencies and the ability to expand our wholesale product offerings and better satisfy wholesale customer delivery schedules through improved capacity 
we operate a leased  full service trucking fleet  which consists of tractors and refrigerated trailers 
we augment our transportation requirements with temporary leasing arrangements as conditions warrant 
pw trucking  inc  our subsidiary  provides contract and common carrier services throughout our operating territory 
revenues from unrelated parties generated by this business were nominal in and are expected to be nominal in competition the wholesale and retail food industry is highly competitive 
at the wholesale level  we compete with regional and national wholesalers  such as supervalu inc  roundy s  inc 
and nash finch co 
we believe that key competitive factors include the provision of the following services to franchised customers credit enhancements and working capital support  advertising  retail performance and supervision counseling  accounting and financial services  merchandising  facilities engineering  design and project management  and retail technology support 
we believe that our distribution and production facilities and the wide range of support and marketing services provided to our supermarkets including pursuant to the fresh brands program allow us to provide prompt and efficient  low priced  high quality products and important supplemental services to our supermarkets and other customers 
the degree of competition at the retail level varies with supermarket location 
most of our supermarkets compete primarily with local retail operators  virtually all of whom are affiliated with competing wholesalers through arrangements similar to those we have with our franchisees 
in some of our supermarket locations  however  we also compete with national and regional retail chain supermarkets  including pick n save  cub foods  jewel food stores  sentry food stores  dominick s finer foods  festival foods  woodman s stores and copps supermarkets 
other competitors include the general merchandise  wholesale club and supercenter format stores  including wal mart supercenters  big kmart stores  supertarget stores and shopko stores and limited assortment grocery stores  including aldi and sav a lot stores 
we believe that the principal retail competitive factors include product quality and variety  the quality of a supermarket s perishable product and service departments  price  and supermarket location and appearance 
we believe our supermarkets emphasis on low cost  high quality products  community based multi media marketing and merchandising programs and a high degree of in store customer service and friendliness provide our franchised and corporate supermarkets with a competitive advantage in many retail market areas 
certain of our competitors at both the wholesale and retail level may have a competitive advantage resulting from utilizing lower cost  non union workforces 
certain of our competitors have greater financial resources and marketing budgets than we do 
also  certain competitors using the limited assortment grocery store format  general merchandise format  wholesale club format or supercenter format may choose to carry and market a less extensive variety of products  which may allow them to sell such items at a lower per unit cost than we do 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  persons  including approximately  in the operation of our corporate retail supermarkets 
a majority of our corporate retail supermarket employees are employed on a part time basis 
of our remaining employees  approximately work at our centralized bakery deli production facility  approximately are engaged in warehousing and or trucking activities and approximately are corporate and administrative personnel 
five of our collective bargaining agreements have already expired are being mutually extended on a meeting to meeting basis and an additional five will expire later in together these collective bargaining agreements cover approximately of our employees 
we cannot currently predict whether any strikes  work stoppages or slowdowns will be incurred in connection with renewing such agreements

risks and uncertainties as noted above in part i special note regarding forward looking statements  this annual report contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of risks and uncertainties such as those listed below  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook 
we face credit risks associated with our franchisees operations 
consistent with industry practice  in certain situations  we provide credit enhancements to certain franchisees  including by leasing the franchisee s supermarket premises and  in turn  subleasing the premises to the franchisee 
in addition  we have guaranteed the bank debt of several of our franchisees and several of our franchisees owe us significant amounts for past due invoices 
between december  and january   the sum of the overdue amounts owed to us by franchisees and our franchisee guarantee obligations increased while the aggregate net equity of the related franchisees decreased 
as of january   our franchisee guarantees totaled million  compared to million as of december  in connection with our entry into our new credit facility in march  we guaranteed an additional million of franchisee bank borrowings 
as a result of these changes  in we recorded charges of million related to potentially uncollectible franchisee receivables and retail subsidies compared to charges of million recorded in our franchisees face intense competition  which could have a material adverse effect on the results of their operations 
if we incur additional significant charges related to existing or future obligations owed to us by our franchisees  these charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the quarter and year that they are incurred 
our new operational focus may reduce our margins and ability to borrow funds from our banks and increase certain risks associated with our business 
due to the difficult economic climate  intense competition in our markets and the length of time since our last successful acquisition  we did not meet our goal of increasing our net sales by in either or as a result of these factors and our recent financial results and current financial condition  we revised our strategic plan to place a greater emphasis on improving the results of our current operations through a new focus on our in store value proposition  emphasizing our wholesale business  and reducing our debt 
although we will continue to pursue selected opportunities to grow our retail business  we do not expect to acquire any multiple store supermarket chains in if successful  our new focus on our in store value proposition may decrease our profit margins 
in addition  the decrease in our profit margins will decrease our earnings unless our sales increase by the amount required to offset the decrease in our profit margins 
if successful  our increased focus on our wholesale operations will lead to an increased number of franchised supermarkets 
in certain situations  we may need to lease the supermarkets operated by these franchisees and  in turn  sublease them to the franchisee 
such additional leases may make it more difficult for us to borrow funds from our banks and may increase the risks associated with our business if our franchisees are not able to operate their businesses profitably 
in addition  each of these new relationships will need to be assessed under fin r to determine if the franchisees will be required to be consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to improve our results of operations  focus our efforts on our wholesale business and reduce our debt will be successful 
our failure to  or delay in  successfully implementing our strategic plan may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
our increased debt  capital lease and guaranty obligations increase certain risks associated with our business 
as of january   our aggregate debt  capital lease and guaranty obligations were million  compared to million as of december  the increase in these aggregate obligations was a principal reason why we were required to pledge all of our assets as collateral under our new loan facility entered into in march  obtain a letter of credit to ensure payment of a portion of our franchisee loan guarantees and increased our interest expense 
as a result  the risks associated with our business have also increased 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to improve our results of operations  focus our efforts on our wholesale business and reduce our debt will be successful 
our failure to  or delay in  successfully implementing our strategic plan may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
our new loan facility requires collateral and imposes additional and more restrictive covenants 
due to  among other things  our recent financial results  current financial condition and the increases in our aggregate debt  lease and guaranty obligations  our banks have required us to pledge all of our assets as collateral under our new loan facility  guaranty additional amounts owed by our franchisees  obtain a letter of credit to ensure repayment of our some of our franchisee loan guarantees  grant a second security interest to a bank that has made the majority of the franchisee loans that we have guaranteed and increased our interest rate 
in addition  our new loan facility contains covenants that require us to meet certain financial and operating performance targets and prohibits us from taking certain other actions 
for example  these covenants i prohibit us from guaranteeing additional franchisee bank debt  ii prohibit us from paying cash dividends on our common stock  and iii limit our ability to repurchase our common stock 
the covenants in our new loan facility also limit our ability to incur additional debt and other obligations  including capital lease obligations 
finally  our new loan facility requires us to meet financial covenants  including covenants regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio  total senior debt cash flow leverage ratio and paid sublease ratio all as defined in our new credit facility 
these restrictions could limit our ability to implement our strategic plan  which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial results 
our new loan facility has increased the interest rates we pay 
our new credit facility required us to pledge all of our assets as collateral  increased our non default interest rate by to basis points compared to the weighted average interest rate that we paid in this increase in our interest rates may lower our earnings and increase the risks associated with our business 
our retail union workforce is a cost disadvantage 
as of january   approximately of our retail employees were covered by union contracts  all of which expire during the next five years 
our costs associated with our union employees  including the costs of the benefits provided to our union employees  have increased significantly over the past several years 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our union contracts or that our labor costs  including employee benefit costs  will not continue to increase significantly 
we have been unable to recover recent significant cost increases associated with our union employees by increasing the prices charged to our customers 
we are unlikely to be able to recover any future cost increases because several of our competitors have a competitive advantage resulting from utilizing lower cost  non union workforces 
as a result  these increases have  and any future increases will likely continue to have  a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  several companies in our industry have recently experienced prolonged strikes that have had significant adverse effects on their results of operations and financial results 
we cannot assure you that we will not suffer business interruptions as a result of strikes or other work stoppages 
any significant labor stoppage or disruption would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
increasing health care costs have lowered  and may continue to lower  our earnings 
like many other companies  we have experienced significant increases in our employee health care expenses during the past few years 
we believe that these cost increases are likely to continue in the future 
for example  we provide some of our union employees with benefits through a health  welfare and benefits plan 
from time to time  this plan may experience shortfalls because its costs exceed the payments that it receives from the companies that participate in the plan 
when this happens  we are required to make a supplemental payment to fund a portion of the shortfall 
since the beginning of  we have made supplemental payments of  to cover shortfalls in this plan and one other plan that we formerly participated in 
in addition  we have been notified that we will be required to make an additional supplemental payment of at least approximately  in because we have not been able to recover these cost increases from our customers  these increases have had  and any similar future costs likely will have  a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we may incur additional charges associated with the withdrawal from one of our multi employer health and welfare benefit plans 
recently  several employers of one of our multi employer health and welfare benefit plans have withdrawn from the plan 
because the plan is underfunded and our withdrawal is possible  we will be required to pay a portion of the underfunded liabilities associated with the withdrawal 
in the event of such withdrawal  we estimate that our withdrawal obligation is approximately  therefore  we recorded a reserve in this amount in the fourth quarter of if we are required to pay significantly more than this amount  the related charges may materially affect our financial results in the quarter and year that they are incurred 
our corporate supermarkets have suffered significant recent losses 
the profitability of our corporate supermarkets decreased considerably in in early  we decided to close six supermarkets  including five corporate supermarket  because we did not believe that we could turn around their performance in the foreseeable future given current market conditions without significant additional cost and management distraction 
we recorded million of after tax charges in relating primarily to lease termination and severance costs for stores we closed in and million of after tax charges relating to the impairment of long lived assets for the stores that we intend to close in we anticipate recognizing additional after tax charges of up to million  relating primarily to lease termination and severance costs  when we take the final steps to close six supermarkets in we expect that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of our corporate supermarkets continue to face intense competition from other supermarkets  alternative format food stores and warehouse club stores 
these competitors may have cost advantages compared to us related to their greater purchasing power and  in many cases  non union labor workforces 
we do not believe that we will record additional charges related to our corporate supermarkets in however  there can be no assurances that additional charges will not be required in or subsequent years 
these charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the quarter and year that they are incurred 
we may incur future retail repositioning charges associated with our franchised supermarkets 
certain of our franchised supermarkets continue to experience a variety of operational problems and poor financial performance 
in order to further improve our overall financial results  we continue to actively evaluate various business alternatives to these underperforming operations 
these alternatives include the potential sale of these supermarkets  conversion of franchised supermarkets into corporate supermarkets  closing supermarkets and implementing other operational changes 
other than the charges that we have already announced  we do not currently anticipate recording any charges associated with any such actions that we will take in however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant additional repositioning charges associated with our franchised supermarkets in or in subsequent years 
any such charges would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the quarter and year that they are incurred 
we experience intense  ongoing competition 
we compete with other national  regional and local food wholesalers for new franchised supermarket operations  as well as independent customers 
our wholesale competitors include supervalu inc  roundy s  inc 
and nash finch co 
most of our supermarkets are located in close proximity to  and experience intense competition from  various national  regional and local chain  franchised and independently operated supermarkets 
competing supermarkets include pick n save  cub foods  jewel food stores  sentry food stores  dominick s finer foods  festival foods  woodman s stores and copps supermarkets 
new supermarket openings or remodelings by our competitors in our markets can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
additionally  these competitors have cost advantages compared to us related to their greater purchasing power and  in many cases  non union labor workforces 
new supercenter and other alternative format store openings may hurt our business 
our supermarkets also compete with alternative format food stores  including warehouse club stores  such as sam s clubs  deep discount supercenters  such as wal mart supercenters  big kmart stores  supertarget stores and shopko stores and limited assortment grocery stores  including aldi and sav a lot stores 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
additionally  many of these competitors have a cost advantage compared to us related to their greater purchasing power and  in many cases  non union labor workforces 
over the past several years  a number of these supercenters  warehouse club stores and limited assortment grocery stores have opened in our markets 
we believe that additional supercenters  warehouse club stores and limited assortment grocery stores will open in our existing and potential new markets in the future 
these competitors have had  and will likely continue to have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
the opening of additional new supercenters and warehouse club stores and limited assortment grocery stores in our markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
a recent financial pronouncement may significantly impact our financial statements 
under current generally accepted accounting principles  the financial statements of our franchisees are not consolidated with our financial statements 
a new accounting pronouncement  fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which is scheduled to be implemented for quarterly and annual periods ending on or after march   will require financial statement consolidation in some cases where consolidation is not currently required 
we currently expect that we will be required to consolidate the financial statements of to of our franchisees to which we have made loan guarantees with our financial statements 
such consolidation would have a substantial impact on our consolidated financial statements  require us to incur additional costs to audit the financial statements of our consolidated franchisees and require management to devote significant time and efforts to such consolidation 
as a result  such consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the prevailing price of our common stock 
we may issue additional shares and dilute our existing shareholders 
in the future  we may issue additional common stock to raise funds to reduce our debt or to raise funds 
such issuances could be through a public offering  including one that would allow our shareholders to purchase sufficient additional shares of our common stock to avoid a decrease in the percent of our stock that they own  or they could be issued in one or more so called private placements to selected investors 
as a result  any share issuances would either have a dilutive effect on the relative percentage ownership interests of our existing shareholders or would require our shareholders to invest additional funds to prevent this dilution 
in addition  such issuances would decrease our earnings per share unless our earnings increase by the amount required to offset the decrease in our earnings per share due to the additional shares of our common stock 
a decrease in our earnings per share may have a material adverse effect on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that we either would  or would be able to  raise additional equity funds 
a failure to raise equity funds may limit our ability to implement our strategic plan and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we are successful in raising additional equity capital  the purchasers of our common stock may require us to appoint one or more directors that they select and or may require us to comply with operational or financial covenants 
our businesses have low margins and are sensitive to economic conditions 
our wholesale and retail supermarket operations have relatively low profit margins 
due to the difficult economic climate  intense competition in our markets  the length of time since our last successful acquisition  our recent financial results and current financial condition  we recently revised our strategic plan to place a greater emphasis on improving the results of our current operations through a new focus on our in store value proposition  emphasizing our wholesale business  and reducing our debt 
if successful  our new focus on our in store value proposition will decrease our profit margins 
in addition  the decrease in our profit margins will decrease our earnings unless our sales increase by the amount required to offset the decrease in our profit margins 
additionally  significant portions of our sales are at prices that are based on product cost plus a percentage markup 
as a result  our results of operations may be negatively impacted when consumable goods prices go down  even though our percentage markup may remain constant 
the consumable goods industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and the demand for our consumable goods has been adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
additionally  our wholesale business is sensitive to increases in fuel and other transportation related costs 
over the past several years  our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected by stagnant consumable goods prices  the downturn in the economy and increases in fuel costs 
we believe that consumable goods prices are likely to remain stagnant and may  in some cases such as beef products  decrease in the near future 
there can be no assurances that such factors will not continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
recent trends in consumers purchasing patterns have led  and may continue to lead  to reduced sales  margins and profitability 
traditionally  many consumers have purchased most or all of their paper products such as toilet paper  napkins and paper towels  laundry supplies  pet supplies  coffee  cereal and perishable items from traditional supermarkets such as our supermarkets 
however  there has been a recent trend toward purchasing these items in large quantities from alternative sources such as warehouse club stores  supercenters  discount stores or pet stores 
in addition  many consumers have recently increased the number of meals that they eat away from home and decreased their purchases from supermarkets 
finally  due to the recent economic downturn in our markets  many of our customers have recently begun trading down their purchases  buying fewer and lower priced items than in the past 
we believe that these recent trends have reduced the sales  margins and profitability of our supermarkets and our wholesale operations 
if the strategies we have developed in response to these recent trends are not successful  these trends could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we are susceptible to localized economic downturns 
all of our operations are located in wisconsin  northern illinois and eastern iowa 
as a result  downturns in the general economy in this geographic region may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
over the past several years  the economic conditions in our markets have led consumers to buy fewer and lower priced items from our supermarkets 
there can be no assurance that our customers will return to their historical purchasing patterns when the economy recovers or that we will be able to open or acquire additional wholesale distribution facilities or retail supermarkets in the number of new markets necessary to achieve geographic diversification 
unfavorable treatment by our vendors  including a decrease in our vendors promotional funds  may lower our earnings 
some of our vendors have been consolidating 
this consolidation could decrease the total amount of vendor funds available to grocery wholesalers and retailers 
in addition  vendors are trying to ensure that their promotional fees and allowances are used more effectively to directly increase the vendors sales 
as a result of such efforts  we believe that vendors are increasingly directing the majority of their promotional dollars to larger self distributing supermarket chains 
in addition  vendors sometimes offer our larger competitors promotions  packaging  payment terms and products that are not made available to us 
we expect these trends to continue 
because we are a relatively small company in our industry  we may not be able to maintain our existing levels of vendor marketing and promotional funds 
if we cannot at least maintain our existing level of these funds  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
our business information systems project presents additional significant risks 
in august  we announced a million capital expenditure project to replace and expand our current business information systems 
we subsequently expanded this project to include the front end systems for our supermarkets  including our point of sale equipment and software  which added approximately million to the total project cost 
due to uncertainties related to certain aspects of this project and our desire to reduce our capital expenditures  we recently reviewed all aspects of this project to ensure that our expenditures maximize the return on our investment 
as a result of this review  we decided to delay the roll out of the front end system phase of this project 
the delay in our front end system roll out will defer the benefits of this aspect of the project and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our significant investment in our business information systems project will increase our debt and interest expense and result in higher future depreciation costs  which will reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 
in addition  we will devote significant management time to complete the project 
there can be no guarantee that our systems project will be successful  or that it can be completed on budget 
any failure or any significant cost overruns  will likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial results and financial condition 
additionally  once we have our new business information systems in place  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize any significant management  operational or financial benefits 
potential future sales of our franchised supermarkets may reduce our sales and earnings 
the majority of our supermarkets are owned and operated by franchisees  most of whom own only one or two supermarkets 
certain of our franchisees are approaching retirement age and may  within the next few years  decide to sell their supermarkets 
historically  most of our franchisees have sold their supermarkets to parties that want to continue to operate the supermarkets as our franchisees 
however  in some instances  our franchisees may be able to sell the supermarkets for a higher price if they sell them to parties that do not want to operate them as our franchisees 
we have a right to purchase our franchised supermarkets upon termination of our franchise agreements  but as a result of our financial condition and restrictions on such transactions in our new loan facility  we may not be able to borrow the funds required to exercise such rights 
if we do not exercise our right of first refusal and allow franchised supermarkets to be sold to parties that do not want to operate them as our franchisees  we will lose the wholesale sales  earnings and cash flow associated with these supermarkets 
if we exercise our option to purchase a significant number of such franchised supermarkets during a relatively short period  we would likely be required to spend substantial amounts  probably funded through increased borrowing 
if we attempt to resell some or all such supermarkets to parties that want to continue to operate them as our franchisees  we would retain the wholesale sales and earnings associated with such supermarkets 
however  we may be required to sell them for a lower price than we paid for them  which would increase our debt and interest expense 
any significant increased debt levels that would result from such transactions would increase our interest expense  may make our financial condition more risky and susceptible to a downturn in our business and may limit our ability to pursue other franchise acquisition opportunities 
our chief executive officer position is vacant 
our senior executives  including particularly our chief executive officer  have historically coordinated the formulation and execution of our short and long term strategic plans 
as a result  our success is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team 
since november  our chief executive officer position has been vacant 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire a chief executive officer with appropriate qualifications 
a failure to hire a chief executive officer with appropriate qualifications in the near future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our success is dependent on our senior management 
our existing senior executives have many years of experience in both the supermarket retail and grocery wholesale industries 
we do not have employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our senior executives and we do not have key man insurance on any of our senior executives 
if we were to lose the services of one or more of our key senior executives  particularly before we hire a new chief executive officer  our financial results may be materially adversely affected 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain quality supermarket managers and franchise operators 
the success of our supermarkets is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain quality supermarket managers and franchise operators 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient quality retail supermarket managers and franchise operators to successfully operate our supermarkets 
failure to successfully attract and retain high quality retail supermarket managers and franchise operators could limit our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
our financial results may be adversely impacted due to product liability  food contamination or other claims 
like any other seller of food  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability or food contamination claims if the products we sell cause injury or illness 
we cannot assure you that our insurance or contractual indemnification protections will be adequate to cover these potential liabilities 
if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  consumers may change their purchasing patterns due to publicized incidents of contamination  even if such cases do not involve our supermarkets or occur in our markets 
future sudden shifts in consumer behavior may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results 
we do not expect to continue to repurchase as many of our shares as we have in the past 
as of january   only approximately million of our million board authorized common stock repurchase plan remained available for additional repurchases 
in and  we repurchased approximately  and  shares for million and million  respectively  under this plan 
due to the a prohibition on stock repurchases included in our new loan facility  our recent financial results and current financial condition and our focus on reducing our debt  we do not currently anticipate making any stock repurchases during in light of the very low average daily trading volume for our common stock on the nasdaq national market  our decision not to continue to repurchase significant additional shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for our shareholders who own significant amounts of our common stock to sell their shares without substantially reducing the trading price of our shares 
in addition  as a result of the suspension of our stock repurchases  if the participants in our retirement savings plan decide to sell a significant number of the shares of our common stock held in their plan accounts  the plan may be required to sell such shares in the public market 
any significant increase in the number of our shares sold publicly may have a material adverse effect on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
significant sales of our common stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
the average daily trading volume for our common stock on the nasdaq national market is very low 
as a result  significant purchases or sales of our common stock within a short time period in the public market may result in significant changes in the prevailing market price of our common stock 
this relative lack of trading volume makes it difficult to sell significant quantities of our common stock within a short time period in the public market 
sales of significant quantities of our common stock by any of our shareholders within a short period of time may have a material adverse effect on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
additionally  there is typically a relatively large spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock 
this spread increases the risk associated with investments in our common stock compared to stocks that have lower spreads between their bid and ask prices 
certain wisconsin laws may discourage certain takeover proposals 
wisconsin corporate law contains several provisions which may discourage non negotiated takeover proposals for us or limit or block certain business combinations between us and one of our major shareholders 
such provisions include i limiting the voting power of certain persons owning in excess of of our voting power  ii requiring a supermajority vote of shareholders to approve certain business combinations not meeting certain price standards  and iii prohibiting certain business combinations between us and one of our major shareholders for a period of three years  unless such acquisition has been approved in advance by our board of directors 
because these provisions may discourage certain acquisition proposals  our shareholders who wish to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
our shareholder rights plan could discourage certain takeover proposals 
our shareholder rights plan may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us which we have not solicited or do not approve  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
as a result  our shareholders who wish to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti takeover provisions 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that  among other things  provide for staggered terms for members of our board of directors  place certain restrictions on the removal of directors  authorize our board of directors to issue undesignated preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval  establish certain procedures to call a special meeting of shareholders  require advance notice for director nominations and certain other matters to be considered at meetings of shareholders and impose supermajority voting requirements on certain amendments to our articles and bylaws 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of our board of directors or our existing management  even if such actions would be beneficial to our shareholders

item properties 
as is typical in our industry  all of our supermarkets are leased 
we generally lease our supermarkets from nonaffiliated real estate developers under long term leases 
such leases generally contain initial terms of to years  with several five year renewal options 
none of our lease arrangements contain repurchase options and we do not own the land underlying any of such supermarkets 
a few of our leases  however  include rights of first offer running in our favor  which give us the right to advance notice of the land owner s desire to sell its property  as well as an exclusive right to submit offers to purchase these properties prior to them being made available to the general public

since then  the aggregate amount of our common stock that we can repurchase pursuant to this plan has been increased several times  most recently to its current million limit 
under this plan  we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market  pursuant to privately negotiated transactions or otherwise

our business we are a supermarket retailer and grocery wholesaler principally through corporate owned  franchised and independent supermarkets 
at the end of  we owned and operated supermarkets  a gas station and a convenience store  and we franchised an additional supermarkets 
our corporate and franchised supermarkets are sometimes collectively referred to as our supermarkets 
twenty of our corporate supermarkets operate under the piggly wiggly banner and eight of them operate under the dick s supermarkets banner 
all of our franchised supermarkets operate under the piggly wiggly banner 
we are the primary supplier to all of our supermarkets 
we also serve as a wholesaler to a number of smaller  independently operated supermarkets and convenience stores 
all of our supermarkets and other wholesale customers are located in wisconsin and northern illinois 
our operations are classified into two segments  wholesale and retail 
our wholesale business derives its revenues primarily from the sale of groceries  produce  dairy  meat  bakery and deli items and other products to our franchised supermarkets and independent retail customers 
we also supply these products to our corporate supermarkets  but those revenues are eliminated for accounting purposes in our consolidated financial statements 
we supply grocery  frozen food and produce to our supermarkets through two distribution centers in sheboygan  wisconsin 
we also provide our supermarkets with fresh  frozen and processed meats  dairy  eggs and deli items through a third party distribution facility in milwaukee  wisconsin 
additionally  we distribute items made in our platteville  wisconsin centralized bakery deli production facility to our corporate supermarkets  franchisees and independent customers 
our retail business consists of our corporate supermarkets  our gas station and our convenience store 
we earn our retail revenues by selling products purchased from our wholesale segment and other merchandise to retail consumers 
compared to our wholesale segment  our retail segment generates higher gross profit margins  but has higher selling and administrative expenses 
overview of and our new operational focus in  our net sales increased  but our net earnings decreased from million  or per diluted share  in to a net loss of million  or per share in the primary cause of the decrease in our net earnings was an increase of million of after tax charges recorded in  compared to these increased charges related to additional after tax charges of million due to the impairment of assets and other related closing costs of certain of our supermarkets  the majority of which are related to eight underperforming supermarkets  all of which we closed in or will close in as noted below  we expect to take additional significant charges related to some of these supermarket closings in  million of increased after tax charges related to potentially uncollectible franchisee receivables  million of after tax charges related to the write off of the entire value of certain financial reporting and accounting software that was purchased in connection with our business systems project  but which we will not use  compared to no similar charges incurred in  million of additional after tax charges for estimated underfunded liabilities associated with one of our multi employer union health  welfare and benefits plans  an after tax increase of million in our provision for certain health care costs related to a different  primarily self funded health insurance plan  and additional after tax professional fees of million associated primarily with these charges  our executive officer searches and several acquisitions that did not occur 
in early  we decided to close six supermarkets because we did not believe that we could turn around their performance in the foreseeable future given current market conditions without significant additional cost and management distraction 
we recorded million of after tax charges in relating primarily to lease termination and severance costs for stores we closed in and million of after tax charges relating to the impairment of long lived assets for the stores that we intend to close in we anticipate recognizing additional after tax charges of up to million  relating primarily to lease termination and severance costs  when we take the final steps to close six supermarkets in we expect that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of together  the eight supermarket closures are expected to decrease our annualized sales by approximately million and increase our annualized net earnings by approximately million 
the relative impact of these store closures on our reported revenues and net earnings in will depend upon the actual timing of the closures 
principally due to the items noted above  our financial results were significantly lower than our expectations  making our second consecutive year of disappointing financial results 
our corporate owned supermarkets  particularly our corporate piggly wiggly supermarkets  had an especially difficult year in due to increasing competition and significant increased costs associated with our union health and other benefit plans 
these cost increases further contributed to our significant cost disadvantage compared to several of our competitors that utilize non union workforces 
as a result of our financial performance over the past two years  our board of directors terminated our chief financial officer and our vice president retail operations and agreed to end our relationship with our chief executive officer 
we subsequently rehired john h 
dahly  our retired former long time chief financial officer  as our new chief financial officer and hired louis e 
stinebaugh  the former president of the milwaukee  wisconsin based sentry division of fleming companies  as our executive vice president operations 
our national search for a new chief executive officer is continuing and we believe that we will fill this position in the first half of our search includes both internal and external candidates 
with the input of our new management team  our board of directors reviewed our previous strategic plan  which included a goal of trying to achieve a compounded annual growth rate in revenue over at least a five year period beginning in this strategic plan was focused on significantly expanding our retail business  principally through acquisitions 
however  in light of our recent financial performance  current financial condition and inability to meet our revenue growth goals in either or  our board and new management team determined that it would be in the best interests of our shareholders to adopt a new operational focus that places a greater emphasis on improving the results of our current operations through focusing on our in store value proposition  emphasizing our wholesale business and reducing our debt 
this marks a return to our successful strategy utilized for many years prior to we believe that successful implementation of this new operational focus will reinvigorate our franchise system and allow us to once again generate consistent  reliable cash flows and earnings 
as a result of our focus on our in store value proposition  we expect our profit margins to decrease 
however  we believe that this investment in our margins will ultimately increase our earnings through increases in our sales 
we do not expect to realize the full benefits of our new operational focus until the focus on our consistently profitable wholesale business will include increased efforts to add new franchisees 
we expect that most such potential new franchisees will be supermarket operators that are currently supplied by one of our wholesale competitors  but we may convert some of our existing piggly wiggly corporate supermarkets to franchised supermarkets by selling them to existing or new franchisees 
we may also acquire  or arrange to acquire  certain of our existing franchisees with the intention of refranchising them to other franchise operators in order to maintain our core franchise base 
consistent with industry practice  in certain limited situations  we may continue to provide credit enhancements to certain qualified new franchisees by leasing our franchisees supermarkets and  in turn  subleasing them to franchisees and or guaranteeing a portion of the franchisees bank borrowings 
however  we will carefully analyze the benefits of each such circumstance  since these increased obligations will increase the risks associated with our operations and limit our ability to borrow funds to grow our business 
in march  we entered into a new  secured three year  million revolving credit facility with lasalle bank national association and us bank national association 
the new asset based credit facility replaced our former unsecured million revolving credit facility that was to expire on april  our new credit facility required us to pledge all of our assets as collateral  increased our non default interest rate by to basis points compared to the weighted average interest rate that we paid in and contains financial covenants and restrictions on certain corporate actions that are described in the section titled liquidity and capital resources summary below 
we believe that  combined with the expected cash flows from our operations  our new asset based credit facility will provide us with adequate liquidity through at least however  in order to facilitate obtaining a new credit facility on the most favorable terms  and in view of our recent results and financial condition and our focus on reducing our debt  we indefinitely suspended our quarterly cash dividend payments in the first quarter of and have suspended our stock repurchase program

as discussed in the section titled new accounting pronouncement below  in we will likely be required to consolidate the financial statements of certain of our franchisees with our financial statements 
we currently expect this new accounting pronouncement to require the financial statement consolidation of to of our franchisees 
because we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this could have on our consolidated financial statements  the forward looking statements herein do not include the impact of any such consolidations 
vs 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for all of our corporate and franchised supermarkets open throughout and increased in  compared to this increase was primarily due to the fact that consisted of weeks  whereas consisted of only weeks 
excluding the effects of the extra week in  comparable store sales would have increased during  compared to this increase was due to higher sales at our replacement and remodeled supermarkets  the closing of competitive stores in several of our markets in  and special promotional efforts in several of our markets 
the increases in our comparable store sales were partially offset by increasingly intense competition in many of our markets  including the opening of new supermarkets  supercenters and value oriented food and general merchandise stores  recent adverse trends in customers purchasing habits  including an increasing number of customers limiting their purchases to deeply discounted items and by purchasing lower priced items  and decreases in sales at many of our corporate piggly wiggly supermarkets 
based on our internal price indices  inflation did not have a significant effect on our sales in we expect our comparable store sales to increase nominally compared to we believe that our new operational focus  as well as anticipated higher sales at our replacement remodeled supermarkets  will be the primary contributors of such anticipated increase 
we expect that the anticipated increases due to these factors will be partially offset by competitive openings in several of our markets in retail net sales the increases in our retail net sales for  compared to  were due primarily to the factors summarized above and the january opening of our new market corporate supermarket in kenosha  wisconsin  the august opening of our replacement corporate supermarket in sheboygan  wisconsin 
this  square foot supermarket features our first combination pig stop fuel and convenience store  the september opening of our new market corporate supermarket in racine  wisconsin  and the september purchase and consolidation of a menasha  wisconsin competitive supermarket with our existing menasha supermarket 
these increases were partially offset by the factors summarized above and the december closure of our watertown  wisconsin corporate supermarket 
we believe that our retail net sales at our continuing corporate supermarkets will increase nominally in  compared to we anticipate that the successful implementation of our new operational focus will be the primary contribution to such anticipated increases 
similarly  we anticipate that our corporate supermarket openings and replacements will result in additional sales increases in  the first year that we will benefit from a full year of sales at such supermarkets 
however  we anticipate that the closure of one of our underperforming corporate supermarkets during and five additional underperforming corporate supermarkets during will result in annual retail net sales decreases of approximately million 
depending on the timing of the closure of the supermarkets to be closed in  we anticipate approximately million to million of such annual sales reductions will be realized in wholesale net sales the increase in our wholesale net sales for was due primarily to approximately million of wholesale net sales to a group of local supermarkets previously supplied by fleming companies under a temporary secondary wholesale supplier arrangement 
this arrangement ended in the third quarter of  the february opening of a replacement franchised supermarket in omro  wisconsin  the july opening of a replacement franchised supermarket in juneau  wisconsin  and the completion  during july and december  of expansion and remodeling projects at franchised supermarkets in mosinee and cross plains  wisconsin 
the increase as a result of these factors was partially offset by the factors summarized above and the july closure of our ripon  wisconsin franchised supermarket 
we believe that our wholesale net sales will increase nominally in  compared to  due primarily to the successful implementation of our new operational focus 
similarly  we anticipate that the franchised supermarkets that we replaced  expanded or remodeled in will result in additional wholesale net sales increases in  the first year that we will benefit from a full year of sales at such supermarkets 
however  we anticipate that the closure of one underperforming franchised supermarket in and one additional underperforming franchised supermarket during will result in annual wholesale net sales decreases of approximately million 
depending on the timing of the closure of the franchised supermarket during  we anticipate approximately million to million of such annual sales reductions will be realized in gross profit our gross margin did not change in  compared to  but our gross profit increased due to our increased sales 
we expect that our new operational focus will likely result in a decrease in our gross margin compared to as we invest in programs to re emphasize our in store value proposition and to increase sales volume 
however  we also anticipate that successful implementation of our new operational focus will also increase both our retail net sales and wholesale net sales  which we believe will ultimately increase our net earnings 
as a result of our and store closures  we expect the percent of our net sales that will be generated by our wholesale business to increase in  compared to because our wholesale business has lower gross margins than our retail business  such change is expected to further decrease our gross margins in  compared to selling and administrative expenses the increase in our selling and administrative expenses from million in to million in was primarily due to the following additional charges of million million after tax due to the impairment of assets and other related closing costs of certain of our supermarkets  the majority of which are related to eight underperforming supermarkets  all of which we closed in or will close in as noted below  we expect to take additional significant charges related to some of these supermarket closings in  a million increase million after tax in charges related to potentially uncollectible franchisee receivables and retail subsidies  which increased from million in to million in  million of charges million after tax related to the write off of the entire value of certain financial reporting and accounting software that was purchased in connection with our business systems project  but which we will not use  compared to no similar charges incurred in  million of charges million after tax for estimated underfunded liabilities associated with one of our multi employer union health  welfare and benefits plans  a million increase million after tax in charges for certain health care costs related to a different  primarily self funded health insurance plan  and additional professional fees of million million after tax associated primarily with these charges  our executive officer searches and several acquisitions that did not occur 
in addition  our selling and administrative expenses increased in due to increases in our health care costs  particularly cost increases associated with our retail employees  and promotional spending  including increased promotional spending in connection with the opening of several new supermarkets 
the increase in our selling and administrative expenses was partially offset by a reduction of corporate staff members early in the fourth quarter of we anticipate the annual pretax payroll savings resulting from these staff reductions  along with other reductions that have resulted from retirements  to be approximately million 
in  such savings were partially offset by related personnel severance costs and resulted in net pretax savings of million  and our other ongoing efforts to reduce our operating costs and increase our efficiency  including increasing the use of technology in our corporate supermarkets and wholesale operations 
as noted in the section titled overview of and our new operational focus above  we anticipate recording charges of up to million million after tax in as and when we take the final steps to close six supermarkets that  in the first quarter of  we announced that we would close 
it is expected that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of such charges will consist primarily of lease termination and severance costs 
we do not currently anticipate recording any other similar charges in however  due to the increasingly competitive nature of the supermarket industry and the challenging economic environment  some of our supermarkets continue to experience operational challenges 
in order to further improve our overall financial results  we continue to actively evaluate various business alternatives to these operations  including selling these supermarkets  converting franchised supermarkets into corporate supermarkets  closing supermarkets and implementing other operational changes 
if any of these actions are taken  we may incur significant charges related primarily to lease termination and severance costs 
similarly  if the financial performance of some of our franchised supermarkets continue to deteriorate  then we may incur significant additional charges for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable and retail subsidies 
as noted above  as a result of our and store closures  we expect the percent of our net sales that will be generated by our wholesale business to increase in  compared to because our wholesale business has lower selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of our sales  than our retail business  such change is expected to decrease our selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of our net sales  in  compared to net earnings our depreciation and amortization expense increased in  compared to  primarily as a result of the new corporate supermarkets that we opened in and the increase in interest expense in  compared to  was due to the additional capital lease obligations entered into in connection with two of the new corporate supermarkets in our effective tax rate was in  compared to in  as the impact of permanent tax benefits was relatively higher in relation to the narrow loss before income taxes in the decreases in net earnings from net earnings of million in to a net loss of million in and diluted earnings per share from diluted net earnings per share of in to a net loss per diluted share of in in  compared to  were caused by the factors described above 
vs 
retail net sales the increase in our retail sales for  compared to  was primarily due to our acquisition of the dick s supermarket chain  which added million to our retail sales for  compared to million for when we only realized about six months of retail sales from dick s  and sales at our new replacement corporate supermarkets in sheboygan  wisconsin and zion  illinois that opened in august and january  respectively  which were higher than sales at the supermarkets they replaced 
the increase in our retail sales as a result of these factors was partially offset by increased intense competitive activity in certain of our market areas  including competitive store openings affecting about one third of our corporate supermarkets and several of our franchised supermarkets  and overall softness of the economy and rising unemployment rates  which reduce discretionary spending and tend to cause retail shoppers to reduce their spending by purchasing less expensive products from our supermarkets 
due primarily to the above factors  comparable store sales for our corporate and franchised supermarkets were virtually flat for compared to because the dick s acquisition occurred in the second quarter of  our dick s sales were included in our comparable store sales figures for the second half of only 
the inclusion of our dick s supermarkets  which faced especially intense competition from several competitive store openings  in our comparable store sales comparisons contributed to lower than expected comparable store sales 
in contrast  in  we achieved significant comparable store sales increases in part because of competitive store closures in several of our markets 
based on our internal wholesale price index  inflation did not have any significant effect on our retail sales in wholesale net sales our net wholesale sales for increased nominally compared to the increase was largely due to our conversion of independent supermarkets to piggly wiggly supermarkets in howard and nekoosa  wisconsin in october and in cambridge  wisconsin in august additionally  our wholesale sales increased due to our march addition of a wholesale customer in oostburg  wisconsin that became a franchised supermarket in the fourth quarter of these increases were offset by wholesale sales decreases due to the continued softness in the economy and competitive store openings in several of our markets  which decreased customer count at several of our franchised supermarkets and the amount that customers  on average  spent at these supermarkets 
based on our internal wholesale price index  inflation did not have any significant effect on our wholesale sales in gross profit the significant improvement in our gross margin during was attributable primarily to the increase in our mix of retail sales to total sales resulting from the dick s acquisition  a change in the mix of items sold and reduced sale markdowns in our supermarkets 
selling and administrative expenses our selling and administrative expenses increased significantly  as a percent of sales  during compared to this increase was attributable to an increase in our percentage of retail sales to total sales resulting from the dick s acquisition  a one time  special assessment imposed by the illinois united food and commercial workers health benefits fund to eliminate the amount by which the plan s liabilities exceed the value of its assets we paid this special assessment in and  but we recognized the entire charge in  costs of  associated with our reaudit of our consolidated financial statements  and a loss of  recognized on the sale of vacant real estate 
like many employers  in  we were faced with the prospect of significant increases in our health care costs 
the impact of these increases during was mitigated  in part  by our fall introduction of employee health plan cost sharing 
from time to time  we incur significant realization charges or write offs related to our underperforming supermarkets and wholesale customers 
our total and realization charges relating to wholesale bad debts and retail subsidies were million and million  respectively 
these charges were included as a part of selling and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the retail subsidy part of these charges  which was  for and million for  and represents a discretionary amount provided to certain new or underperforming retailers  generally offset against our outstanding receivables balance for the supermarket provided the subsidy 
net earnings our increase in earnings was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 
this was partially offset by increased interest expense 
our interest expense increased due to our increased borrowings under our revolving line of credit to fund our on going business information systems project and working capital requirements 
our earnings per share increased in  compared to  due to an increase in our earnings and a nominal decrease in our weighted average common shares and equivalents 
the decrease in our diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents to  for from  for was due to repurchases of our shares  which was partially offset by the sale of shares to two local investors during the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources summary the following tables summarize our cash flow during and and other information related to our liquidity and capital resources in thousands  except for ratios variance cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   cash and cash equivalents at end of year    january  december  variance working capital current assets minus current liabilities  current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities ratio of total liabilities to shareholders investment in march  we entered into a new  secured three year  million revolving credit facility with lasalle bank and us bank 
the new credit facility replaced our former unsecured million revolving credit facility that was to expire on april  beginning in and through the date that it was replaced with our new credit facility  we were in default of certain financial covenants under our former credit facility 
our new credit facility requires us to pledge all of our assets as collateral  increases our interest rate by to basis points compared to the weighted average interest rate that we paid in in addition  our new credit facility includes covenants that prohibit us from taking certain other actions 
for example  these covenants prohibit us from guaranteeing additional franchisee bank debt  prohibit us from paying cash dividends on our common stock  and limit our ability to repurchase our common stock 
the covenants in our new credit facility also limit our ability to incur additional debt and other obligations  including capital lease obligations 
in addition  our new credit facility requires us to comply with the following financial covenants at the end of each quarter financial covenant required ratio ratio as of january  fixed charge coverage ratio total senior debt cash flow leverage ratio paid sublease ratio each of these ratios is defined in our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows from operating activities our cash disbursements occur when we pay our suppliers and when we pay for the construction of new or replacement supermarkets 
our cash inflows occur when our franchised supermarket and other wholesale customers pay us  the customers of our corporate supermarkets pay us and when we sell our new or replacement supermarkets to third parties who  in turn  lease them to us or one of our franchisees 
except for the payments received by our corporate supermarkets from their customers  all of these payments are relatively large 
as a result  our cash inflows and outflows from operating activities fluctuate depending on the timing of our receipt of payments and the timing of payments to our suppliers 
the million increase in our net cash generated from operating activities in was due primarily to a million decrease in our inventory  a million decrease in our accounts receivables  the timing of our receipt of payments and the timing of payments to our suppliers 
we anticipate substantial positive cash inflows from our operations in cash flows from investing activities for  aggregate capital expenditures were million  compared to million for our capital expenditures included million for retail equipment and fixtures primarily related to new supermarket openings  million relating to improvements at our distribution centers and bakery deli facility  million for our ongoing systems projects and million for other items 
the decrease in our capital expenditures in was a the primary cause of the decrease in cash used in investing activities in as discussed in the section titled liquidity and capital resources major commitments below  our capital budget is approximately million 
cash flows from financing activities the significant cash outflow from financing activities in was primarily due to the reduction in our debt 
during  we repaid million of our borrowings under our former revolving credit agreement  leaving borrowings of million at the end of in contrast  we added million of borrowings under this facility in net cash outflows in also increased as a result of increased stock repurchases 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock  primarily to provide liquidity to our shareholders in our retirement savings plan  for an aggregate price of nearly million an average per share price of  compared to approximately  shares aggregating million for an average per share price of 
as of the end of only approximately million of the board of directors authorized million stock repurchase program remained available for additional stock repurchases 
due to credit facility restrictions  the recent results of our operations and our focus on reducing our debt  we do not currently anticipate making any additional repurchases under our stock repurchase plan during the increase in the ratio of liabilities to shareholders investment since the end of was primarily due to the recognition of new capitalized leases for two corporate supermarkets  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
major commitments in  we will replace our existing bakery deli production facility in platteville  wisconsin with a new  substantially larger facility in platteville 
we believe that this new facility will allow us to substantially increase our sales of bakery and deli products to our corporate supermarkets  franchisees and independent customers  including potentially adding new independent customers that could not be served from our existing facility 
we also opened one new market corporate supermarket in january and plan to replace one franchised supermarket with a new  larger and more competitive supermarket in due to our new operational focus  we do not anticipate purchasing or building additional new corporate supermarkets in since the fourth quarter of  we have invested about million in our business information technology capital expenditure project and completed the infrastructure and the wholesale business segments of this project 
the remaining two segments are the retail business and services segments 
in the retail business segment  the new point of sale hardware and software has been installed at three supermarkets 
although we are continuing the rollout to all of our supermarkets  the schedule has been extended as we continue to explore ways to maximize the benefits of the new point of sale hardware and integrate the rollout with other projects at our supermarkets 
we anticipate completing this segment of our systems project in as noted in the section titled results of operations vs 
selling and administrative expenses above  in we recorded a million charge associated with the write off of the entire value of certain financial reporting and accounting software purchased in connection with the services segment of our systems project which we will not use 
we continue to evaluate whether better and more cost effective alternatives for this segment of our systems project exist 
we anticipate completing this segment of our systems project in our capital budget is approximately million  compared to our actual spending of million 
approximately million of our budget has been committed for corporate retail projects  upgrades and replacement supermarkets  million for one of our distribution centers and a new bakery deli manufacturing facility  million has been committed to our business systems project and million has been committed for other technology related projects and office renovations 
we are not currently anticipating purchasing any potential multiple store supermarket chains in  but we may acquire supermarkets from one or more of our franchisees that decide to exit the supermarket business 
any amounts that we spend in such transactions would be in addition to our current capital budget of million 
other capital commitments contractual obligations the following chart sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt   capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     purchase obligations  total contractual obligations     long term debt approximately million of the debt included in the table above was  as of january   borrowed under our former credit facility and due on april  in march  we refinanced this debt with borrowings under our new secured credit facility 
because our new credit facility expires on march   we have included the amounts we owe under this agreement as a debt that must be repaid in one to three years 
the other long term debt included in the table above relates to loans  with interest rates below those otherwise available to us  made by a local utility company in connection with the construction of several of our supermarkets that meet certain energy efficiency ratings 
capital lease obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  leases are categorized as capital leases if any of these conditions occur a the lease transfers ownership to us  b the lease contains a purchase option with a price that is well below the expected market price  c the lease term is equal to or more of the estimated life of the asset being leased  or d the present value of the lease payments on the date the lease is entered into equals or exceeds of the market value of the leased property 
our lease for one of our distribution centers and of our supermarket leases are accounted for as capital leases because the present value of the total rent payments equaled or exceeded of the market value of the leased property on the date that the leases were first entered into 
in  the amount we owed under our capital leases  including interest  increased from million to million and the amount owed to us by our franchisees under related supermarket subleases  including interest  increased from million to million 
these increases were due to two new corporate supermarket leases and four new franchised supermarket leases and subleases that we entered into in being categorized as capital leases  partially offset by lease payments made during operating lease obligations we have operating leases for both real estate and equipment used by our wholesale and retail segments 
the majority of our operating lease obligations are related to leases of our supermarkets 
we lease all of our corporate supermarkets and approximately of our franchised supermarkets 
we sublease each of our franchised supermarkets to one of our franchisees under a sublease with terms similar to those that we have with our landlords 
we enter into these transactions because they serve as credit enhancements that allow our franchisees  most of whom own only one or two supermarkets  to obtain lease terms through us that are more favorable to them than if we did not effectively guaranty their rent payments 
our other operating lease obligations relate to leases for corporate office space  transportation equipment including tractors and trailers and certain office equipment 
in  our future operating lease commitments which included both real estate and equipment subleases increased from million to million primarily due to the addition of two new corporate store leases and the extension of two other corporate store leases 
the amount committed to us in by our franchisees under real estate subleases decreased from million to million primarily due to lease payments received during forty four different franchisees have entered into subleases with us and no single franchisee or group of related franchisees has committed to us more than million under subleases 
in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above  some of our operating leases contain contingent rent provisions based on sales volume for supermarkets or miles traveled for transportation equipment 
contingent rent paid in and was million and million  respectively 
purchase obligations we have two contracts with our vendors pursuant to which we receive upfront payments in return for a commitment to purchase a minimum amount of products during the term of the contract 
if we fail to meet the minimum purchase requirements  we are typically required to repay some or all of the payments received from our vendor 
these amounts are included as other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and reduce our cost of products sold ratably over the length of the contracts 
the amounts listed in the table above represent the amounts that we may be required to pay if we do not meet the minimum purchase requirements of contracts expiring during the applicable periods 
off balance sheet arrangements the following chart sets forth information regarding our material obligations  including contingent obligations  that do not appear on our balance sheet as of january  in thousands amount of commitment expiration by period total less than year years years after years standby letters of credit   franchisee guarantees     operating lease obligations     total off balance sheet arrangements    standby letters of credit we self insure a portion of our workers compensation and general liability claims 
we currently have three standby letters of credit  all of which were established in connection with our self insurance programs 
during  the total fees for these letters of credit were less than  our letters of credit provide funds to cover claims if we are unable to pay amounts under these programs 
letters of credit of this type are common when a company self insures these types of liabilities 
two of our letters of credit expire on december   but we expect to renegotiate these letters of credit or enter into one or more letters of credit effective as of january  our other letter of credit has expired  but it is still subject to an insurance company insolvency proceeding 
we do not expect to renew this letter of credit  nor do we expect to be required to pay any additional amounts pursuant to it 
finally  in connection with our entry into a new credit facility in march  we entered into an additional million standby letter of credit 
in march  we expect to replace this standby letter of credit with a new million standby letter of credit 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our letters of credit obligations are not recorded as liabilities on our financial statements because they are contingent obligations that we do not expect to pay 
franchisee guarantees as is typical in our industry  we guarantee a portion of the bank debt of certain of our franchisees 
these guarantees are made to support the business growth of the both our franchisees and our wholesale operations 
historically  many of these guarantees have been made in pools whereby our guarantee obligations are initially of the aggregate franchisee bank debt in the pool 
the dollar amount of our guarantee for each pool remains at this amount until the aggregate franchisee debt balances in the pool are reduced below our guarantee amount  at which time our guarantee obligations are reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by each reduction in franchisee debt in the pool 
in connection with the execution of our new credit facility  we guaranteed of the bank debt of certain of our franchisees that were previously grouped in such pools 
this increased our franchisee guarantees by million 
however  we still have several guarantees that limit our obligations to of the franchisees bank borrowings 
all of these loan guarantees are collateralized  principally by the franchisee s equipment and inventory and  in some cases  with their building facility 
the guarantees are also secured by corporate indemnification agreements and personal guarantees of the franchisee 
prior to fiscal we did not record any liability related to these guarantees 
however  in  we adopted the provisions of fin and have recorded a liability for the estimated fair value of all guarantees entered into in our franchisees enter into a purchase commitment with us to purchase items from our wholesale segment in exchange for our guarantee of their debt  accordingly  we record in other non current assets a purchase commitment asset equal to the estimated fair value of the guarantee obligation 
we amortize the estimated fair value of the guarantees on a systematic basis as our guarantee exposure is reduced and we amortize our purchase commitment asset on a straight line basis over the life of the purchase commitment 
in addition  we typically provide short term financing to our franchisees and some of our wholesale customers for costs associated with the purchase of facilities  equipment and inventory for new or remodeled franchised supermarkets  as well as store construction or remodeling costs 
this financing is typically refinanced within one to two months following project completion with bank loans 
operating lease obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  operating lease obligations are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
all of our operating lease obligations that are not reflected on our financial statements relate to the type of real estate and equipment leases described in the section titled other capital commitments contractual obligations operating lease obligations above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in the section titled
