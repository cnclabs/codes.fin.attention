table of contents critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
in applying those accounting policies  management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies  assumptions and estimates to be utilized 
certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the company s reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances 
some of the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio  assumptions and judgment are applied to measure expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations 
historical loss trends are also considered  as are economic conditions  industry trends  portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data 
changes in the circumstances considered when determining management s estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions  which may result in adjustment of the allowance 
a detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses 
valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued 
quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets  such as trading assets  most investment securities  and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments 
however  for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist  management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items 
examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets  goodwill  core deposit and other intangible assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  value ascribed to stock based compensation  estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases  and certain derivative and other financial instruments 
these valuations require the use of various assumptions  including  among others  discount rates  rates of return on assets  repayment rates  cash flows  default rates  costs of servicing and liquidation values 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 
specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail in this financial review and in notes         and of notes to financial statements 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies  including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation  and their potential effects on the company s results of operations is included in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition  the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company s results of operations

average loans and leases increased billion  or  to billion in from billion in included in the average was the nine month impact of the billion of allfirst related loans and leases acquired on april  partially offsetting the impact of the higher levels of average earning assets in was a narrowing of the company s net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest margin declined basis points hundredths of one percent to in from a year earlier  due largely to lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities acquired in the allfirst transaction 
a widening of the company s net interest margin and higher average earning assets  which rose billion or from billion in  were the most significant factors contributing to the increase in s taxable equivalent net interest income from billion in net interest margin in was basis points higher than in  due to the full year impact of s declining rate environment and further changes in rates and spreads in the rise in average earning assets from to was the result of growth in the consumer loan portfolio

in  and  respectively 
net charge offs of loans acquired from allfirst were not significant during the final nine months of the provision in each year reflects the result of management s analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors  including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions  both nationally and in many of the markets served by the company  and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans 
noninterest income aggregated million in  higher than million in and up from million in approximately million of the increase from was attributable to revenues related to operations or market areas associated with the former allfirst franchise 
higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the improvement 
increased revenues from providing deposit account and mortgage banking services were significant contributors to the rise in noninterest income from to noninterest expense in totaled billion  higher than million in and up from million in included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature  consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively  amortization of goodwill of million in  and merger related expenses of million and million in and  respectively

table of contents operating expenses aggregated billion in  compared with million in and million in expenses related to operations formerly associated with allfirst significantly contributed to the higher level of expenses in compared with  along with higher expenses for salaries and benefits  professional services and amortization of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights 
partially offsetting these higher expenses was a million decrease in the provision for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights  which was million in and million in the million provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights and higher costs for salaries  including commissions and incentive compensation  were large contributors to the rise in noninterest operating expenses in as compared with the efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues 
the company s efficiency ratio  or noninterest operating expenses divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income exclusive of gains and losses from sales of bank investment securities  was in  compared with in and in the higher ratio in reflects the impact of the acquired allfirst operations that are now part of m t 
supplemental reporting of non gaap results of operations m t has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the company had recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  included in such intangible assets was goodwill of billion at december   up from billion at december  and due to the allfirst acquisition 
amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets  after tax effect  was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the higher level of such amortization in as compared with and was due to the impact of core deposit and other intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of allfirst 
since m t has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis  from which m t excludes the after tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill  core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances  net of applicable deferred tax amounts  when calculating certain performance ratios and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the company  because such expenses are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature 
although net operating income as defined by m t is not a gaap measure  m t s management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results

the growth in average earning assets was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding  which totaled billion in  up from s average of billion 
the most significant factor for the higher loan balances in was the nine month impact of the billion of loans obtained in the allfirst acquisition on april  such acquired loans were comprised of approximately billion of commercial loans and leases including million of leveraged leases and million of loans to foreign borrowers  billion of commercial real estate loans  million of residential real estate loans and billion of consumer loans and leases 
average consumer loans and leases  excluding those acquired in the allfirst transaction  grew to billion in from billion in increases in the outstanding average balances of automobile loans and leases of billion and home equity lines of credit of million were the leading contributors to that growth 
partially offsetting the growth noted above was a decline in the residential real estate loan portfolio  due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of two separate securitization transactions totaling billion of such loans during s fourth quarter and the full year impact of a similar billion securitization in the fourth quarter of in connection with the first securitization transaction  the company transferred approximately million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to a qualified special purpose trust 
the company received million in cash and retained approximately of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans 
the company realized a gain of million on the transaction which has been included in other revenues from operations 
in s second securitization transaction  approximately million of one to four family residential mortgage loans were converted to mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma 
all of those mortgage backed securities were retained by the company and  accordingly  no gain or loss was recognized 
in total  approximately billion of mortgage backed securities resulting from s securitization transactions were retained by the company and included in the portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale 
taxable equivalent net interest income in was higher than billion in  when average earning assets aggregated billion 
a increase in average loans and leases from to  coupled with a widening of the company s net interest margin  were the most significant factors for the higher level of taxable equivalent net interest income in as compared with average outstanding balances of consumer loans and leases rose billion  or  from to such growth  predominantly in outstanding home equity lines of credit and automobile loans  more than offset declines in the commercial loan and lease and residential real estate loan portfolios 
the lower average balances of commercial loans and leases were due in part to the sluggish economic conditions in the company s core markets 
the residential real estate loan portfolio s decline was due largely to customer repayments of loans and the impact of the november securitization of approximately billion of such loans 
similar to one of the securitizations already discussed  in connection with

the company received million in cash and retained approximately of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans 
the company realized a gain of million on the transaction which has been included in other revenues from operations 
in accordance with gaap  the qualified special purpose trusts related to the and mortgage loan securitization transactions are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the resulting mortgage backed securities provide enhanced liquidity opportunities to the company because the securities may be more readily pledged to secure borrowings or sold than the underlying loans could be 
additionally  under present regulatory risk based capital rules  the company is generally required to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital when directly investing in residential real estate loans than when investing in government guaranteed or highly rated  privately placed mortgage backed securities

further information on such interest rate swap agreements is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition to changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income 
net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  down from in the yield on earning assets during was  down basis points from in  while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to from in lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the allfirst merger contributed to the reduced yields on earning assets in when compared with and were the leading cause for the lower year over year net interest spread 
the decreases in interest rates earned and paid also reflect generally lower market interest rates in as compared with  including the impact of reductions by the federal reserve of its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate of basis points in november and basis points in june the federal reserve also took numerous actions throughout to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by basis points 
in general  the full year impact of such actions combined with the basis point reduction in november contributed to a greater decline in s short term rates on deposits and borrowings as compared with the decline in yields on loans and other earning assets 
as a result  the impact of changing interest rates had a positive effect on the company s net interest spread in as compared with the yield on the company s earning assets decreased basis points in from in  while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in was down basis points from 
the impact of the more rapid repricing of interest bearing liabilities than earning assets combined with the full year impact of s interest rate reductions led to a basis point increase in the company s net interest spread  from in to in net interest free funds consist largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non earning assets  including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets 
average net interest free funds totaled billion in  billion in and billion in the higher level of average net interest free funds in was due largely to the impact of the allfirst 
table of contents acquisition  which provided  on average for  noninterest bearing deposits of billion and stockholders equity of billion  partially offset by goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets of billion and bank owned life insurance of million 
the increase in average net interest free funds in as compared with was largely the result of higher levels of noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in  billion in and billion in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged million in  million in and million in increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income  but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations 
the contribution of net interest free funds to net interest margin was 
in  compared with 
in and 
in the decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in and compared with resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution  offset  in part  by higher balances of net interest free funds 
reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest free funds as described herein  the company s net interest margin was in  compared with in and in as noted previously  lower yielding portfolios of loans and investment securities obtained in the allfirst acquisition contributed to the lower net interest margin in as compared with nevertheless  the net interest margin declined in each quarter of as a result  the net interest margin of in s fourth quarter was the lowest quarterly net interest margin earned by the company since the first quarter of the company s net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely impacted by future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios 
in managing interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was million 
in general  under the terms of these swap agreements  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
as of december   all of the company s interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges 
in a fair value hedge  the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings 
the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the company s consolidated statement of income 
in a cash flow hedge  unlike in a fair value hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately 
the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in  and were not material to the company s results of operations 
the estimated fair values of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented a loss of approximately million at december   compared with a gain of million at december  the fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items 
the estimated fair value of the 
table of contents interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately million at december  net of applicable income taxes  such loss was approximately thousand and was included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates

at december  the increase in the amount of loans classified as nonperforming at december  as compared with a year earlier reflects the inclusion of approximately million of such loans obtained in the allfirst acquisition 
the higher level of nonperforming loans at december  compared with december  was largely the result of the inclusion at the year end of three commercial loans totaling million that were classified as nonperforming during outstanding balances relating to those same three loans included in nonperforming loans at december  totaled million  including a million portion obtained in the acquisition of allfirst

management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications 
management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the company s exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for such losses as of each reporting date 
factors also considered by management when performing its assessment  in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above  included  but were not limited to i the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  ii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic 
table of contents growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country  iii significant growth in loans to individual consumers  which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types  and iv the large portfolios of loans obtained in the acquisition of allfirst which management continues to evaluate in accordance with the company s policies and procedures for credit underwriting  loan classification  and measurement of exposure to loss 
the level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of management s analysis 
management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of december  in light of i the uncertain status of the overall economic recovery  ii the mixed economic indicators being proffered by government economists and others  and iii given the relative size of the acquired allfirst loan portfolios  the status of management s ongoing detailed credit reviews of such portfolios 
although there are signs that the national economy has improved and optimism about its future outlook is growing  concerns exist about stagnant job growth  which could cause consumer spending to slow  higher interest rates  which could adversely impact the housing market  continued stagnant population growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions  and sluggish commercial loan demand 
in ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases 
the total allowance for credit losses  therefore  includes both specific and inherent base level loss components  as well as inherent unallocated loss components 
the following paragraphs describe these components 
the amount of specific loss components in the company s loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all commercial and commercial real estate loans which are in nonaccrual status 
specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans greater than  when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation 
measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  are evaluated for specific loss components 
except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively  the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
loans less than days delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired 
the inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and management s classification of such loans under the company s loan grading system 
the company utilizes a loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits 
loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the company s credit policy 
internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the company s loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards 
loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained 
loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the company s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases 
items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results  collateral value  financial condition  payment status  and other factors  levels of and 
table of contents trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries  levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans  changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios  trends in volume and terms of loans  national and local economic conditions and trends  and observed trends and practices in the banking industry 
the specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses 
such allocated portion of the allowance represents management s assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable 
the inherent unallocated allowance includes management s subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties  customer  industry and geographic concentrations  and expansion into new products and market areas 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the company  specifically new york state and central pennsylvania  that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas entered through acquisitions  iv the introduction of new loan and lease product types  including loans and leases to foreign and domestic borrowers obtained through acquisitions  v additional risk associated with growth in the company s portfolio of consumer loans in recent years  in particular automobile loans and leases  which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans  vi the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance  and vii additional uncertainty resulting from acquired loan portfolios to be fully analyzed by the company s loan review department in order to become familiar with the underlying characteristics of the portfolios and specific borrowers 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values in the new york city metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate  economic conditions and interest rates  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property 
the tragic events of september  further dampened the economic outlook for the united states  which in and experienced its first significant downturn in many years 
the economies of new york state  and new york city in particular  were specifically damaged by the events of september  economic performance of the most significant market regions served by the company during was mixed 
private sector job growth in the upstate new york market approximated the national average which was a slight decline from 
the manufacturing oriented metropolitan areas of buffalo  rochester and syracuse continued to experience weakness  including announced corporate layoffs in those areas 
in the hudson valley region of new york state  private sector job growth was more than one full percentage point higher than the national average compared with job loss of 
nationally 
also better than the national average for private sector job growth were the maryland  northern virginia and southeastern pennsylvania regions  whereas the binghamton  new york and eastern pennsylvania regions  largely manufacturing oriented  lagged the national average 
these mixed signals on private sector job growth  combined with concerns about higher interest rates  high levels of consumer indebtedness  lack of population growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions and other factors  continue to indicate an environment of economic uncertainty  both in the markets the company serves and for the national economy 

table of contents table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein 
variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in management s estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components 
as described in note of notes to financial statements  loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
were million at both december  and the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to 
and 
of gross loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the unallocated allowance as a percentage of loans from the year end to december  reflects the factors already described  including prolonged uncertainty about regional and national economic conditions and the status of management s ongoing credit reviews of the loans obtained in the acquisition of allfirst 
as already noted  management continues to evaluate the loan portfolios obtained in the allfirst transaction in accordance with the company s credit policies and procedures 
the slight decrease in the unallocated portion of the allowance from december  to december  reflects the modest impact of improving economic conditions near s year end 
given the company s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in new york state  including the upstate new york region  and central pennsylvania  and considering the other factors already discussed herein  management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable 
nevertheless  the company s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date

m t bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb aggregating billion at december  outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
m t bank and m t bank  na had available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york at december  totaling approximately billion 
the amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either december  or as previously noted  in anticipation of the allfirst acquisition  m t bank issued million of subordinated notes on march  to provide liquidity to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to aib and to maintain appropriate regulatory capital ratios 
as an additional source of funding  in november  the company entered into a million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately million of automobile loans and related assets 
the automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of m t bank 
as existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down  monthly proceeds  after payment of certain fees and debt service costs  are used by the subsidiary to obtain additional automobile loans from m t bank or another of its subsidiaries to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base 
additional information about this borrowing is included in note of notes to financial statements 
informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
short term federal funds borrowings aggregated billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in general  these borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day 
should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings  or should the availability of short term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets  the company s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted 
the company attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short term ratings downgrade over various grading levels 
the company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit  available capacity from secured borrowing sources 
table of contents and securitizable assets 
information about the credit ratings of m t and m t bank is presented in table additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the company s short term and long term borrowings is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
the company serves in the capacity of remarketing agent for variable rate demand bonds vrdbs  in a line of business obtained in the allfirst acquisition 
the vrdbs are enhanced by a direct pay letter of credit provided by m t bank 
holders of the vrdbs generally have the right to sell the bonds to the remarketing agent with seven days notice  which could result in m t bank owning the vrdbs for some period of time until such instruments are remarketed 
when this occurs  the vrdbs are classified as trading assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the value of vrdbs in the company s trading account totaled million at december  as of december   the total amount of vrdbs outstanding backed by an m t bank letter of credit was billion 
the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments 
as of december   the contractual amounts and timing of those payments are summarized in table the company also has off balance sheet commitments to customers that may impact liquidity  including commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  commercial letters of credit  financial guarantees and indemnification contracts  and commitments to sell real estate loans 
since many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows 
further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
table summarizes the company s other commitments as of december  and the timing of the expiration of such commitments 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
dividends from any banking subsidiary to m t are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years 
for purposes of the test  at december  approximately million was available for payment of dividends to m t from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
these historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities 
information regarding trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  a similar million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at december  on an ongoing basis  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business 
management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change 
as a result  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability 
table of contents of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities  and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and non parallel shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was million 
information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the company s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken actions  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for risk management purposes 
table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year 
many assumptions were utilized by the company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income 
the more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve month period  including incremental and basis point rate changes 
in the event that a or basis point rate change cannot be achieved  the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates  market conditions  and interest rate differentials spreads between and within maturity repricing categories  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter such changes 
in light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process  the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the company s past or projected net interest income 
in accordance with industry practice  table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest 
table of contents rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company has historically engaged in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers  to fund the company s obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and  to a limited extent  to profit from perceived market opportunities 
financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities  mutual funds and interest rate contracts  such as swap agreements 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee 
however  as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument  the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the company s trading activities 
the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
however  the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the higher amounts of trading account assets and liabilities at december  reflect the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts executed with customers associated with allfirst and the related offsetting trading positions 
included in trading account assets at december  and were million and million  respectively  relating to deferred compensation plans 
changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income 
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and were million and million  respectively  of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans 
changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income 
given the company s policies  limits and positions  management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material 
additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note of notes to financial statements

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system  which is organized by strategic business unit 
certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services  the type of customer  and the distribution of those products and services are similar 
the reportable segments are commercial banking  commercial real estate  discretionary portfolio  residential mortgage banking and retail banking 
the financial information of the company s segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note of notes to financial statements 
the management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and  unlike financial accounting  are not based on authoritative guidance similar to gaap 
as a result  reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions 
furthermore  changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data 
financial information about the company s segments is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
the commercial banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle market and large commercial customers  largely within the markets the company serves 
services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing  deposit products  and cash management services 
net income contributed by the commercial banking segment totaled 
table of contents million in  up from million in the favorable performance from the prior year was predominately the result of the allfirst acquisition  which contributed to increases in net interest income on loans of million  service charges on deposit accounts of million and credit related fees of million  partially offset by higher operating expenses of million 
the improvement was also aided by a decline in net charge offs from  largely the result of a million loss in related to two commercial leases to a major airline company that filed for bankruptcy 
net charge offs for the commercial banking segment were million in and million in net income for this segment totaled million in the decline in net income in as compared with was attributable to the million charge off described above and a million decrease in net interest income  due to a basis point narrowing of the segment s net interest margin

activities of this segment also include the origination  sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the fnma dus program 
the commercial real estate segment s net income was million in  up from million in the increase was due to higher net interest income of million  largely the result of average loan balances acquired in the allfirst transaction and a higher net interest margin on loans in the non allfirst regions  and commercial mortgage banking revenues of million resulting largely from the allfirst acquisition 
partially offsetting these revenue increases were higher salaries and benefits and other operating expenses that also resulted from the allfirst acquisition 
net income in for the commercial real estate segment was higher than the million earned in that increase was due largely to an million increase in net interest income  the result of a basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans and a increase in average loan balances outstanding 
the discretionary portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities  residential mortgage loans and other assets  short term and long term borrowed funds  brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto  and offshore branch deposits 
this segment also provides services to commercial customers and consumers that include foreign exchange  securities trading and municipal bond underwriting and sales 
the discretionary portfolio segment recorded net income of million in  higher than million in  primarily the result of higher net interest income from investment securities  including securities acquired in the allfirst transaction 
in  this segment s net income was million 
the increase in net income from to was predominantly due to an million increase in net interest income  largely the result of a basis point rise in the net interest margin on investment securities

the residential mortgage banking segment earned million in  up from the million earned in the results include a million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities  including gains from sales of loans to the company s discretionary portfolio segment  and a million increase in net interest income  due largely to higher average 
table of contents balances of outstanding loans and deposits 
gains from sales of loans to the company s discretionary portfolio segment were million and million in and  respectively 
also contributing to the segment s improved net income was a decrease in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights  which was million lower than in partially offsetting the revenue increases noted above were higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses of million  exclusive of the impact of changes in the provision for impairment of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights already noted 
the segment s net income in was lower than s total of million 
that decrease from was attributable to a million increase in the provision for impairment of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing rights and a million increase in salaries  commissions and other operating expenses 
mitigating the impact of those higher expenses was a million increase in net interest income  the result of a higher loan net interest margin and higher average loan balances outstanding  increased loan servicing revenues of million  largely the result of purchased servicing rights  and a million increase in revenues from loan origination and sales activities

in the non allfirst regions  a million decrease in net interest income attributable to deposits  due to a basis point decline in net interest margin  was partially offset by a million increase in net interest income on loans  resulting from increases in indirect automobile loan and home equity line of credit balances outstanding of and  respectively 
earnings for this segment declined in from million in a million reduction in net interest income was a significant contributor to such decline 
a lower deposit net interest margin of basis points  largely attributable to the impact of the year s low interest rate environment  and a decrease in retail deposit balances led to an million decline in net interest income 
partially offsetting this decline was higher loan net interest income of million  primarily the result of a increase in average loan balances outstanding 
also contributing to the lower earnings in was a million increase in the provision for credit losses and increased operating expenses of million  offset  in part  by an million increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
the all other category reflects other activities of the company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 such as the m t investment group  which includes the company s trust  brokerage and insurance businesses 
also reflected in this category are the amortization of goodwill in and core deposit and other intangible assets  merger related expenses resulting from acquisitions  and the net impact of the company s allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses 
the various components comprising the all other category resulted in net losses of million in and million in  and net income of million in the net loss in 
table of contents was largely the result of merger related costs  core deposit intangible amortization  and  largely as a result of the allfirst acquisition  higher operating expenses that under the company s cost allocation methodologies were not allocated to the company s reportable segments 
also contributing to the net loss were higher provisions for credit losses 
the improvement in from was due to the company s allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing  combined with the cessation of amortization of goodwill resulting from the january  adoption of sfas no 
recent accounting developments fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin as required  and such adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the fasb s stated intent in issuing fin was to clarify the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity as defined in fin if that enterprise has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns if they occur  or both 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fin fin r which attempts to clarify the guidance in the original interpretation 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january  fin also applies to all variable interest entities created prior to february  that are considered to be special purpose entities as defined in fin r as of december  fin r must be applied to all variable interest entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  as described in note of notes to financial statements  implementation of the new accounting provisions related to investments in variable interest entities resulted in the removal of trusts that had issued trust preferred securities from the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  accordingly  at december   the company included the junior subordinated debentures payable to such trusts as long term borrowings in its consolidated balance sheet 
prior to that date  the company included the capital securities of the trusts in its consolidated balance sheet as long term borrowings  with accumulated distributions on such securities included in interest expense 
that change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the company  had no material or substantive impact on the company s financial statements as of and for the year ended december   had no impact on s average balances noted herein  and resulted in the company recognizing million in other assets for its investment in the common securities of the trusts that had issued the trust preferred securities that will be concomitantly repaid to m t by the respective trusts from the proceeds of m t s repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities described in note of notes to financial statements
