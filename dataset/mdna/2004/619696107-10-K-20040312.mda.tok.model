item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in this form k commencing on page f results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our financial results are significantly impacted by our staffing levels and key executive compensation  and by the retail sales of our mossimo branded products under the licensing and design services agreement with target  which is exclusive to the united states 
under the target agreement  we earn fees based on percentage of target stores net sales of mossimo branded product 
the percentage varies according to the volume of sales 
we earn on the first million of sales  on million to million of sales  and on sales above million each year 
as a result  we recognize a higher level of revenues early in the year when the higher rates apply to the net retail sales base 
revenues from target were and of total revenues in and  respectively 
this change was primarily due to the introduction of our mossimo branded products into canada during march of  under a licensing and design services agreement with hudson s bay company for distribution thru its zellers stores exclusively in canada 
the canadian business has diversified our customer base and expanded our territory coverage of the mossimo brand 
total revenues were approximately the same in and at million 
however  in we recognized million in revenues which had been deferred during the initial target contract year pending the results of an audit that was completed in second quarter of excluding the million of non recurring revenue in  total revenue in increased by million  or  and revenue from target increased from the increase in revenue from sources other than target were primarily due to the new canadian business 
we expect increases in future revenues from canada  as well as modest increases in future revenues from target 
the major components of selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses are payroll and personnel  executive bonuses  commissions payable to a third party in connection with the target agreement  and expenses incurred in connection with design related and business development activities such as travel  samples and artwork purchases  and free lance artists  as well as facilities  legal  accounting  and insurance expenses 
our s  g a increased approximately  or from to  principally due to increases in personnel and related payroll expenses of approximately  and increases in design related and business development activities expenses of approximately  which was partially offset by reductions in executive bonuses of  and commissions of  the increases in personnel and design related activities were necessary to better serve the target business in the united states  and to launch the new canadian business with zellers 
executive bonuses were reduced consistent with the company s comparative performance 
these bonuses which are determined at the discretion of the board of directors  in accordance with a performance criteria outlined in the respective bonus plans  and are subject to a maximum annual amount based on a percent of target license royalty fees in excess of the minimum annual fee  are estimate and accrued on a quarterly basis  with a final determination made by the board of directors at the end of each year 
commissions were less this year because of the non recurring target revenue recognized last year 
we continue our business development activities in search of growth opportunities for the company 
we do not expect that further increases in staff or design related activities will be necessary in order to service the target and zellers business in the future 
as further discussed in item legal proceedings of this report  we have a dispute over the commissions payable to a third party which relate to our agreement with target 
in connection with pursuing our claim  we incurred  in and  in these costs include interest and legal fees that would be due to the third party in the event that our appeal to the supreme court of the state of california fails 
in addition to these costs  accrued and unpaid commissions payable to the third party would also be due 
we accrue these costs based on the contractual rate for commissions  based on the maximum legal rate for interest of applied to the unpaid balance  and based on estimates of legal fees incurred by the third party when such estimates are reasonably determinable 
total amount of accrued commissions  interest and legal fees at december  was approximately million  and sufficient cash had been segregated and was available to pay this amount if necessary 
we expect to incur additional commissions under the underlying agreement  plus interest on the unpaid amounts  and legal fees for as long as we continue to pursue this claim 
at the end of we completed our assessment of the benefit to be derived from our tax net operating loss carry forward and recorded a benefit for income taxes of million  which increased our diluted net earnings per share by 
we reduced the valuation allowance previously provided against our deferred tax asset  as a result of the extension of the target agreement through january   and the reevaluation of our forecasted operating results and resultant taxable income during the extended term of the target agreement  and the consequent expected utilization of available net operating losses during the extended term of the target agreement 
in we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million  which decreased diluted net earnings per share by  this provision is based on the applicable statutory rates for federal and california state taxes  at an effective rate of  net of an additional deferred tax asset of approximately  recognized in a substantial amount of the provision for income taxes is a deferred expense and represents a reduction of the corresponding deferred tax asset to reflect the utilization of our tax net operating loss carry forwards 
diluted net earnings per share were in and in however  we believe that it is important to compare pretax diluted earnings per share of in and in  because of the significant impact that the benefit for income taxes has on the net earnings 
the recent acquisition of the modern amusement assets was completed in january  and has no material impact on operating results for we do not expect that modern amusement will have a significant impact in the near term on the company s operating results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues from target were of total revenues in and  and total revenues increased approximately to approximately million in  from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to a increase in normal ongoing revenues from target  and revenues of million recognized in  which had been deferred during the initial target contract year pending the results of a royalty audit completed in second quarter of  which is not expected to recur 
the remaining revenues are derived from license fees from other agreements 
our s  g a increased approximately million  or in from  principally due to increases in personnel related payroll of approximately million  increases in commissions of approximately  increases in design related and business development activities expenses of approximately  and increases in other s  g a expenses of approximately  the increases were partially offset by reductions in executive bonuses of approximately million 
the bonus plan covering the company s chief executive officer was changed in to a discretionary plan  not to exceed a formula based amount  from strictly a formula based plan in during  the discretionary bonuses  not to exceed the formula  were determined at the discretion of the board of directors and were lower than those calculated under the formula 
the company s total personnel increased from eight employees at the beginning of to twenty employees by the end of the increases in personnel and design related activities were necessary to better serve the target business in the united states  and to implement the new canadian business with zellers  which was expected to fully launch in march commissions are directly related to target revenue and the increase is consistent with same 
other s  g a expenses increased primarily due to expenditures incurred in connection with initiating the company s listing on nasdaq in april as further discussed in item legal proceedings of this report  at the beginning of  we began to pursue a claim in connection with a dispute over commissions payable to a third party which relate to our agreement with target  and we incurred approximately  in related costs during these costs include incremental interest and legal fees that would be due to the third party in the event that a final decision is rendered in their favor 
in addition to these costs  accrued and unpaid commissions payable to the third party would also be due 
the total amount of accrued commissions  interest and legal fees at december  was approximately million 
we incurred net interest expense of approximately  in  compared to net interest expense of approximately  in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the applicable variable interest rate  reductions of the outstanding balance of the loan payable to a bank  and additional interest income earned in at the end of we completed our assessment of the benefit to be derived from our tax net operating loss carry forward and recorded a benefit for income taxes of million  as compared to a benefit for income taxes of million recorded in in  we further reduced the valuation allowance previously provided against our deferred tax asset  as a result of the extension of the target agreement through january   and the reevaluation of our forecasted operating results and resultant taxable income during the extended term of the target agreement  and the consequent expected utilization of available net operating losses during the extended term of the target agreement 
diluted net earnings per share were in  and in however  we believe that it is important to compare pretax earnings per share of in  and in  because of the significant impact that the benefit for income taxes has on net earnings 
liquidity and capital resources we have generated substantial amounts of cash from operations in the past two years 
however  we have not paid million of cumulative commissions and other costs due a third party as further discussed in item legal proceedings of this report 
accordingly  we have accumulated a total cash balance of approximately million as of december  we have segregated million of the total cash balance from our normal operating funds in order to have it available to settle amounts due to the third party under the legal dispute in the event that a final decision is rendered in their favor 
we deposited million of the total million with the court having jurisdiction over this matter and classified this amount as restricted cash in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  the balance of approximately million has been segregated in a separate company account and included with cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  aside from the million we have approximately million of cash available for normal operations 
if the payment of the million is required as a result of a court order  such a payment is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity 
we have been effective at paying off all outstanding indebtedness and we are well positioned to satisfy our contractual obligations and ongoing operating requirements 
because of our certainty of contractual guaranteed minimums under the target agreement  and our relatively high operating margins  we are confident in our ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations 
further  the available net operating loss carry forward will significantly reduce our tax payments at least thru january during  we repaid the remaining million of bank debt 
we have no current plans to incur new debt obligations or to enter into new long term contractual obligations  capital leases  or significant capital projects 
there were no significant changes in our cash flows in as compared to the primary cash sources are from fees collected under our design services and licensing agreements  primarily target 
our most significant cash outflow is our personnel costs  including bonuses 
we have a commission obligation under an agreement with a third party for of fees received from target for the duration of the target agreement thru january  and for subsequent extensions if they are exercised by target 
no cash payments were made for commissions in  although all commissions of approximately million due in under contract were accrued at december  future commission amounts will vary depending on the fees to be received from target 
the underlying agreement is in dispute  as further discussed in item legal proceedings of this report  and there is no assurance that this agreement with the third party could be terminated 
we anticipate having the resources available to meet the obligations under this agreement as they become due  regardless of the final resolution of the dispute 
in january we completed the acquisition of the modern amusement assets and we amended our facility lease increasing our space from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet  and extending the lease term thru july the expanded facility is intended to also accommodate modern amusement 
the future annual obligation under the amended lease varies each year  starts at approximately  in  increasing to  in the purchase price of the modern amusement assets of  plus the acquisition costs were funded with existing cash 
we are in the process of finalizing the business plans for modern amusement  including the required cash and liquidity resources which are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources in  due to the size of the acquired business being relatively small 
future cash and liquidity resources required beyond will depend on our planned expansion of the modern amusement business 
the company is approached from time to time by parties seeking to sell their businesses  brands and related trademarks 
should an established viable business and marketable brand become available on favorable terms  the company may be interested in pursuing such an acquisition and may elect to fund such acquisition  in whole or in part  with available cash as well as different financing alternatives  including the issuance of debt instruments and or equity securities

critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from license royalties and design service fees are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements  which is generally after the design services are performed  and as the licensee achieves sales of the company s products 
revenue from license royalties and design service fees are generally collected on a quarterly basis  and they range from one percent to seven percent of sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
a substantial amount of the company s revenue is generated under the target agreement  under a declining rate as the year progresses and target achieves certain levels of retail sales 
accordingly  the company s revenues from target decrease as the year progresses 
the declining rate is reset each contract year on february in  target reached the minimum rate during the third quarter of the company s calendar year 
if target sales of mossimo branded products increase in the future  as a result of opening new stores or otherwise  the minimum rate of fees may apply earlier in the company s future calendar years  shifting additional revenue recognition to the first half of the year  and potentially reducing the revenue recognition in the second half of the year 
a decrease of target sales of mossimo branded product in the future could have a material impact on the company s total revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
deferred tax asset valuation the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred taxes primarily result from the recognition of the income tax benefit to be derived from the company s net operating loss carry forward for income taxes purposes 
as of december   the company has approximately million  and million of federal and state income tax net operating loss carry forwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income  which expires in various years through at december   the company recorded a deferred income tax asset of approximately million  upon reducing the related valuation allowance for its deferred income tax asset  as a result of the extension of the target agreement through january   and the reevaluation of its forecasted operating results and resultant taxable income during the extended term of the target agreement  and the consequent expected utilization of available net operating losses during the extended term of the target agreement 
the company monitors its profitability and considers the credit and collections risk of future fees under its agreements 
the company factors in the term of the related agreements and extensions that are more likely than not to be exercised  particularly in connection with the target agreement  in the analysis of the recoverability of its deferred tax asset 
contingencies and litigation management evaluates contingent liabilities including pending or threatened litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 and records accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the amount of the liability is subject to reasonable estimate 
management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside counsel 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on its operations 
since the company s future revenues are based on a percentage of sales of licensed products by licensees  the company does not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on future operations 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for all its revenue from license royalties and design service fees  other than from its business in canada  which began in and does not represent a substantial amount of revenue at this time 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s operating results 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to exchange rate risk 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no

sfas no

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
arb  consolidated financial statements  and requires companies to evaluate variable interest entities for specific characteristics to determine whether additional consolidation and disclosure requirements apply 
the provisions of fin for certain variable interest entities were delayed until the fourth quarter of this interpretation is immediately applicable for variable interest entities created after january   and applies to fiscal periods beginning after june  for variable interest entities acquired prior to february  this interpretation also requires extensive disclosures  including disclosures that are applicable to december  financial statements

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements of a guarantor in accounting for and disclosing certain guarantees issued and outstanding 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the company licenses its trademarks  provides design services and has approval rights for product design  marketing and advertising materials under licensing and design service agreements which include certain provisions for indemnifying the licensee 
as an element of its standard commercial terms  the company includes an indemnification clause in its licensing and design services agreements that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages arising from any claims  suits  damages  or costs relating to the breach of any warranty  representation  term or condition made or agreed to by its licensees involving the manufacture  packaging  distribution  promotion  sale  marketing  advertising or other use of the trademarks under license 
we believe that our policies and practices limit our exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the license and design services agreements 
for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the license and design services agreements  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions
