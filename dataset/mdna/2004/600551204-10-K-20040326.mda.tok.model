item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may be deemed to be forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are made based on our management s belief as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to  among other things  factors set forth below under the heading risk factors  and in particular  the risks associated with the wind down of the towing services segment and the risks associated with the terms of our substantial indebtedness 
such factors are not exclusive we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by  or on behalf of  our company 
risk factors we have a high level of indebtedness and certain requirements that we must comply with under our credit facilities that may affect the growth and profitability of our business 
as of january  our debt included approximately million under our senior credit facility and million under our junior credit facility 
this amount includes approximately million under our junior credit facility that was later converted into common stock upon the completion of the exchange described under the heading related party transactions 
as a consequence of our level of indebtedness  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations as well as from sales of our distributorships must be dedicated to debt service requirements 
the terms of our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  incur liens  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or their assets 
our credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial tests and comply with certain other reporting  affirmative and negative covenants 
we have experienced difficulties meeting these financial tests in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
in addition  our substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
our credit facilities are collateralized by liens on all of our assets 
the liens give the lenders the right to foreclose on our assets under certain defined events of default and such foreclosure could allow the lenders to gain control of our operations 
our former independent auditors included a going concern explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements for the year ended december  as a result of our condition of being in default of certain covenants under our junior and senior credit facilities and as a result of our junior credit facility maturing in our junior credit facility has since been restructured and we have entered into an amendment with the junior lenders whereby the debt under the junior credit facility will not be due until july  if we were to fail to comply with the requirements under the credit facilities  such non compliance would result in an event of default  which if not waived by the lending groups would result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the respective credit facility as well as other remedies 
under these circumstances  we could be required to find alternative funding sources  or to sell assets 
there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such refinancing or that we would be able to sell assets on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we were to be unsuccessful in our efforts to refinance the credit facility  we might be required to seek bankruptcy court or other protection from our creditors 
for more information regarding the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our liquidity  see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the wind down of our towing services division may divert the attention of our management from our core manufacturing business and we still have retained certain liabilities related to the towing services division 
we sold all of our towing services businesses in a relatively short period of time during fiscal the net cash proceeds from these sales exceeded the roadone revolving commitment under the senior credit facility associated with the sold operations  as well as other associated liabilities 
almost all of these businesses will continue to operate under new ownership and in general their customary operating liabilities will be assumed by the new owners 
we nevertheless will be subject to some continuing liabilities with respect to the pre sale operations of these businesses  including  for example  liabilities related to litigation  certain trade payables  parent guarantees  workers compensation and other insurance  surety bonds  and real estate 
it is possible that the sale proceeds and the remaining assets of the towing services segment will not be sufficient to satisfy such liabilities 
we may also be subject to inefficiencies  management distractions  additional expenses and uncertainties resulting from the rapid wind down of the infrastructure that was developed to provide administrative support to over towing service locations 
although we believe that we can manage the wind down effectively  there can be no assurance that such will be the case 
even if we are able to manage the wind down effectively  it may nevertheless have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  we have experienced difficulty in maintaining our insurance and surety bond coverage primarily as a result of disruption in these markets resulting from the events of september   general economic conditions and our operating results 
we have experienced certain difficulties and unexpected expenses  and may continue to do so  related to entering into new lines of business 
historically  our expertise has been in the manufacture of towing and recovery equipment and we had no prior operating experience in other lines of business prior to commencing during fiscal  we entered three new lines of business through the acquisition of towing and recovery equipment distributors and towing services companies  and the establishment of our financial services group 
our operation of these businesses has been subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
such acquisitions presented the additional risk that newly acquired businesses could be viewed as being in competition with our other customers 
although the new businesses are closely related to our towing and recovery equipment manufacturing business  we experienced difficulties and unexpected expenses establishing and operating these new businesses  and may continue to experience such difficulties and expenses as we wind down the towing services segment and the distribution group 
our business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry  general economic conditions and weather 
adverse changes with respect to any of these factors may lead to a downturn in our business 
the towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature and has been affected historically by high interest rates  insurance costs  and economic conditions in general 
accordingly  a downturn in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operations  as has been the case during the current general economic downturn 
the industry is also influenced by consumer confidence and general credit availability  and by weather conditions  none of which is within our control 
our dependence upon outside suppliers for our raw materials and other purchased component parts  leaves us subject to price increases and delays in receiving supplies of such materials or parts 
we are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts and  therefore  are subject to price increases and delays in receiving supplies of such materials and component parts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass any price increase on to our customers 
although we believe that sources of our materials and component parts will continue to be adequate to meet our requirements and that alternative sources are available  events beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the cost or availability of such materials and component parts 
additionally  demand for our products could be negatively affected by the unavailability of truck chassis  which are manufactured by third parties and are typically purchased separately by our distributors or by towing operators and are sometimes supplied by us 
our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers  or attract current customers away from us 
the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
competition for sales exists at both the distributor and towing operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation  reputation  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
in addition  sales of our products are affected by the market for used towing and recovery equipment 
certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us 
we may also face significant competition from large competitors as we enter other new lines of business  including financial services 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technology 
historically  we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition 
certain of our patents expire in at which time we may not have a continuing competitive advantage through proprietary products and technology 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered into in with the antitrust division of the us department of justice  we are required to offer non exclusive royalty bearing licenses to certain of our key patents to all wrecker and car carrier manufacturers 
our historical market position has been a result  in part  of our continuous efforts to develop new products 
our future success and ability to maintain market share will depend  to an extent  on new product development 
we depend upon skilled labor to manufacture our products 
if we experience problems hiring and retaining skilled labor  our business may be negatively affected 
the timely production of our wreckers and car carriers requires an adequate supply of skilled labor 
in addition  the operating costs of each manufacturing facility can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions 
accordingly  our ability to increase sales  productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities 
the united auto workers union filed a representation petition with the national labor relations board for the employees at our ooltewah  tennessee manufacturing plant 
a vote was held on such union representation on april  the employees of the ooltewah manufacturing plant voted against joining the united auto workers union 
there can be no assurance that the employees at the ooltewah manufacturing plant or other of our employees may not choose to become unionized in the future 
if our common stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange the market for our common stock may be substantially less active and it may impair the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our common stock 
to remain listed on the new york stock exchange  the average closing price of our stock must not drop below per share for days or more 
our common stock price was below per share for an extended period during and the common stock was in danger of being delisted 
a one for five reverse stock split was effected on october   and the price of the common stock has not been below since that time 
we received notification from the new york stock exchange on june  that  based on market information and information in our recent public filings  we were not in compliance with the new york stock exchange s continued listing standards 
the new york stock exchange requires shareholders equity of not less than million and a day average market capitalization of million 
our shareholders equity was million as of december  as of march   we had a day average market capitalization of million 
we have compiled a three pronged plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards 
our plan is to restructure our bank facilities and rationalize the timing of our debt service  dispose of our remaining roadone and distributor operations within the time period specified and focus all of our resources  manpower as well as financial  on returning the manufacturing operations to their historically profitable levels 
in september  we were notified that the new york stock exchange accepted our plan to regain compliance with the new york stock exchange continued listing standards related to shareholders equity and market capitalization within an eighteen month timeframe 
with the approval by shareholders of the conversion of a portion of our subordinated debt into our common stock  we have completed the restructuring of our facilities 
we have also disposed of the remainder of our roadone operations and are in the process of disposing of our distributors 
during this timeframe  we will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance by the new york stock exchange 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the new york stock exchange  it is likely that the trading market for our common stock would be substantially less active  and the ability of shareholders to buy and sell shares of our common stock would be materially impaired 
in addition  the delisting of our stock could adversely affect our ability to enter into future equity financing transactions 
in the event that our stock is delisted from the new york stock exchange  we would pursue listing on an alternative national securities exchange or association 
any loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team 
the loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or an inability to acquire insurance at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
we are subject to various claims  including automobile and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business  and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience 
a successful product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage or the inability of us to acquire insurance at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
a continued increase in insurance and fuel costs will have a material effect upon our business 
as a result of the events of september  and other general economic factors  we have experienced a substantial increase in our insurance costs and have experienced fluctuations in fuel and other transportation costs 
our customers have also experienced reduced availability of credit for purchasing equipment 
there can be no assurance that these costs will not continue to increase for us 
such increases have had  and may continue to have  a material effect upon our business and operating results 
our stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market 
from time to time  there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common sock 
our quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimated by analysts  changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
our chairman and co chief executive officer owns a substantial interest in our common stock 
he may vote his shares in ways with which you disagree 
william g 
miller  our chairman  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  mr 
miller has the ability to exert significant influence over our business affairs  including the ability to influence the election of directors and the result of voting on all matters requiring shareholder approval 
our charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price 
our charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us  including  without limitation  prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements respecting amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws 
in addition  our charter authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
the rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors  in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval  and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
towing and recovery equipment we offer a broad range of towing and recovery equipment products that meet most customer design  capacity and cost requirements 
we manufacture the bodies of wreckers and car carriers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties 
wreckers generally are used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with rotating hydraulic booms and ton lifting capacities 
car carriers are specialized flat bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport 
car carriers transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective over longer distances 
our products are sold primarily through independent distributors that serve all states  canada and mexico  and other foreign markets including europe  the pacific rim and the middle east 
as a result of our ownership of jige in france and boniface in the united kingdom  we have substantial distribution capabilities in europe 
while most of our distributor agreements do not contain exclusivity provisions  management believes that approximately of our independent distributors sell our products on an exclusive basis 
in addition to selling our products to towing operators  the distributors provide parts and service 
we also have independent sales representatives that exclusively market our products and provide expertise and sales assistance to distributors 
management believes the strength of our distribution network and the breadth of our product offerings are two key advantages over our competitors 
product line we manufacture a broad line of wrecker  car carrier and trailer bodies to meet a full range of customer design  capacity and cost requirements 
the products are marketed under the century  vulcan  challenger  holmes  champion  chevron  eagle  titan  jige  and boniface brand names 
wreckers 
wreckers are generally used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with ton lifting capacities 
wreckers are available with specialized features  including underlifts  l arms and scoops  which lift disabled vehicles by the tires or front axle to minimize front end damage to the towed vehicles 
certain heavy duty wrecker models offer rotating booms  which allow heavy duty wreckers to recover vehicles from any angle  and proprietary remote control devices for operating wreckers 
in addition  certain light duty wreckers are equipped with the patented express automatic wheellift hookup device that allow operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the wrecker 
our wreckers range in capacity from to tons  and are characterized as light duty and heavy duty  with wreckers of ton or greater capacity being classified as heavy duty 
light duty wreckers are used to remove vehicles from accident scenes and vehicles illegally parked  abandoned or disabled  and for general recovery 
heavy duty wreckers are used in commercial towing and recovery applications including overturned tractor trailers  buses  motor homes and other vehicles 
car carriers 
car carriers are specialized flat bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport 
car carriers are used to transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective for transporting vehicles or other equipment over longer distances 
in addition to transporting vehicles  car carriers may also be used for other purposes  including transportation of industrial equipment 
in recent years  professional towing operators have added car carriers to their fleets to complement their towing capabilities 
multi vehicle transport trailers 
multi vehicle transport trailers are specialized auto transport trailers with upper and lower decks and hydraulic ramps for loading vehicles 
the trailers are used for moving multiple vehicles for auto auctions  car dealerships  leasing companies  and other similar applications 
the trailers are easy to load with to vehicles  and with the optional cab rack  can haul up to vehicles 
the vehicles can be secured to the transport quickly with ratchet and chain tie downs that are mounted throughout the frame of the transport 
in recent years  professional towing operators have added auto transport trailers to their fleets to add to their towing capabilities 
brand names we manufacture and market our wreckers  car carriers and trailers under ten separate brand names 
although certain of the brands overlap in terms of features  prices and distributors  each brand has its own distinctive image and customer base 
century 
the century brand is our top of the line brand and represents what management believes to be the broadest product line in the industry 
the century line was started in and produces wreckers ranging from the ton light duty to the ton heavy duty models and car carriers in lengths from to feet 
management believes that the century brand has a reputation as the industry s leading product innovator 
vulcan 
our vulcan product line includes a range of premium light and heavy duty wreckers  car carriers and other towing and recovery equipment 
the vulcan line is operated autonomously with its own independent distribution network 
challenger 
our challenger products compete with the century and vulcan products and constitute a third premium product line 
challenger products consist of light to heavy duty wreckers with capacities ranging from to tons  and car carriers with lengths ranging from to feet 
the challenger line was started in and is known for high performance heavy duty wreckers and aesthetic design 
holmes

the holmes wrecker was first produced in the holmes name has been the most well recognized and leading industry brand both domestically and internationally through most of this century 
champion 
the champion brand  which was introduced in  includes car carriers which range in length from to feet 
the champion product line  which is generally lower priced  allows us to offer a full line of car carriers at various competitive price points 
in  the champion line was expanded to include a line of economy tow trucks with integrated boom and underlift 
chevron 
our chevron product line is comprised primarily of premium car carriers 
chevron produces a range of premium single car  multi car and industrial carriers  light duty wreckers and other towing and recovery equipment 
the chevron line is operated autonomously with its own independent distribution network that focuses on the salvage industry 
eagle 
our eagle products consist of light duty wreckers with the eagle claw hook up system that allows towing operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the tow truck 
the eagle claw hook up system  which was patented in  was originally developed for the repossession market 
since acquiring eagle  we have upgraded the quality and features of the eagle product line and expanded its recovery capability 
titan 
our titan product line is comprised of premium multi vehicle transport trailers which can transport up to vehicles depending on configuration 
jige 
our jige product line is comprised of a broad line of light and heavy duty wreckers and car carriers marketed primarily in europe 
jige is a market leader best known for its innovative designs of car carriers and light wreckers necessary to operate within the narrow confines of european cities 
boniface 
our boniface product line is comprised primarily of heavy duty wreckers marketed primarily in europe 
boniface produces a wide range of heavy duty wreckers specializing in the long underlift technology required to tow modern european tour buses 
our holmes and century brand names are associated with four of the major innovations in the industry the rapid reverse winch  the tow sling  the hydraulic lifting mechanism  and the underlift with parallel linkage and l arms 
our engineering staff  in consultation with manufacturing personnel  uses computer aided design and stress analysis systems to test new product designs and to integrate various product improvements 
in addition to offering product innovations  we focus on developing or licensing new technology for our products 
manufacturing process we manufacture wreckers  car carriers and trailers at six manufacturing facilities located in the united states  france and england 
the manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of cutting and bending sheet steel or aluminum into parts that are welded together to form the wrecker  car carrier body or trailer 
components such as hydraulic cylinders  winches  valves and pumps  which are purchased by us from third party suppliers  are then attached to the frame to form the completed wrecker or car carrier body 
the completed body is either installed by us or shipped by common carrier to a distributor where it is then installed on a truck chassis 
generally  the wrecker or car carrier bodies are painted by us with a primer coat only  so that towing operators can select customized colors to coordinate with chassis colors or fleet colors 
to the extent final painting is required before delivery  we contract with independent paint shops for such services 
we purchase raw materials and component parts from a number of sources 
although we have no long term supply contracts  management believes we have good relationships with our primary suppliers 
we have experienced no significant problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules 
management believes that the materials used in the production of our products are available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers 
accordingly  management does not believe that the loss of a single supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business 
towing and recovery equipment sales and distribution company owned distributors during  our board of directors and management made the decision to sell our distributors 
our distribution group as of december  owned eight towing and recovery equipment distributors located in california  colorado  florida  illinois  indiana and british columbia and ontario  canada and had sold one distributor 
we intend to sell all of our distributors as quickly as possible 
all assets  liabilities and results of operations of the distribution group are now presented separately as discontinued operations and all prior period financial information is presented to conform to this treatment 
independent distributors and sales management categorizes the towing and recovery market into three general product types light duty wreckers  heavy duty wreckers and car carriers 
the light duty wrecker market consists primarily of professional wrecker operators  repossession towing services  municipal and federal governmental agencies  and repair shop or salvage company owners 
the heavy duty market is dominated by professional wrecker operators serving the needs of commercial vehicle operators 
the car carrier market  historically dominated by automobile salvage companies  has expanded to include equipment rental companies that offer delivery service and professional towing operators who desire to complement their existing towing capabilities 
management estimates that there are approximately  professional towing operators and  service station  repair shop and salvage operators comprising the overall towing and recovery market 
our sales force  which services our distribution network  consists of sales representatives whose responsibilities include providing administrative and sales support to the entire distributor base 
sales representatives receive commissions on direct sales based on product type and brand and generally are assigned specific territories in which to promote sales of our products and to maintain customer relationships 
we have developed a diverse customer base consisting of approximately distributors in north america  who serve all states  canada and mexico  and approximately distributors that serve other foreign markets 
during the year ended december   no single distributor accounted for more than of our sales 
management believes our broad and diverse customer base provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market changes  lessens our dependence on particular distributors and reduces the impact of regional economic factors 
to support sales and marketing efforts  we produce demonstrator models that are used by our sales representatives and distributors 
to increase exposure to our products  we also have served as the official recovery team for many automobile racing events  including the daytona  talladega  atlanta and darlington nascar races  the grand prix in miami  the suzuka in japan  the imsa hours at daytona  molson indy  the brickyard  and the indy races  among others 
we routinely respond to requests for proposals or bid invitations in consultation with our local distributors 
our products have been selected by the united states general services administration as an approved source for certain federal and defense agencies 
we intend to continue to pursue government contracting opportunities 
the towing and recovery equipment industry places heavy marketing emphasis on product exhibitions at national and regional trade shows 
in order to focus our marketing efforts and to control marketing costs  we have reduced our participation in regional trade shows and now concentrate our efforts on five of the major trade shows each year 
we work with our distributor network to concentrate on various regional shows 
product warranties and insurance we offer a month limited manufacturer s product and service warranty on our wrecker and car carrier products 
our warranty generally provides for repair or replacement of failed parts or components 
warranty service is usually performed by us or an authorized distributor 
management believes that we maintain adequate general liability and product liability insurance 
backlog we produce virtually all of our products to order 
our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that we believe are firm 
the level of backlog at any particular time  however  is not an appropriate indicator of our future operating performance 
certain purchase orders are subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification 
given our production and delivery schedules management believes that the current backlog represents less than three months of production 
competition the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive for sales to distributors and towing operators 
management believes that competition in the towing and recovery equipment industry is a function of product quality and innovation  reputation  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
we compete on the basis of each of these criteria  with an emphasis on product quality and innovation and customer service 
management also believes that a manufacturer s relationship with distributors is a key component of success in the industry 
accordingly  we have invested substantial resources and management time in building and maintaining strong relationships with distributors 
management also believes that our products are regarded as high quality within their particular price points 
our marketing strategy is to continue to compete primarily on the basis of quality and reputation rather than solely on the basis of price  and to continue to target the growing group of professional towing operators who as end users recognize the quality of our products 
traditionally  the capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low 
management believes a manufacturer s capital resources and access to technological improvements have become a more integral component of success in recent years 
accordingly  management believes that our ownership of patents on certain of the industry s leading technologies has given us a competitive advantage 
certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than we do 
employees as of december   we employed approximately people in our towing and recovery equipment manufacturing and distribution operations 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  though our employees in france and england have certain similar rights provided by their respective government s employment regulations 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
towing services roadone in february  we formed our towing services division  roadone  to build a national towing services network 
during april  we announced plans to accelerate our efforts to aggressively reduce expenses in the towing services segment at the corporate level  as well as in the field 
during the quarter ended june   our management and board of directors approved a plan to dispose of certain identified assets  which primarily consisted of underperforming markets of the towing services segment 
in october  we made the decision to sell all remaining towing services operations 
as of december  all of the towing services markets had either been sold or closed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we began reporting the entire towing services segment as discontinued operations as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of accordingly  the depreciation of fixed assets ceased on october  as of such date  all assets  liabilities  and results of operations are separately presented as discontinued operations and all prior period financial information is presented to conform with this treatment 
employees as of december   the few roadone employees that remained had been transferred to our towing and recovery equipment operations 
patents and trademarks the development of the underlift parallel linkage and l arms in is considered one of the most innovative developments in the wrecker industry in the last years 
this technology is significant primarily because it allows the damage free towing of newer aerodynamic vehicles made of lighter weight materials 
patents for this technology were granted to an operating subsidiary in and these patents expire in mid year this technology  particularly the l arms  is used in a majority of the commercial wreckers today 
management believes that utilization of such devices without a license is an infringement of our patents 
we have successfully litigated infringement lawsuits in which the validity of our patents on this technology was upheld  and successfully settled other lawsuits 
we also hold a number of other utility and design patents covering other products  the vulcan scoop wheel retainer and the car carrier anti tilt device 
we have also obtained the rights to use and develop certain technologies owned or patented by others 
pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered into in with the antitrust division of the us department of justice  we are required to offer non exclusive royalty bearing licenses to certain of our key patents to all tow truck and car carrier manufacturers 
our trademarks century  holmes  champion  challenger  formula i  eagle claw self loading wheellift  pro star  street runner  vulcan  roadone  right approach and extreme angle  among others  are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
management believes that our trademarks are well recognized by dealers  distributors and end users in their respective markets and are associated with a high level of quality and value 
government regulations and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
the costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past and is not expected to have a material adverse impact in the future 
we are also subject to the magnuson moss warranty federal trade commission improvement act which regulates the description of warranties on products 
the description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of vehicle components 
management believes that continued compliance with various government regulations will not materially affect our operations 
the financial services group is subject to regulation under various federal  state and local laws which limit the interest rates  fees and other charges that may be charged by it or prescribe certain other terms of the financing documents that it enters into with its customers 
management believes that the additional administrative costs of complying with these regulations will not materially affect our operations 
item properties we operate four manufacturing facilities in the united states 
the facilities are located in ooltewah  tennessee  hermitage  pennsylvania  mercer  pennsylvania  and greeneville  tennessee 
the ooltewah plant  containing approximately  square feet  produces light and heavy duty wreckers  the hermitage plant  containing approximately  square feet  produces car carriers  the mercer plant  which was acquired in december  containing approximately  square feet  produces car carriers and light duty wreckers  and the greeneville plant  containing approximately  square feet  primarily produces car carriers and trailers 
we operate two foreign manufacturing facilities located in the lorraine region of france  which contain  in the aggregate  approximately  square feet  and one in norfolk  england  which contains approximately  square feet 
we believe that our existing manufacturing facilities will allow us to meet anticipated demand for our products 
item legal proceedings we are  from time to time  a party to litigation arising in the normal course of our business 
litigation is subject to various inherent uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters could be resolved unfavorably to us  which could result in substantial damages against us 
we have established accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable and maintain product liability and other insurance that management believes to be adequate 
management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in excess of available insurance coverage and accruals will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders of the registrant during the last three months of the period covered by this annual report 
part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol mlr

general going concern 
our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
subsequent to december   we were in default of certain covenants under our senior and junior credit facility agreements  and our junior credit facility matured on july  the senior and junior credit facility agreements contain certain cross default provisions and provide for acceleration of amounts due as well as other remedies in the event of default 
these circumstances raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern without refinancing such credit facilities 
since the issuance of the going concern opinion  we have restructured both our junior and senior credit facilities 
the junior credit facility now matures on july  all defaults under both facilities have been waived 
new york stock exchange listing standards 
we received notification from the new york stock exchange on june  that  based on market information and information in our recent public filings  we were not in compliance with the new york stock exchange s continued listing standards 
the new york stock exchange requires shareholders equity of not less than million and a day average market capitalization of million 
our shareholders equity was million  as of june   million as of september   and million as of december  as of march   we had a day average market capitalization of million 
we compiled a three pronged plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards 
our plan is to restructure our bank facilities and rationalize the timing of our debt service  dispose of our remaining roadone and distributor operations within the time period specified and focus all of our resources  manpower as well as financial  on returning the manufacturing operations to their historically profitable levels 
in september  we were notified that the new york stock exchange accepted our plan to regain compliance with the new york stock exchange continued listing standards related to shareholders equity and market capitalization within an eighteen month timeframe 
with the approval by shareholders of the conversion of a portion of our subordinated debt into our common stock  we have completed the restructuring of our facilities 
we have also disposed of the remainder of our roadone operations and are in the process of disposing of our distributors 
during this timeframe  we will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance by the new york stock exchange 
discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   our management and board of directors made the decision to divest the remaining towing services segment  as well as the operations of the distribution group of the towing and recovery equipment segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets of the towing services segment and the distribution group are considered a disposal group and the assets are no longer being depreciated 
all assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with these assets have been separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the statements of operations and related financial statement disclosures for all prior years have been restated to present the towing services segment and the distribution group as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations 
the analyses contained herein are of continuing operations  as restated  unless otherwise noted 
the results of operations and loss on disposal associated with certain towing services markets  which were sold in june have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations given our significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposal components via a consulting agreement and our ongoing interest in the cash flows of the operations of the disposal components via a long term license agreement 
income taxes 
differences between the effective tax rate and the expected tax rate are due primarily to non deductible goodwill amortization and impairment charges for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
a discussion of critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows accounts receivable 
we extend credit to customers in the normal course of business 
collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
when a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long lived assets and goodwill may not be fully recovered  the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management  or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations 
the estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue  operating costs  interest rates  property and equipment additions  and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations 
upon adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
for further detail of our impairment review and related write downs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
warranty reserves 
we estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
we review trends of warranty claims and takes actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
we believe the warranty reserve is adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider tax loss carrybacks  reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning and estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we established a deferred tax valuation allowance of million as of december   representing a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets from continuing and discontinuing operations 
the allowance reflects our recognition that continuing losses from operations and certain liquidity matters associated with our credit facility indicate that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will not be realized through future taxable income 
the balance of the valuation allowance was million at december  revenues 
under our accounting policies  sales are recorded when equipment is shipped to independent distributors or other customers 
while we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties  we sometimes purchases the truck chassis for resale to our customers 
sales of company purchased truck chassis are included in net sales 
margins are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal 
revenue from our owned distributors is recorded at the time equipment is shipped to customers or services are rendered 
the towing services division recognizes revenue at the time services are performed 
seasonality 
our towing and recovery equipment segment has experienced some seasonality in net sales due in part to decisions by purchasers of light duty wreckers to defer wrecker purchases near the end of the chassis model year 
the segment s net sales have historically been seasonally impacted due in part to sales made at the largest towing and recovery equipment trade show which is held in the spring 
change in fiscal year 
on september   we announced that our board of directors had approved a change in our fiscal year  from april to december  effective december  the change to a december fiscal year will enable us to report results on a conventional calendar basis 
as a result of the change in fiscal year  we filed a transition report for the eight month period ended december   and the comparative data below compares the financial results for that period against the results for the fiscal year ended april  the periods are not directly comparable  in that they relate to periods of materially different lengths  and also that the transition period does not include results from the three months ended april  a fiscal quarter in which our sales have traditionally been seasonally higher than other quarters 
recent developments on january   we completed the exchange of certain of our subordinated debt and warrants held by contrarian funds  llc for shares of our common stock 
we also completed the exchange of subordinated debt and warrants held by harbourside investments  lllp  subject to shareholder approval at a shareholder meeting  which was held on february  harbourside s partners include several of our executive officers and directors  including our chairman and co chief executive officer  william g

in addition  the war in iraq at the beginning of the year had a negative impact on revenues of continuing operations 
costs of operations as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to the fixed cost impact of lower sales volume for domestic manufacturing operations 
selling  general  and administrative expenses changed slightly as a percentage of net sales from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december   reflecting the company s ongoing focus to control costs of continuing operations while disposing of towing services segment and distribution group

in july  we entered into a new four year senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders to replace our then existing credit facility 
as a part of this agreement  the previous credit facility was reduced with proceeds from the senior credit facility and amended to provide for a million subordinated secured facility 
the senior credit facility originally consisted of an aggregate million revolving credit facility and an million term loan 
the senior credit facility has been amended several times  including most recently on december  in connection with the restructuring of our senior and junior debt obligations 
as amended  the senior credit facility consists of an aggregate million credit facility  including a million revolving loan  a million term loan and a million term loan 
borrowing availability under the revolving senior credit facility is based on a percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable determined on eligibility criteria set forth in the credit facility and subject to a maximum borrowing limitation 
borrowings under the term loans are collateralized by substantially all of our property  plant  and equipment 
we are required to make monthly amortization payments on the first term loan of  but the amortization payments due on november   december   and january  were deferred until the maturity date 
the senior credit facility bears interest at the prime rate as defined plus  subject to the rights of the senior lender agent or a majority of the lenders to charge a default rate equal to the prime rate as defined plus during the continuance of any event of default under the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility matures on july  the senior credit facility contains requirements related to maintaining minimum excess availability at all times and minimum quarterly levels of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined and a minimum quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio as defined 
in addition  the senior credit facility contains restrictions on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets 
the senior credit facility also contains requirements related to weekly and monthly collateral reporting 
junior credit facility 
the million junior credit facility is by its terms expressly subordinated only to the senior credit facility 
the junior credit facility is secured by certain specified assets and by a second priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our other assets 
the junior credit facility contains requirements for certain fees to be paid at six month intervals beginning in january based on the outstanding balance of the facility at the time 
the junior credit facility also contains provisions for the issuance of warrants for of the outstanding shares of our common stock  shares in july and an additional  shares on july  with an exercise price equal to the then fair market value of our common stock 
as amended  the junior credit facility contains requirements for the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
it also imposes restrictions on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets

as amended  the junior credit facility  under which million in principal was outstanding at february   matures on july  and bears interest at an effective blended rate of 
restructuring of credit facilities 
our failure to repay all outstanding principal  interest and any other amounts due and owing under the junior credit facility at its original july  maturity date constituted an event of default under the junior credit facility and also triggered an event of default under the senior credit facility cross default provisions 
additionally  we were in default of the ebitda covenant under the junior credit facility only for the first quarter of calendar we were also in default under both the senior and junior credit facility as a result of the going concern explanatory paragraph included in the auditors report as well as the failure to file our annual report for the fiscal year ended december  prior to april  pursuant to the terms of the intercreditor agreement between the senior and junior lenders  the junior lender agent and the junior lenders were prevented from taking any enforcement action or exercising any remedies against us  our subsidiaries or our respective assets as a result of such events of default during a standstill period 
on july   the junior lender agent gave a notice of enforcement to the senior lender agent based upon the event of default for failure to repay the outstanding obligations under the junior credit facility on the junior credit facility s maturity date 
on august   the senior agent gave a payment blockage notice to the junior agent based upon certain events of default under the senior credit facility  thereby preventing the junior agent and junior lenders from receiving any payments from us in respect of the junior credit facility 
on october   we entered into a forbearance agreement with the lenders and the senior lender agent under the senior credit facility  pursuant to which  among other things  the senior lenders agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies in respect of the defaults then existing under the senior credit facility as a result of i the failure to timely deliver financial statements for fiscal year and the failure to deliver a report of our independent certified public accountants which is unqualified in any respect  as well as the event of default under the senior credit facility caused by the event of default arising from such failure under the junior credit facility  ii the failure to fulfill certain payment obligations to the junior lenders under the junior credit facility  and iii the failure to fulfill certain financial covenants in the junior credit facility for one or more of the fiscal quarters ending in fiscal year  which failure would constitute an event of default under the senior credit facility 
the forbearance period under the forbearance agreement was to expire on the earlier of x december   y the occurrence of certain bankruptcy type events in respect of us or any of our subsidiaries  and z the failure by us or any of our subsidiaries that are borrower parties under the senior credit facility to perform our obligations under the senior credit facility or the forbearance agreement 
under the forbearance agreement  the senior lenders and the senior lender agent did not waive their rights and remedies with respect to the existing senior facility defaults  but agreed to forbear from exercising rights and remedies with respect to the existing senior facility defaults solely during the forbearance period 
simultaneous with entering into the forbearance agreement on october   william g 
miller  the chairman of the board and co ceo of the company  made a million loan to us as a part of the senior credit facility 
the loan to us and mr 
miller s participation in the senior credit facility were effected by the seventh amendment to the credit agreement and a participation agreement between mr 
miller and the senior credit facility lenders 
on december   mr 
miller increased his previous million participation in the existing senior credit facility by an additional million 
these funds  along with additional funds from the cit group business credit  inc  were used to satisfy our obligations to two of our existing senior lenders with the result being that cit  an existing senior lender  and mr 
miller constituted our senior lenders  with cit holding of such loan and mr 
miller participating in of the loan 
mr 
miller s portion of the loan is subordinated to that of cit 
in conjunction with mr 
miller s increased participation  the senior credit facility was restructured and restated as a million revolving facility and million and million term loans 
as a result of this restructuring  all previously existing defaults under the senior credit facility were waived  the interest rate was lowered by to reflect a non default rate  fees attributable to roadone of  per month were eliminated  the financial covenants were substantially relaxed  and availability under the facility was increased by approximately million 
the senior lending group  consisting of cit and mr 
miller  earned fees of  in connection with the restructuring  including previously unpaid fees of  for the earlier forbearance agreement through december  and  for the restructuring of the loans described above 
of these fees   were paid to mr 
miller and the remainder  were paid to cit 
in addition  we will pay additional interest at a rate of on mr 
miller s portion of the loan  which is in recognition of the fact that mr 
miller s rights to payments and collateral are subordinate to those of cit 
this transaction was approved by the special committee of the board  as well as the full board of directors with mr 
miller abstaining due to his personal interest in the transaction 
in order to enter into this restructuring of the senior credit facility  cit required that the junior lenders agree to extend the standstill and payment blockage periods  which were to expire at the end of april  until july   which is after the july  maturity of the senior debt 
the junior facility lenders were unwilling to extend such standstill and payment blockage dates without the conversion provisions described above having been committed to by us  subject only to shareholder approval of the conversion by harbourside 
as a result  the restructuring of the senior debt facility and the conversion and exchange of subordinated debt and warrants described above were cross conditioned upon each other and agreements effecting them were entered into simultaneously on december  to effectuate the conversion and exchange of the subordinated debt and warrants  we entered into a binding restructuring agreement with contrarian and harbourside on december  pursuant to this agreement  contrarian and harbourside agreed to an exchange transaction where they would extend the maturity date of of the outstanding principal amount of the junior debt  approximately million  convert the remaining of the outstanding principal  plus all accrued interest and fees  into our common stock and convert the warrants into our common stock 
this agreement contemplated that the conversions would be further documented in separate exchange agreements and also contemplated registration rights agreements 
the binding restructuring agreement also outlined the terms for amending the junior credit facility to extend its maturity date to july  which is after the july  maturity date of the senior credit facility  to provide for an interest rate on the remaining debt of contrarian at and the remaining debt of harbourside at a reduced rate which was ultimately agreed to be  to provide for financial covenants that match those of the senior credit facility and to make other amendments to the junior credit facility consistent with amendments made to the senior credit facility as it was amended on december  the disparity in the interest rates to be earned by contrarian and harbourside is caused by contrarian negotiating an interest rate of as a condition to it entering into the binding restructuring agreement  as a result of which harbourside agreed to reduce the rate to be received by it to so that we would continue to pay an effective blended interest rate of on the aggregate of the subordinated debt following the exchange transactions 
at the same time  contrarian and harbourside entered into an agreement with our senior lenders to extend the maturity date of the subordinated debt that they would continue to hold 
as of january   we entered into separate exchange agreements with contrarian and harbourside  a registration rights agreement with contrarian and harbourside and an amendment to the junior credit facility with contrarian and harbourside  all as contemplated in the binding restructuring agreement 
additional details regarding the specific terms of the exchange agreements can be found under the heading recent developments and related party transactions 
under the amendment to the junior credit facility  the maturity of the remaining subordinated debt was extended and the interest rates thereon were altered and the financial covenants were amended to match those in its senior credit facility  which had been substantially relaxed in our favor on december  specifically  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant was amended to provide that we may not have a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of less than to for each four quarter period beginning with the four quarter period ending march  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated fixed charges 
in addition  the consolidated ebitda covenant was amended to provide that we must have consolidated ebitda for each trailing three month period ended as of the last day of each month  commencing on march   of at least million 
because of the amount of obligations outstanding under our credit facilities and the connection of the interest rate under each facility including the default rates to the prime rate  an increase in the prime rate could have a significant effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations under the credit facilities and increase our interest expense significantly 
therefore  our liquidity and access to capital resources could be further affected by increasing interest rates 
outstanding borrowings 
outstanding borrowings under the senior and junior credit facilities as of december  and as of december  were as follows in thousands december  december  senior credit facility manufacturing road one term loan total junior credit facility total outstanding borrowings these substantial reductions in the company s overall indebtedness were due to improved operating cash flow resulting from cost reductions and expense controls 
dispositions of roadone assets and operations improved liquidity and generated proceeds and reduced expenses  which were used to further reduce debt 
borrowings under the junior credit facility have been further reduced after december  as a result of our debt restructuring

in october  we obtained interest rate swaps as required by terms in our senior credit facility to hedge exposure to market fluctuations 
the interest rate swaps cover million in notional amounts of variable rate debt and with fixed rates ranging from to 
the swaps expire annually from october to october the hedges were deemed to be fully effective resulting in a pretax loss of  recorded in other comprehensive loss at december  upon expiration of these hedges  the amount recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings as interest 
in  the borrowing base was converted from libor to prime  which rendered the swap ineffective as a hedge 
accordingly  concurrent with the conversion we prematurely terminated the swap in february at a cost of  the resulting loss was recorded in other comprehensive loss at december  and reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the senior credit facility 
the junior credit facility contains provisions for the issuance of warrants of up to of the outstanding shares of our common stock on july and up to an additional in july the warrants were valued as of july based on the relative fair value using the black scholes model with the following assumptions risk free rate of estimated life of years  volatility and no dividend yield

item a 
financial statements and supplementary data we believe that our exposures to market risks are immaterial 
we hold no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  we do not employ any derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments to hedge any market risk  and we have no plans to do so in the future 
to the extent we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk because of the variable interest rate under the facility
