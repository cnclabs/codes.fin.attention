item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for purposes of this discussion and analysis section  reference is made to the table below and the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we have two principal operating groups maintenance products and electrical products 
the group labeled as other consists of a minority equity investment in a seafood harvesting and farming company  as well as the limited partnership interest sesco holds in the operator of a waste to energy facility 
two businesses formerly included in the electrical products group  gc waldom and hamilton  and one business formerly included in the maintenance products group  duckback  have been classified as discontinued operations 
duckback was sold on september   gc waldom was sold on april   and hamilton was sold on october  since the recapitalization as described in item on june   the company s management has been focused on the following initiatives o restructuring of core operations facilities closed or consolidated including to be closed by the end of 
o cost reductions central services model  sourcing in asia  product re engineering  headcount reductions  and improved management of raw material price exposure 
o balance sheet review in light of ongoing business profitability and requirements  approximately million of obsolete assets were impaired 
o divestitures of non core business businesses have been sold or otherwise exited and proceeds have been applied to reduce debt 
o re development of new product pipeline capital and management expertise has been re dedicated to this critical area 
o organizational changes across the board review of management talent and key hires made 
with these initiatives accomplished or well under way  the company s focus has shifted to revenue growth through a variety of means recent business wins include new product introductions  introduction of products to new distribution channels  and acquisitions 
our future cost reductions will come from process improvements such as lean manufacturing and six sigma  value engineering products  improved sourcing purchasing and lean administration 
key elements in achieving profitability in the maintenance products group include maintaining a low cost structure  both from a production and administrative standpoint  and providing outstanding customer service 
most of the maintenance products group products do not rely upon strong brand equity  so achieving and maintaining a position as a low cost producer is a necessity  given that our comparative price point on many products is below those of our competitors 
new product development is especially important in the consumer retail markets for maintenance products  as new products or beneficial modifications of existing products increase demand from our customers  provide novelty to the consumer  and offer an opportunity for favorable pricing from customers in the national mass market retail area 
retention of customers  or more specifically  product lines with those customers  is also very important in the mass market retail area  given the vast size of these national accounts 
prices for raw materials  especially plastic resins  have a very significant impact on the maintenance products group 
key elements in achieving profitability in the electrical products group are in many ways similar to those mentioned for our maintenance products group 
the achievement and maintenance of a low cost structure is critical given the significant level of foreign competition  primarily from asia and latin america 
for this reason  in december and december  woods and woods canada  respectively  ceased all manufacturing and initiated a fully outsourced strategy for their consumer electrical products 
customer service  specifically the ability to fill orders at a rate designated by our customers  is very important to customer retention  given seasonal sales pressures in the consumer electrical area 
retention of customers is critical in the electrical products group  given the size of national accounts

includes discontinued operations compared to company overview overall  net sales for the company declined million  or from levels  due to a volume decline of and lower pricing of  partially offset by favorable currency translation of 
gross margins held constant at approximately as the benefit of implemented cost reduction strategies offset lower pricing  higher resin costs and atypically high depreciation see discussion under maintenance products group operating income loss below 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the operating deficit was reduced significantly from million to million mostly as a result of reduced severance  restructuring and related charges and lower impairments of long lived assets 
excluding these charges  the company experienced operating profit of million during versus million in to provide transparency about measures of the company s performance  we supplement the reporting of our financial information under generally accepted accounting principles gaap with non gaap information on operating income loss excluding severance  restructuring and related charges and impairments of long lived assets 
we believe the use of this measure is a better indicator of the underlying operating performance of the company s businesses and allows us to make meaningful comparisons of different operating periods 
maintenance products group an overall decline in net sales for the year mostly due to volume declines along with high raw materials costs and atypically high depreciation contributed to the reduced profitability excluding severance  restructuring and related charges and impairments of long lived assets of this group in operating results continue to be favorably impacted by the numerous cost reduction initiatives including the consolidation of our facilities in the st 
louis area as well as the consolidation of two abrasives facilities into our wrens  georgia facility 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales were down from the fourth quarter of as compared to a decline for the first nine months of the year 
operating loss for the fourth quarter of was million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of severance  restructuring and related costs and impairments of long lived assets totaled million and million in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
excluding these costs  operating profit for the fourth quarter of increased over the same period last year 
net sales net sales from the maintenance products group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the decline was due to a volume decrease of  partially offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates of 
the sales shortfalls to the prior year were realized in the businesses that sell to both commercial and consumer customers 
on the commercial side  sales were lower at gemtex  primarily due to increased foreign competition  and at loren  primarily because a major customer increased their supplier base in in addition  we believe that the jan san business unit was impacted during the first three quarters of by the general economic conditions and reduced demand for cleaning products  due to commercial real estate vacancy rates and reduced demand in the travel and hospitality industries 
in the fourth quarter  sales for the jan san business unit were higher in than in representing an improvement in the health of the aforementioned industries 
sales were higher in the international markets for katy s commercial and sanitary maintenance products  primarily in the uk sales for the consumer business unit  which sells primarily to mass market retail customers  were lower due to the loss of certain product lines with major outlet customers and to a lesser extent  downward pricing pressures and allowance  rebate  and other programs 
the uk consumer plastics business benefited overall from stronger volumes and favorable exchange rates  partially offset by price erosion similar to that in the us business 
in addition to continually striving to reduce our cost structure  we are seeking to offset pricing challenges by developing new products for the retail markets 
the development of new products is essential to remaining competitive and to maintaining strong relationships with large national mass market retail customers 
in the fourth quarter of  we centralized our customer service and administrative functions for ccp divisions jan san  glit microtron  and wilen in one location  allowing customers to order products from any ccp division on one purchase order 
the customer service and administrative functions for disco  loren and ccp canada will be added during we believe that operating these businesses as a cohesive unit will improve customer service in that our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
this should also increase customer loyalty  help in attracting new customers and lead to increased top line sales in future years 
operating loss the group s operating loss improved by million from million in to million in  an improvement of 
the operating losses were primarily a result of costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments in both periods  which are discussed further below 
excluding those items  operating income decreased by million from million in to million in profitability was lower at ccp s metal truck box business  loren and gemtex  due to volume related issues  while the consumer business in the us and in the us was negatively impacted by top line pricing pressures and an unfavorable mix of lower margin products 
in addition  the consumer and jan san businesses worldwide experienced higher raw material costs principally resin in operating results were also negatively impacted by million of incremental depreciation related to the revision of the estimated useful lives of certain manufacturing assets  specifically molds and tooling equipment used in the manufacture of plastic products  from seven to five years  effective january  this change in estimate was made following significant impairments to these types of assets recorded during these shortfalls were partially offset by improved results at the ccp jan san business which benefited from the implementation of cost reduction strategies 
operating results in and were negatively impacted by several unusual charges 
in  the group incurred severance  restructuring and related charges of million 
the largest of these charges million relates principally to non cancelable leases at abandoned facilities as a result of the consolidation of the ccp facilities in the st 
louis area into ccp s largest and most modern plant in bridgeton  missouri 
the establishment of these liabilities involves estimates of future sub lease income  where we generally assumed that the amount of sub lease income on these facilities would increase over time 
adjustments to these liabilities are possible in the future depending upon the accuracy of sub lease assumptions made 
charges of million were also incurred in relating to the restructuring of the abrasives business  principally to consolidate the lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina facilities into the newly expanded wrens  georgia location 
the group also incurred charges in related to the consolidation of the customer service and administrative functions for ccp million  severance costs for headcount reductions million and costs related to the closure of ccp s metals facility in santa fe springs  california million 
during  the maintenance products group recorded million of severance  restructuring and related charges 
included in this amount was million related to the st 
louis facility consolidation mostly for non cancelable lease payments  million for severance costs related to various headcount reductions  including the management level of various business units  million in consulting fees associated with outsourcing strategies  relating mainly to the wilen business unit and million related to the consolidation of the customer service and administrative functions for ccp 
the group recorded impairments of long lived assets of million during and million during charges in included million related to idle and obsolete equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements at warson road  hazelwood  bridgeton  and the santa fe springs  california metals facility  million related to the closure of abrasives facilities in lawrence  massachusetts and pineville  north carolina and the subsequent consolidation into the wrens  georgia facility  and million of obsolete molds and tooling at our plastics facility in the united kingdom 
in addition  million of goodwill and patents of the gemtex business unit were impaired as it was determined that future cash flows of this business could not support the carrying value of its intangible assets 
the gemtex unit has experienced a decline in profitability in recent years principally as a result of increasing foreign competition 
in  certain ccp property  plant and equipment  primarily molds and tooling assets  were impaired by million  and a customer list intangible was impaired by million 
the majority of these impairments were associated with assets used in the consumer business  and were the result of analyses indicating insufficient future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets to cover the carrying values of the assets 
given the unique nature of molds for specific products  the fair values  if any  are often less than historical cost  resulting in impairments 
the wilen business unit recorded asset impairments of million  resulting from management decisions on the future use of certain manufacturing assets in the atlanta  georgia facility 
total assets for the group decreased primarily as a result of the impairments of million  and due to the atypically high depreciation expense related to the revision of lives of certain assets both noted above 
electrical products group the electrical products group continued its solid performance in  once again driven primarily by improved sales volume over  and secondarily  by higher margins over the prior year 
in addition  during and a major restructuring occurred within the electrical products group 
after significant study and research into different sourcing alternatives  we decided that woods and woods canada would source substantially all of their products from asia 
in december  woods shut down all us manufacturing facilities  which were in suburban indianapolis and in southern indiana 
as a result of these plant closures  employees were terminated 
in december  woods canada shut down its manufacturing facility in toronto  ontario  terminating employees in the process 
see below for a discussion of severance and restructuring costs and impairments recorded as a result of these facility closures 
net sales the electrical product group s sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
an increase in volume of and favorable currency translation of was partially offset by lower pricing of 
woods experienced year over year increase in volume as a result of a strong fourth quarter in the improvement was primarily due to higher volumes of direct import merchandise  which are shipped directly from our suppliers to our customers  such as extension cords and power strips 
woods sales performance in also benefited from the introduction of new surge products  sales to new customers and same store growth for its largest customer  a national mass market retailer 
offsetting these volume increases was a slight reduction in pricing which was implemented to remain competitive in certain product lines 
higher sales at woods canada in compared to were principally due to the impact of a stronger canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
this increase was offset partially by lower pricing mostly due to a shift during to direct import products 
operating income the group s operating income increased from million in to million in operating income in both years was reduced by costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding these costs  operating income increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
profitability in was positively impacted by cost reduction strategies at both woods and woods canada 
the most significant initiative benefiting was the closure of the woods manufacturing facility in december  resulting in approximately million in savings 
in december  woods canada shut down its manufacturing facility to pursue a fully outsourced product strategy similar to woods 
cost reduction initiatives at woods canada to reduce product and variable costs also had a favorable impact on higher sales volumes and favorable currency translation also aided in maintaining margins 
during  woods incurred a loss of million related to obsolete raw material and packaging inventory on hand which could not be utilized following the shutdown of the us manufacturing facilities see next paragraph 
operating results in and were negatively impacted by a number of restructuring related charges 
during  the group recognized million of severance  restructuring and related charges 
of this amount  million related to severance associated with the shutdown of the woods canada manufacturing operations  million at woods primarily for an adjustment to a non cancelable lease accrual due to a change in sub lease assumptions and million of consulting fees associated with product outsourcing strategies 
in  the electrical products group incurred consulting fees of million associated with product outsourcing strategies and charges related to the shut down of all us manufacturing operations and million for severance and other exit costs 
the group recorded impairments of million in both and associated with the write down of certain equipment at woods canada and woods as a result of the closure of the manufacturing operations at both business units 
we believe that restructuring steps executed in and related to the woods and woods canada businesses will allow those businesses to remain competitive within their markets 
the fully outsourced product strategy has reduced headcount at woods by employees effective in december and woods canada by employees effective in december 
total assets for the group increased primarily as a result of higher accounts receivable balances due to stronger sales at the end of versus the end of other sales from other operations decreased by million  as a result of the sesco waste to energy operation being turned over to a third party in april the operating loss from other operations in was primarily attributable to a charge of million  relating to an obligation created by katy to the third party who took over daily operation of the sesco facility 
amounts will be paid in roughly equal installments through see note to the consolidated financial statements for katy in part ii  item  for a discussion of the sesco partnership transaction 
discontinued operations three business units are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented hamilton precisions metals  lp hamilton  gc waldom electronics  inc gc waldom and duckback products  inc 
duckback 
hamilton generated million of operating income in prior to its sale on october  
gc waldom reported operating loss of million in prior to its sale on april   versus a million operating loss in nearly the entire operating loss of gc waldom in was the result of asset valuation adjustments in anticipation of a sale of the business unit 
a loss net of tax of million was recognized in the second quarter of as a result of the gc waldom sale 
duckback generated operating income of million in prior to its sale on september  versus million in a gain net of tax of million was recognized in the third quarter of as a result of the duckback sale 
corporate during  the corporate group recorded million of compensation expense versus an insignificant amount in associated with stock appreciation rights sars and million related to severance 
interest  net was million higher in as compared to during  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs due to the reduction in our borrowing capacity as a result of the refinancing of our debt obligations in february and due to the permanent reduction in term loan debt resulting from proceeds of the sale of gc waldom and duckback 
the amount of this write off is included in interest expense 
excluding the write off  interest  net decreased by million  or  due mainly to lower average borrowings during  principally as a result of applying proceeds from the sale of non core businesses in and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates contributed to the decline in interest expense 
other  net in included the write off of certain deferred payment receivables associated with businesses disposed of prior to million and realized foreign exchange losses million  offset partially by the net gain on the sale of real estate assets million 
other  net in was comprised primarily of realized foreign exchange losses million and the loss on the sale of assets million 
our effective tax rate in was  indicating that a million tax benefit was recorded on a million pretax loss from continuing operations 
a tax benefit was recorded on pre tax loss to the extent a provision was provided for the gain on sale of discontinued businesses and income from operations of discontinued businesses 
a further benefit was not recorded due to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
see deferred income taxes in critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  for further discussion of income tax accounting 
in  we recorded a million transitional goodwill impairment  net of tax as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 which is shown on the consolidated statements of operations as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a further discussion of goodwill impairments 
compared to maintenance products group the maintenance products group had a mixed year in operating income  excluding severance  restructuring  and impairment charges  was up over  as the various cost reduction programs put into place over the last two years began to impact results 
while the improvement in profitability was a positive step  significant improvement over was expected since was an especially weak year in the maintenance products group 
sales volumes were down overall from  with the largest decrease in the consumer business unit 
net sales sales from the maintenance products group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the largest sales decrease occurred within the consumer business  which sells primarily to mass market retail customers 
while certain product lines with retail customers remained stable  the revenue declines were caused by the loss of certain product lines  as well as selected price erosion with retail customers through allowance  rebate  and other pricing programs 
sales in the maintenance products divisions serving commercial markets primarily jan san were essentially flat versus glit microtron s abrasives business saw a significant increase in sales from  with sales increasing year over year for seven of their top ten customers 
glit microtron s sales increases included increases with several key  sizable  janitorial sanitation distributors 
glit microtron also grew its business with a large national retail chain  for which glit microtron supplies their full stock of floor cleaning abrasive pads for internal use at their stores nationwide 
sales were also higher in the international markets for katy s commercial and sanitary maintenance products  primarily in the uk and canada 
these positive sales trends were offset by lower sales at ccp s jan san business and at wilen 
the maintenance products group also made positive steps in toward managing the various janitorial sanitation supply divisions as one group  consolidating more of the customer service and administrative functions of these divisions in st 
louis 
operating loss the group s operating loss improved by million from million in to million in  an improvement of 
the operating loss was primarily a result of costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding those items  operating income improved by million from million in to million in the improvement in operating income was primarily driven by various ccp business units 
glit microtron s operating income improvement was driven by strong sales volume and cost reductions in numerous areas  including raw materials  freight  and headcount 
ccp s operating income improved mainly due to cost reductions implemented on a continuing basis throughout and the wilen business unit deteriorated during and due to operational problems that were largely remedied in in addition  significant new business was gained in early from a large national mass market retail store chain  who will use wilen mops for their in store floor care needs  providing meaningful levels of new sales to use capacity existing at the wilen plant 
during  the maintenance products group recorded significant valuation reserve adjustments associated with inventory and receivables  totaling million 
operating income improved by million during as a result of the cessation of goodwill amortization per the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
operating results in were negatively impacted by several unusual charges 
the group incurred severance and restructuring charges of million 
the largest of these charges was the establishment of million of liabilities for non cancelable lease payments at abandoned st 
louis facilities  the operations of which have been consolidated into ccp s largest and most modern plant in bridgeton  missouri 
charges of million were incurred in related to the movement of equipment and inventory from an abandoned facility  and severance payments of million were made to employees impacted by this move 
the maintenance products group incurred approximately million in consulting fees associated with outsourcing strategies  relating mainly to the wilen business unit 
while plans called for wilen to continue in a manufacturing capacity  the outsourcing project resulted in improved prices from some new vendors on products that had already been outsourced 
the group incurred million of severance costs related to various headcount reductions  primarily at the management level of operating divisions 
the maintenance products group also incurred million associated with transitioning administrative and accounting functions of wilen and glit microtron to st 
louis  missouri 
the maintenance products group recognized impairment charges on certain long lived assets totaling million in certain ccp property  plant and equipment  primarily molds and tooling assets  were impaired by million  and a customer list intangible was impaired by million 
the majority of these impairments was associated with assets used in the ccp consumer business  and was the result of analyses indicating insufficient future cash flows to cover the carrying values of the assets 
it was determined that portions of the carrying values of certain assets would not be recovered by future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets 
given the unique nature of molds for specific products  the fair values  if any  are often less than historical cost  resulting in impairments 
the wilen business unit recorded asset impairments of million  resulting from management decisions on the future use of certain manufacturing assets in the atlanta  georgia facility 
operating results in for the maintenance products group were also negatively impacted by several unusual charges 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at wilen as consistently poor operating performance led us to conclude that the carrying values of certain long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows 
in addition to the impairment at wilen  an additional million of impairment charges were taken  related primarily to management decisions regarding the discontinuance of certain property  plant and equipment 
additional items that negatively impacted operating results during include severance and restructuring charges of million  primarily at ccp and wilen 
total assets for the group decreased primarily as a result of the impairments noted above  and due to the fact that depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures for the group 
electrical products group the electrical products group had a positive year in  driven primarily by improved sales volume over  and secondarily  by higher margins over the prior year 
in addition  during a major restructuring occurred at the woods business 
after significant study and research into different sourcing alternatives  we decided that woods would source all of its products from asia 
in december  woods shut down all us manufacturing facilities  which were in suburban indianapolis and in southern indiana 
as a result of these plant closures  employees were terminated 
the following charges were recorded related to the shut down severance and other closure costs of million  asset impairments of million  and write off of excess raw material inventory on hand at the time of the shut down of million 
net sales the electrical products group s sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
higher sales volumes to the two largest customers of woods  both national mass market retailers  drove the sales increase 
sales to these two customers combined were up million  or  from higher volumes of direct import merchandise  which are shipped directly from our suppliers to our customers  such as extension cords and power strips  drove the higher sales to one of these customers 
the strong relationships with these large customers have provided a solid foundation for growth in the woods business 
woods canada also experienced a significant sales increase to its largest customer  also a large mass market retailer  to whom sales were higher by 
operating income loss the group s operating income increased from million in to million in operating income was reduced by costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding these costs  operating income increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
higher sales volumes aided in maintaining margins  and ongoing cost control has allowed woods and woods canada to reduce product and variable costs 
during  woods incurred a loss of million related to the write off of obsolete raw material and packaging inventory on hand which could not be utilized following the shutdown of the us manufacturing facilities see next paragraph 
significant factors impacting results include lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments totaling million  the largest of which related to the exit of certain licensed branded product lines by woods in the first quarter of woods had entered into several proprietary licensed branding agreements with several companies well known in the electronics and computer industries  but efforts to market the products proved unsuccessful 
woods also incurred a litigation loss reserve of million

other sales from other operations decreased by million  or  as a result of the sesco waste to energy facility operation being turned over to a third party in april  compared to a full year s sales in operating income from other operations in was driven by an unusual charge of million  relating to an obligation created by katy to the third party who took over daily operation of the sesco facility 
amounts will be paid in roughly equal installments through see note to the consolidated financial statements for katy in part ii  item  for a discussion of the sesco partnership transaction 
operating income in was impacted primarily by the million impairment of all of the long lived assets of the sesco operation 
the assets were written down in anticipation of a cash flow negative transaction that would be necessary for katy to exit the sesco business 
discontinued operations hamilton generated million of operating income in prior to its sale on october   versus operating income of million in hamilton s business was affected by general economic conditions and lower capital spending within the markets hamilton serves

included in this amount is approximately million of charges that relate to outside consultants working with katy to modify operating and financial strategies  and million of non cancelable rent and other exit costs associated with the premature termination of our leased office facility in englewood  colorado 
the largest portions of the million of costs associated with the recapitalization were non capitalizable legal fees and investment banker fees  board and committee fees and other internal incremental costs 
total assets at corporate decreased due to two primary items 
cash was lower by million due to more efficient management of borrowed funds at the end of versus and net deferred tax assets were lower by million as a result of an additional valuation allowance provided in interest was lower by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to significant reductions in outstanding debt balances due to the infusion of equity capital with the recapitalization on june   and reductions in debt as a result of working capital reductions in the last half of our effective tax rate in was  indicating that a million tax provision was recorded on a million pretax loss from continuing operations 
a net tax provision was recorded on the loss rather than a net tax benefit because we determined that a greater valuation allowance was required on our net deferred tax asset position 
the effective tax rate in  while resulting in book benefit on a pretax book loss  was only  due to a significant increase in valuation allowances on net operating loss deferred tax assets 
see deferred income taxes in critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  for further discussion of income tax accounting

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity was further improved in  with overall debt including the preferred interest in a subsidiary decreasing by million from million at the end of to million at the end of cash increased by million from million at the end of to million at the end of during  we accomplished the following o in february  we entered into a new credit agreement  agented by fleet capital fleet credit agreement  which replaced the credit agreement entered into at the time of the recapitalization in june of deutsche bank credit agreement 
the fleet credit agreement provides for million of borrowing capacity  including million of term debt and million of revolving debt  with a syndicate of banks  all of whom had participated in the deutsche bank credit agreement 
the fleet credit agreement is an asset based lending agreement which expires on january  o we were able to redeem at a discount the remaining preferred interest that the former owner of a subsidiary had held 
this balance sheet liability  which had a carrying value of million at december   was redeemed for million in february the gain on this redemption was added to stockholders equity  and had a favorable impact on earnings per share 
this redemption resulted in a reduction of preferred cash distributions by approximately million annually  which had accrued at an annual rate of 
after giving effect to the interest cost incurred by the company to fund the redemption  the net decrease in financing cost for the company is approximately million annually 
o we generated operating cash flow of million  despite million of payments to satisfy severance  restructuring and related liabilities

by the end of  we were turning our inventory at times per year versus times per year in the fleet credit agreement allows us to more efficiently leverage our entire asset base  and to create more borrowing room under our revolving credit facility  which is based on the liquidation values of accounts receivable and inventories 
the term loan is collateralized by real and personal property 
below is a summary of the sources and uses associated with the funding of the fleet credit agreement thousands of dollars sources term loan borrowings under the fleet credit agreement  revolving loan borrowings under the fleet credit agreement  uses payment of interest and principal under the deutsche bank credit agreement  purchase of outstanding preferred interest of a subsidiary at a discount  payment of accrued distributions on outstanding preferred interest of a subsidiary certain costs associated with the fleet credit agreement under the fleet credit agreement  the term loan originally had a final maturity date of february  and quarterly repayments of million  three of which were made on april  july and october   respectively 
however  the net proceeds received from the gc waldom and duckback sales see above  were used to prepay the term loan  which is now scheduled to be repaid in its entirety by early the revolving credit facility has an expiration date of january  unused borrowing availability on the revolving credit facility was million at february  our borrowing base under the fleet credit agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit 
vendors  financial institutions and other parties with whom we conduct business may require letters of credit in the future that either do not exist today or would be at higher amounts than those that exist today 
currently  our largest letters of credit relate to our casualty insurance programs

subsequent to june  and in accordance with the fleet credit agreement  katy s margins dropped an additional basis points from the pre june levels on both the revolving credit facility and the term loan based on the achievement of a financial covenant target 
during october  also in accordance with the fleet credit agreement  margins on the term borrowings dropped an additional basis points a the balance of the term loan was reduced below million as a result of the application of the proceeds from the duckback sale 
interest accrues at higher margins on prime rates for swing loans  the amounts of which were nominal at december  katy incurred million in debt issuance costs in associated with the fleet credit agreement 
additionally  at the time of the inception of the fleet credit agreement  katy had approximately million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the deutsche bank credit agreement 
based on the pro rata reduction in borrowing capacity from the deutsche bank credit agreement to the fleet credit agreement and in the connection with the sale of assets primarily the gc waldom and duckback businesses  katy charged to expense million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
the remainder of the previously capitalized costs  along with the capitalized costs from the fleet credit agreement is being amortized over the life of the fleet credit agreement through january the revolving credit facility under the fleet credit agreement requires lockbox agreements which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding 
these agreements  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the fleet credit agreement  causes the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  the company does not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a fairly typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox agreements and the mae clause 
the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of january  also  we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants at december  the lender had not notified us of any indication of a mae at december   and we were not in default of any provision of the fleet credit agreement at december  the fleet credit agreement  and the additional borrowing ability on revolving credit obtained by incurring new term debt  results in three important benefits related to the long term strategy of katy allowed us to redeem early at a discount a preferred interest obligation of a subsidiary  provides borrowing power to invest in capital expenditures key to our strategic direction  and provides working capital flexibility to build inventory when necessary to accommodate lower cost outsourced finished goods inventory 
we believe that our operations and the fleet credit agreement provide sufficient liquidity for our operations going forward 
funding for capital expenditures and working capital needs is expected to be accomplished through the use of available borrowings under the fleet credit agreement 
anticipated capital expenditures are expected to be slightly higher in than in  mainly due to additional investments planned for the development of new products 
restructuring and consolidation activities are important to reducing our cost structure to a competitive level 
we have a number of obligations and commitments  which are listed on the schedule later in this section entitled contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have considered all of these obligations and commitments in structuring our capital resources to ensure that they can be met 
see the notes accompanying the table in that section for further discussions of those items 
we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to divestitures of certain of our businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
in addition to the sale of the gc waldom and duckback businesses in for aggregate proceeds of million see above  we have sold additional assets in primarily excess real estate for proceeds of million 
the largest of these was the february  sale of the woods manufacturing facility in moorseville  indiana 
gross proceeds were million  of which million was used to repay a mortgage loan payable on the property 
the remainder of the proceeds reduced our debt obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a discussion of sesco 
contractual obligations we also enter into operating lease agreements in the ordinary course of business  and many of our facilities are leased 
contractual obligations associated with these leases are listed in the table under the following section entitled contractual obligations and commercial obligations

as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  sesco  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of katy  is party to a partnership that operates a waste to energy facility  and has certain contractual obligations  for which katy provides certain guarantees 
if the partnership is not able to perform its obligations under the contracts  under certain circumstances sesco and katy could be subject to damages equal to the amount of industrial revenue bonds outstanding which financed construction of the facility less amounts held by the partnership in debt service reserve funds 
katy and sesco do not anticipate non performance by parties to the contracts 

b 
amount owed to montenay as a result of the sesco partnership  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
million of this obligation is classified in the consolidated balance sheets as an accrued expense in current liabilities  while the remainder is included in other liabilities  recorded on a discounted basis 

c 
these obligations represent liabilities associated with restructuring activities  other than liabilities for non cancelable lease rentals 
future non cancelable lease rentals are included in the line entitled operating leases 
the consolidated balance sheet at december   includes million in discounted liabilities associated with non cancelable operating lease rentals  net of estimated sub lease revenues  related to facilities that have been abandoned as a result of restructuring and consolidation activities 

d 
as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section above  the entire revolving credit facility under the fleet credit agreement is classified as a current liability on the consolidated statements of financial position as a result of the combination in the fleet credit agreement of lockbox agreements on katy s depository bank accounts and a subjective material adverse effect mae clause 
other items effect of transactions with related and certain other parties in connection with the contico international  llc now ccp acquisition on january   we entered into building lease agreements with newcastle industries  inc newcastle 
lester miller  the former owner of ccp  and a katy director from to  is the majority owner of newcastle 
since the acquisition of ccp  several additional properties utilized by ccp are leased directly from lester miller 
rental expense for these properties approximates historical market rates 
related party rental expense for the years ended december    and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we paid newcastle million  million and million of preferred distributions for each of the years ended december   and  respectively  on the preferred units of ccp held by newcastle 
the decreases in distributions were due to the early redemptions at a discount of the preferred interest at the time of the recapitalization in june and in february which was the remainder of the preferred interest 
as a result  we do not owe any further distributions 
kohlberg co  llc  an affiliate of kohlberg investors iv  llc  whose affiliate holds all  shares of our convertible preferred stock  provides ongoing management oversight and advisory services to katy 
we paid million  million and million for such services in  and  respectively 
we expect to pay million annually in future years 
severance  restructuring and related charges see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a discussion of severance  restructuring and related charges 
outlook for we anticipate only a modest improvement in from the general economic conditions and business environment that existed in however  we have seen recent improvement in the restaurant  travel and hotel markets to which we sell products 
we have seen continued strong sales performance from the woods and woods canada retail electrical corded products business  but we do not expect to see the same level of year over year top line growth from those businesses in as we experienced in we have a significant concentration of customers in the mass market retail  discount and do it yourself market channels 
our ability to maintain and increase our sales levels depends in part on our ability to retain and improve relationships with these customers 
in addition  we face uncertainty with respect to the replacement of noma r branded sales as woods canada has lost the right to use the noma r trademark  effective mid we also face the continuing challenge of recovering or offsetting cost increases for raw materials 
gross margins have been improving and are expected to continue to improve in as we realize the benefits of various profit enhancing strategies implemented since the recapitalization 
these strategies include sourcing previously manufactured products  as well as locating new sources for products already sourced outside of our facilities 
we have significantly reduced headcount  and continue to examine issues related to excess facilities 
cost of goods sold is subject to variability in the prices for certain raw materials  most significantly thermoplastic resins used in the manufacture of plastic products for the jan san and consumer plastic businesses 
prices of plastic resins  such as polyethylene and polypropylene  increased steadily from the latter half of through the middle of  then fell slightly in the second half of the year  and have increased again during the early months of management has observed that the prices of plastic resins are driven to an extent by prices for crude oil and natural gas  in addition to other factors specific to the supply and demand of the resins themselves 
we cannot predict the direction resin prices will take during and beyond 
we are also exposed to price changes for copper a primary material in many of the products sold by woods and woods canada  aluminum and steel primary materials in production of truck boxes  corrugated packaging material and other raw materials 
prices for copper  aluminum and steel all have increased in recent months 
we have not employed an active hedging program related to our commodity price risk  but are employing other strategies for managing this risk  including contracting for a certain percentage of resin needs through supply agreements and opportunistic spot purchases 
in a climate of rising raw material costs  we experience difficulty in raising prices to shift these higher costs to our customers 
depreciation expense was higher during as a result of the reduction in depreciable lives for certain ccp manufacturing assets  specifically molds and tooling equipment used in the manufacture of plastic products  from seven to five years  effective january  this change in estimate was made following significant impairments to these types of assets recorded during the amount of incremental depreciation expense during as a result of this reduction in depreciable lives was million 
however  many of these assets became fully depreciated during since the ccp acquisition occurred in early therefore  depreciation expense related to these assets is expected to reduce again in and subsequent years 
our total depreciation expense in and subsequent years will also depend on changes in the level of depreciable assets 
selling  general and administrative expenses have remained stable and are expected to continue to remain stable as a percentage of sales from levels 
cost reduction efforts are ongoing throughout the company 
our corporate office was relocated in and we expect to maintain modest headcount and rental costs for that office 
we have completed the process of transferring most back office functions of our wilen mops  brooms and brushes and glit microtron abrasives businesses from georgia to bridgeton  missouri  the headquarters of ccp 
we are nearly complete with the process of transferring most back office functions of our disco filters and miscellaneous food service items business in mcdonough  georgia to st 
louis  missouri 
we will continue to evaluate the possibility of further consolidation of administrative processes at our subsidiaries 
we have announced or committed to several restructuring plans involving our operations 
during and  we announced plans to consolidate the warson road and earth city facilities as well as a portion of the hazelwood facility into the bridgeton facility 
all of these facilities are located in the st 
louis  missouri area 
the moves from the warson road  hazelwood and earth city facilities are now complete 
hazelwood will continue to operate on a satellite basis 
certain molding machines have been and will continue to be transferred to the bridgeton facility and excess machinery will be sold 
the significant charges recorded during and related to these facilities were mainly to accrue non cancelable lease payments for these facilities ie  non incremental cash 
we expect the jan san and consumer plastics business units to continue to benefit from lower overhead costs in as a result of these consolidations 
further facility consolidations with respect to the ccp operations are under review 
in december  we closed the woods canada manufacturing facility in toronto  necessitated by our decision to fully outsource its products to lower cost sources 
prior to the plant closure  woods canada already sourced a portion of its finished goods from vendors 
while outsourcing of the woods canada products is a cost saving measure  woods canada expects to maintain higher inventory levels  especially through mid  as a result of this move 
we have committed to other restructuring alternatives as well  most of which center around consolidation of operations into fewer facilities 
certain of these projects will require additional levels of cash for both capital expenditures and moving and relocation costs 
capital expenditures  severance  restructuring and related costs  and potential asset impairments related to these initiatives are expected to be approximately million to million during we continue to pursue a strategy within the maintenance products group to simplify our business transactions and improve our customer relationships 
we have centralized customer service functions for the continental jan san  glit microtron  wilen and disco business units allowing customers to order products from any ccp division on one purchase order 
we expect to include the loren and ccp canada business units as part of this shared services model during we believe that operating these businesses as a cohesive unit will improve customer service because our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
we expect that these steps will increase customer loyalty and help in attracting new customers and increasing top line sales in future years 
our integration cost reduction efforts  integration of back office functions and simplifications of our business transactions are all dependent on executing a system integration plan 
this plan involves the migration of data across information technology platforms and implementation of new software and hardware 
the domestic systems integration plan was substantially completed in october  while the international systems integration plan will be completed by the end of we expect interest rates in to be slightly higher than  however  we cannot predict the future levels of interest rates 
in addition  after june   interest rate margins on our fleet credit agreement borrowings are determined on a pricing matrix which factors operating performance into the pricing grid 
margins dropped an additional basis points as our operating performance resulted in us obtaining the more favorable pricing for our borrowings 
during october  in accordance with the fleet credit agreement  margins on the term loan dropped an additional basis points as the balance of the term loan was reduced below million as a result of the application of proceeds from the duckback sale 
given our history of operating losses  along with guidance provided by the accounting literature covering accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of deferred tax assets carried on our books 
therefore  a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset position was recorded at december  and december   and we do not expect to record the benefit of any deferred tax assets that may be generated in we will continue to record current expense associated with foreign and state income taxes 
we are continually evaluating alternatives that relate to divestitures of non core businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
on march   we announced that we were exploring the sale of the woods and woods canada businesses 
however  on july   we announced that we decided not to pursue a sale of these businesses at that time 
on april   we announced the sale of gc waldom with net proceeds of million  resulting in a loss of million on the sale 
on september   we announced the sale of duckback for net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of million  net of tax 
cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report and the information incorporated by reference in this report contain various forward looking statements as defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management

our inability to reduce product costs  including manufacturing  sourcing  freight  and other product costs 
greater reliance on third parties for our finished goods as we increase the portion of our manufacturing that is outsourced 
our inability to reduce administrative costs through consolidation of functions and systems improvements 
our inability to execute our systems integration plan 
our inability to successfully integrate our operations as a result of the facility consolidations 
our inability to sub lease rented facilities which have been abandoned as a result of consolidation and restructuring initiatives 
our inability to achieve product price increases  especially as they relate to potentially higher raw material costs 
the potential impact of losing lines of business at large retail outlets in the discount and do it yourself markets 
competition from foreign competitors 
the potential impact of new distribution channels  such as e commerce  negatively impacting us and our existing channels

the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our foreign operations 
labor issues  including union activities that require an increase in production costs or lead to a strike  thus impairing production and decreasing sales 
we are also subject to labor relations issues at entities involved in our supply chain  including both suppliers and those involved in transportation and shipping 
changes in significant laws and government regulations affecting environmental compliance and income taxes 
our inability to sell certain assets to raise cash and de leverage our financial condition 
our inability to replace lost sales due the loss of the noma r branded products at woods canada 
words and phrases such as expects  estimates  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates and the like are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the results referred to in forward looking statements may differ materially from actual results because they involve estimates  assumptions and uncertainties 
forward looking statements included herein are as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
all forward looking statements should be viewed with caution 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item certain of our accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in our financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptances  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is deemed probable 
the company s standard shipping terms are fob shipping point 
sales discounts  returns and allowances  and cooperative advertising are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  regarding accounting for stock options and other stock awards 
apb opinion no 
dictates a measurement date concept in the determination of compensation expense related to stock awards including stock options  restricted stock  and stock appreciation rights 
katy s outstanding stock options all have established measurement dates and therefore  fixed plan accounting is applied  generally resulting in no compensation expense for stock option awards 
however  the company has issued stock appreciation rights  stock awards and restricted stock awards which are accounted for as variable stock compensation awards and compensation expense has been recorded for these awards 
compensation expense for stock awards and stock appreciation rights is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payment from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of large sized customers  especially our consumer retail customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our accounting policies state that operating divisions are to identify  at a minimum  those inventory items that are in excess of either one year s historical or one year s forecasted usage  and to use business judgment in determining which is the more appropriate metric 
those inventory items must then be evaluated on a lower of cost or market basis for realizability 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million  respectively  as of december  and december  impairments of long lived assets we regularly review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets that are to be held and used  this is done by comparing undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and determining if the carrying value of the asset asset group will be recovered by those cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or of the primary asset of an asset group 
if the future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group will not be recovered  then the asset is marked to fair value 
we monitor our operations to look for triggering events that may cause us to perform an impairment analysis 
these events include  among others  loss of product lines  poor operating performance and abandonment of facilities 
we determine the lowest level at which cash flows are separately identifiable to perform the future cash flows tests  and apply the results to the assets related to those separately identifiable cash flows 
in some cases  this may be at the individual asset level  but in other cases  it is more appropriate to perform this testing at a business unit level especially when poor operating performance was the triggering event 
for assets that are to be disposed of by sale or by a means other than by sale  the identified asset or disposal group if a group of assets or entire business unit is marked to fair value less costs to sell 
in the case of the planned sale of a business unit  sfas no 
indicates that disposal groups should be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements if cash flows of the disposal group are separately identifiable 
sfas no 
has had an impact on the application of accounting for discontinued operations  making it in general much easier to classify a business unit disposal group held for sale as a discontinued operation 
the rules covering discontinued operations prior to sfas no 
generally required that an entire segment of a business be planned for disposal in order to classify it as a discontinued operation 
we recorded significant impairments of long lived assets during  and in accordance with sfas no 
 which are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item we also recorded amounts as discontinued operations in and for all periods presented  which are detailed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets also include federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  primarily due to the significant operating losses incurred during recent years  as well as various tax credits 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical net income losses  projected future income losses and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   we increased the valuation allowance by million primarily to provide a full reserve against our net deferred tax asset position 
given the negative evidence provided by our history of operating losses  and considering guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude that it is more likely that not that our deferred tax assets would be recoverable through the generation of future taxable income 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance requirements based on future operating results and business acquisitions and dispositions  and we may adjust our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
such changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reflected in current operations through our income tax provision 
workers compensation and product liabilities we make payments for workers compensation and product liability claims generally through the use of a third party claims administrator 
we have purchased insurance coverage for large claims over our self insured retention levels 
our workers compensation and health benefit liabilities are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  and other relevant factors 
in order to consider a range of possible outcomes  we have based our estimates of liabilities in this area on several different sources of loss development factors  including those from the insurance industry  the manufacturing industry  and factors developed in house 
our general approach is to identify a reasonable  logical conclusion  typically in the middle range of the possible outcomes 
while we believe that our liabilities for workers compensation and product liability claims as of december  are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb released sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds and makes technical corrections regarding various topics  including early extinguishments of debt and sale leaseback transactions 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company adopted sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
requires certain costs and losses associated with early extinguishments of debt be reported as interest expense as a component of income from continuing operations  whereas the prior accounting guidance provided for classification of these costs and losses as extraordinary items  reported separate on a tax effected basis after income from continuing operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the company reclassifying a million write off of previously capitalized debt costs that occurred during to interest expense in income from continuing operations during  which had previously been classified as an extraordinary item 
during  the company wrote off million of previously capitalized debt costs in connection with the debt refinancing see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item 
this write off is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
replaces eitf issue no 
the new standard was effective for exit or restructuring activities initiated after december  the company has complied with the provisions of sfas no 
for all restructuring activities commenced during see note for further information on the company s restructuring activities 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
katy has determined that its disclosures in regards to guarantees are in accordance with fin in january  fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 was released 
the interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the guidelines of the interpretation will become applicable for the company in its first quarter financial statements 
katy is reviewing fin to determine its impact  if any  on future reporting periods  and does not currently anticipate any material accounting or disclosure requirements under the provisions of this interpretation 
in april  the fasb released sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
katy does not currently use derivative instruments or participate in hedging activities and therefore  does not expect sfas no 
to impact its financial reporting 
if katy were to utilize derivative instruments or participate in hedging activities  it would follow the provisions of sfas no 
in may  the fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are to be classified and measured 
it requires that certain financial instruments within its scope be classified as a liability or an asset in some circumstances  while many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for the third quarter of katy has determined that sfas no 
does not impact its financial reporting 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised statement requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the disclosure provisions of the revised statement have been reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item environmental and other contingencies the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions are involved in remedial activities at certain present and former locations and have been identified by the epa  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund act or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities amounts that it deems reasonable and believes that any liability with respect to these matters in excess of the accrual will not be material 
the ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matter in which the company is currently involved relates to the wj smith site 
in  the epa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the wj smith site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
in december  banco del atlantico plaintiff  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit in texas against woods  a subsidiary of katy  and against certain past and or then present officers  directors and former owners of woods collectively  defendants 
the plaintiff alleges that the defendants participated in violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
in its recently filed amended complaint  the plaintiff also alleges violations of the indiana rico and crime victims act 
all of the foregoing is alleged to have occurred prior to katy s purchase of woods 
the plaintiff alleges that it made loans to a mexican corporation controlled by certain past officers and directors of woods based upon fraudulent representations and guarantees 
in addition to its fraud  conspiracy  and rico claims  the plaintiff seeks recovery upon certain alleged guarantees purportedly executed by woods wire products  inc  a predecessor company from which woods purchased certain assets in the primary legal theories under which the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damages are respondeat superior  conspiracy  successor liability  or a combination of the three 
on march   the southern district of texas court ordered that the case be transferred to the southern district of indiana on the ground that indiana has a closer relationship to this case than texas 
the case is currently pending in the southern district of indiana 
the plaintiff filed its amended complaint on december  pursuant to court order  the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on february  all defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint and all claims contained within it on grounds of forum non conveniens and comity 
all defendants have also moved to dismiss the indiana rico and indiana crime victims act claims as barred by the applicable statutes of limitations 
additionally  woods and certain other defendants have separately moved to dismiss certain claims of the amended complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 
the plaintiff s responses to these motions to dismiss have not yet been filed 
the parties are currently engaged in discovery  and the trial of the action assuming any is needed is scheduled for january the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of million and is requesting that damages be trebled under indiana and federal rico  and or the indiana crime victims act 
because defendants motions to dismiss have not yet been briefed and certain jurisdictional issues have not yet been fully adjudicated  it is not possible at this time for the company to reasonably determine an outcome or accurately estimate the range of potential exposure 
katy may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement through which katy acquired woods  and under state  federal and common law 
woods may also have indemnity claims against the former officers and directors 
in addition  there is a dispute with the former owners of woods regarding the final disposition of amounts withheld from the purchase price  which may be subject to further adjustment as a result of the claims by the plaintiff 
the extent or limit of any such adjustment cannot be predicted at this time 
an adverse judgment in this matter could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position if the company were not able to exercise recourse against the former owner of woods 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
the company estimates that it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome on certain claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported to the company or its insurance providers  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
since  woods canada has used the noma r trademark in canada under the terms of a license with gentek inc gentek 
in october  gentek filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
in july  as part of the bankruptcy proceedings  gentek filed a motion to reject this trademark license agreement 
on november   gentek s motion was granted by the us bankruptcy court 
as a result  the trademark license agreement is no longer in effect 
woods canada will use the noma r trademark through mid and  thereafter  will lose the right to brand certain of its product with the noma r trademark 
approximately of woods canada s sales are of noma r branded products 
woods canada will seek to replace those sales with sales of other products and will continue to act as a supplier for the new licensee of the noma r trademark 
however  there is no guarantee that woods canada will be able to replace the lost sales of noma r branded products 
although we believe that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable
