item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the approximate percentages of net patient revenue of our facilities excluding glades general hospital from these sources during the periods specified below were as follows year ended december  source medicare medicaid other total management information systems following the acquisition of a hospital  we implement our systematic procedures to improve the hospital s operating and financial performance 
in many cases  one of our first steps is to convert the newly acquired hospital to our broad based management information system 
our hospital management information system contains the primary software required to run an entire hospital  bundled into one software package 
this software generally includes features such as a general ledger  patient accounting  billing  accounts receivable  payroll  accounts payable and pharmacy 
our goal is to convert an acquired hospital to our management information system within days from the date of the acquisition 
quality assurance our hospitals implement quality assurance procedures to monitor the level of care 
each hospital also has a medical executive committee  which reviews the professional credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the hospital 
each facility monitors outcomes along with procedures performed and the quality of the logistical  medical and technological support provided to the physician 
we survey our patients either during their stay at the hospital or subsequently by mail to identify potential areas of improvement 
all of our hospitals are accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 
regulatory compliance program we maintain a company wide compliance program 
our compliance program focuses on all areas of regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement  cost reporting practices and laboratory and home healthcare operations 
each of our hospitals designates a compliance officer and undergoes an annual risk assessment to determine potential risk issues and develop plans to correct problems should they arise 
in addition  all of our employees are given a thorough introduction to our ethical and compliance guidelines  as well as a guide to the proper resources to address any concerns that may arise 
we also conduct annual training to re emphasize our established guidelines 
we regularly monitor our corporate compliance programs to respond to developments in healthcare regulation and the industry 
we also maintain a toll free hotline to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis 
in addition  the hotline is a method of obtaining answers to questions of compliance encountered during the day to day operation of a facility 

table of contents management and professional services brim healthcare  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  provides management services to primarily non urban hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 
these services are provided for a fixed monthly fee under three to seven year contracts 
brim healthcare  inc generally provides a chief executive officer  who is an employee of brim healthcare  inc  and also may provide a chief financial officer 
brim healthcare  inc 
typically does not employ other hospital personnel 
management services typically are limited to strategic planning  operational consulting and assistance with joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations accreditation and compliance 
to further promote compliance  brim healthcare  inc requires that each of the hospitals that it manages have a compliance officer 
in addition  to assist hospitals and community healthcare  brim healthcare  inc sometimes establishes regional provider networks 
this subsidiary represented of revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  and of revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  competition the primary bases of competition among hospitals in non urban markets are the quality and scope of medical services  strength of referral network  location  and  to a lesser extent  price 
with respect to the delivery of general acute hospital services  most of our hospitals face less competition in their immediate patient service areas than would be expected in larger communities 
while our hospitals are generally the primary provider of healthcare services in their respective communities  our hospitals face competition from larger tertiary care centers and  in some cases  other non urban hospitals and full service outpatient surgery centers 
some of the hospitals that compete with us are owned by governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions  and can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
one of the most significant factors in the competitive position of a hospital is the number and quality of physicians affiliated with the hospital 
although physicians may at any time terminate their affiliation with a hospital that we operate  our hospitals seek to retain physicians of varied specialties on the hospitals medical staffs and to recruit other qualified physicians through our in house recruiting department overseen by our vice president of medical staff development and his staff 
we believe the key reasons physicians refer patients to a hospital are the quality of services it renders to patients and physicians  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital s facilities  equipment and employees 
accordingly  we strive to maintain high ethical and professional standards and quality facilities  equipment  employees and services for physicians and their patients 
another factor in the competitive position of a hospital is the management s ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete on the basis of market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of the medical staff  convenience and price for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market  depending on the market strength of such organizations 
managed care contracts generally are less important in the non urban markets served by us than they are in urban and suburban markets where there is typically a higher level of managed care penetration 
state certificate of need laws  which place limitations on a hospital s ability to expand hospital services and add new equipment  also may have the effect of restricting competition 
five states in which we operate  alabama  florida  mississippi  nevada and virginia currently have certificate of need laws 
the application process for approval of covered services  facilities  changes in operations and capital expenditures is  therefore  highly competitive 
in those states that have no certificate of need laws or that set relatively high thresholds before expenditures become reviewable by state authorities  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending may be more prevalent 
we have not experienced  and do not expect to experience  any material adverse 
table of contents effects from state certificate of need requirements or from the imposition  elimination or relaxation of such requirements 
see item business healthcare regulation and licensing 
we  and the healthcare industry as a whole  face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs  strong competition for patients and a slow growth in reimbursement rates by both private and government payors 
as both private and government payors reduce the scope of what may be reimbursed and reduce reimbursement levels for what is covered  federal and state efforts to reform the healthcare system may further impact reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors may require changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 
the hospital industry and some of our hospitals continue to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor required pre admission authorization  utilization review  and payment mechanisms to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
admissions constraints  payor pressures and increased competition are expected to continue 
we will endeavor to meet these challenges by expanding our facilities outpatient services  offering appropriate discounts to private payor groups  upgrading facilities and equipment  and offering new programs and services 
we also face competition for acquisitions primarily from for profit hospital management companies as well as not for profit entities 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than us 
increased competition for the acquisition of non urban acute care hospitals could have an adverse impact on our ability to acquire such hospitals on favorable terms 
properties in addition to real estate associated with our owned and leased hospitals  we lease approximately  square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in brentwood  tennessee under a ten year lease that expires on december  and contains customary terms and conditions 
see item business owned and leased hospitals 
employees and medical staff as of march   we had  full time equivalent employees  including corporate personnel and management company personnel 
the remaining employees  most of whom are nurses and office personnel  work at the hospitals 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
approximately of our employees are represented by unions 
we typically do not employ physicians  however  as of march   we employed practicing physicians 
certain of our hospital services  including emergency room coverage  radiology  pathology and anesthesiology services  are provided through independent contractor arrangements with physicians 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
our healthcare operations generate medical waste  such as pharmaceuticals  biological materials and disposable medical instruments  that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations  as well as our purchases and sales of facilities  also are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we do not expect that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
environmental regulations also may apply when we renovate or refurbish hospitals  particularly older facilities 
while these requirements may impose some additional costs for such improvements  we do not expect these amounts to be material 

table of contents government reimbursement medicare medicaid reimbursement for the year ended december   approximately and of our net patient revenue from continuing operations resulted from medicare and medicaid payments  respectively 
the medicare program pays hospitals on a prospective payment system for acute inpatient services 
under this prospective payment system  a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the patient s final diagnosis 
these payments do not take into consideration a specific hospital s costs  but instead are set national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case mix index 
certain sub acute inpatient services  which historically were reimbursed on a hospital s costs  are currently being converted by medicare to a prospective payment system 
rehabilitation sub acute services were converted to a prospective payment system for cost report periods beginning on or after january  this system is similar to the acute inpatient system because it pays a rate based on the type of discharge 
skilled nursing sub acute services are paid based on a prospective per diem  which is also tied to the patient s needs and condition 
psychiatric sub acute services are also transitioning to a prospective payment system 
with respect to implementations of the proposed prospective payment system for psychiatric services  the centers for medicare and medicaid services is proposing a three year transition period starting with the cost reporting period beginning on or after april  for these three years  cms is proposing a blended payment 
the prospective payment for this first transition period would consist of based on the current cost based reimbursement system and on the proposed federal prospective payment rate 
in the second year  the split will be each and in the third year the split will be based on the current cost based system and prospective payment system 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   the prospective payment federal rate percentage will be 
for several years  the percentage increases to the prospective payment rates have been lower than the percentage increases in the cost of goods and services purchased by general hospitals 
the index used to adjust payment rates is based on a price proxy  known as the hospital market basket index  reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors 
for fiscal year  the hospital market basket index was rebased and revised based on data 
acute care hospitals received medicare payment rate increases for inpatient services based upon the full market basket increase in federal fiscal year on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare prescription drug act 
the medicare prescription drug act provides for changes in medicare reimbursement for hospitals 
for example  the medicare prescription drug act requires all acute care hospitals to participate in cms s quality of care national voluntary hospital reporting initiative in order to receive the full market basket increase in fiscal year through those acute care hospitals that fail to participate in cms s quality of care national voluntary reporting initiative will receive a lesser increase in medicare reimbursement equal to the market basket update minus percent 
many of our hospitals receive an add on to the medicare drg payment for providing care to indigent patients 
this add on is referred to as the disproportionate share adjustment 
section of the medicare prescription drug act increases the cap on the disproportionate share adjustment from to for rural hospitals 
this increase in the cap will be effective april  we currently have eight hospitals that will benefit from this change 
approximately labor share of the medicare drg payment is adjusted by the hospital s wage index 
the wage index compares the cost of labor in the hospital s market compared to the national average 
for those hospitals with wage indices over  the labor share is increased and  for those hospitals with wage indices under  the labor share is reduced 
section of the medicare drg bill reduces the labor share to of the drg payment for those hospitals with wage indices below 
we currently have fifteen hospitals that will benefit from this change 
most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system 
the balanced budget act of mandated the implementation of the prospective payment system for medicare outpatient services 
this outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications 
each ambulatory payment classification represents a bundle of outpatient services  
table of contents and each ambulatory payment classification has been assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate 
on november   the centers for medicare and medicaid services published the final rule establishing the calendar year conversion factor and revisions to ambulatory payment classifications for hospital outpatient services 
the conversion factor was increased by  the full market basket for fiscal year the medicare prescription drug act extends for two years special payments to small rural hospitals with or fewer beds to ensure that they are paid at least as much under the outpatient prospective payment system as they had been paid under the prior cost based system 
these special payments were first authorized by the balanced budget refinement act of  and were scheduled to end for services on or after january  besides extending the special payments for an additional two year period  the medicare prescription drug act also makes sole community hospitals regardless of the number of beds eligible for the special payments 
a sole community hospital is generally the only hospital in at least a mile radius or a minute driving time radius 
colorado plains medical center  colorado river medical center  northeastern nevada regional hospital  havasu regional medical center  teche regional medical center  palo verde hospital  parkview regional hospital and los alamos medical center qualify as sole community hospitals under medicare regulations 
medicare has other special payment provisions for sole community hospitals 
special payment provisions related to sole community hospitals include the payment of a hospital s specific rate which may be higher than the federal drg payment rate 
each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by such state and the federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources 
as a result  each state medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
program adjustments the medicare  medicaid and tricare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to facilities 
the final determination of amounts earned under the programs often takes many years because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions including final settlements are included in consolidated statements of income in the period in which the revisions are made 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for such adjustments 
until final adjustment  however  significant issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
because of information technology problems at cms  prior to may  united states hospitals were unable to file medicare cost reports for periods ending on or after august  between may and may  we filed two years of cost reports for our hospitals based on the timetable developed by cms 
between may and december  we filed cost reports 
as of april  we were back to the normal filing dates 
healthcare regulation and licensing background information healthcare  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
medicare  medicaid  and other public and private hospital cost containment programs  proposals to limit healthcare spending  and proposals to limit prices and industry competitive factors are among the many factors that are highly significant to the healthcare industry 
in addition  the healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws  rules and regulations that are extremely complex and for which the industry has the benefit of only limited regulatory or judicial interpretation 

table of contents there continue to be federal and state proposals that would  and actions that do  impose more limitations on government and private payments to providers such as us 
in addition  there are proposals to increase co payments and deductibles from program and private patients 
our facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay 
such controls  including what is commonly referred to as utilization review  have resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
various states have applied  or are considering applying  for a federal waiver from current medicaid regulations to allow them to serve some of their medicaid participants through managed care providers 
these proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured  and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals  physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under medicaid 
certificate of need requirements some states require approval for purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services and certain other matters 
five states in which we currently own hospitals  alabama  florida  mississippi  nevada and virginia  have certificate of need laws 
in addition  we may in the future buy additional hospitals in states that require certificates of need 
we are unable to predict whether our hospitals will be able to obtain any certificates of need that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required 
anti kickback and self referral regulations sections of the anti fraud and abuse amendments to the social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicaid or medicare or other federal healthcare programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by medicare or other government programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
pursuant to the medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of  the us department of health and human services issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti kickback statute 
a given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal  however  business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria risk increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of or hipaa  which became effective january   added several new fraud and abuse laws 
these new laws cover all health insurance programs private as well as governmental 
in addition  hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws  such as the anti kickback statute  to include not just medicare and medicaid services  but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program 
there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the courts and congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased  as evidenced by recent highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
in addition  provisions of the social security act prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements 
certain exceptions are available for 
table of contents employment agreements  leases  physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements 
these provisions are known as the stark law and are named for the legislative sponsor  rep 
fortney pete stark r ca 
a person making a referral  or seeking payment for services referred  in violation of the stark law would be subject to the following sanctions civil money penalties of up to  for each service  restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims  and or exclusion from participation in the medicare program  which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from participation in state healthcare programs 
further  if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should know has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity  and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity  then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil money penalty of up to  many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
federal false claims act the government has shown an increasing willingness in recent years to bring lawsuits against healthcare providers alleging violations of a variety of healthcare and non healthcare laws  including  among others  the federal false claims act the false claims act and mail fraud and wire fraud 
the false claims act  in particular  has been used with increasing frequency and creativity 
the false claims act has qui tam or whistleblower provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government 
if the action is successful  the private individual may recover up to one third of the government s recovery 
the false claims act provides for a penalty of up to three times the amount of the false claim  plus up to  for each claim falsely submitted to the government 
healthcare facility licensing requirements our healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local legislation and regulation 
in order to maintain their operating licenses  healthcare facilities must comply with strict standards concerning medical care  equipment and hygiene 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our healthcare facilities hold all required material governmental approvals  licenses and permits 
all licenses  provider numbers and other permits or approvals required to perform our business operations are held by our subsidiaries 
all of our hospitals are fully accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance our healthcare facilities are subject to and comply with various forms of utilization review 
in addition  under the medicare prospective payment system  each state has a quality improvement organization to carry out federally mandated systems of review of medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges in hospitals 
medical and surgical services and practices also are supervised extensively by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility  are overseen by each healthcare facility s local governing board  the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members  and are reviewed by our quality assurance personnel 
the local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care  develop long range plans  establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  and 
table of contents approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
governmental developments regarding sales of not for profit hospitals in recent years  the legislatures and attorneys general of several states have shown a heightened level of interest in transactions involving the sale of non profit hospitals 
although the level of interest varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review  and in some cases approval and ongoing oversight  of transactions in which not for profit corporations sell a healthcare facility 
attorneys general in certain states  including california  have been especially active in evaluating these transactions 
medical records privacy laws there are currently numerous laws at the state and federal levels addressing patient privacy concerns 
federal regulations issued pursuant to hipaa contain  among other measures  provisions that require many organizations  including us  to implement very significant and potentially expensive new computer systems  employee training programs and business procedures 
the federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
on august   the department of health and human services finalized regulations requiring our facilities to use standard data formats and code sets established by the rule when electronically transmitting information in connection with several transactions  including health claims and equivalent encounter information  health care payment and remittance advice and health claim status 
on february   the department of health and human services issued final modifications to these regulations 
compliance with these regulations was required on october  we have implemented or upgraded computer systems  as appropriate  at our facilities and at our corporate headquarters to comply with the new transaction and code set regulations and have tested these systems with several of our payors 
although compliance with the transaction and code set regulations was required on october   the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  announced on september  that it would implement a contingency plan to accept noncompliant electronic transactions after the october  deadline 
cms has announced that it will regularly reassess the readiness of its trading partners to comply with the regulations in order to determine how long the contingency plan will remain in effect 
blue cross blue shield plans in several states have announced similar contingency plans 
our facilities are currently operating under contingency plans with several of our payors 
hipaa requires the department of health and human services to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals  employers  health plans and health care providers to be used in connection with the standard electronic transactions 
on may   the department of health and human services issued a proposed rule to establish a unique number for healthcare providers that will be used by health plans 
additionally  on may   the department of health and human services issued a final rule that calls for using the employer identification number the taxpayer identifying number for employers that is assigned by the internal revenue service as the identifying number that will be used by all health plans 
most health care organizations  including us  must comply with this final rule by july  health plans  health care clearinghouses and providers would use these identifiers  among other uses  in connection with the electronic transactions standards 
on january   the department of health and human services published a final rule that adopted the national provider identifier npi as the standard unique health identifier for healthcare providers 
when the npi is implemented  healthcare providers  including our facilities  will use only the npi to identify themselves in connection with electronic transactions 
legacy numbers  such as medicaid numbers  champus numbers  and blue cross blue shield numbers  will not be permitted 
healthcare providers will no longer have to keep track of multiple numbers to identify themselves in the standard electronic transactions with one or more health plans 
the npi will be a digit all numeric number that will be assigned to eligible healthcare providers by the national provider system nps  an independent government contractor 
under the final rule  all healthcare providers may 
table of contents begin applying for npis on may  with the nps 
all healthcare providers  including our facilities  must obtain and start using npis in connection with the standard electronic transactions no later than may  the department of health and human services has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for a national health plan or individual identifier 
once these regulations are issued in final form  we expect to have about two years to become fully compliant 
on february   the department of health and human services finalized a rule that establishes  in part  standards to protect the confidentiality  availability and integrity of health information by health plans  health care clearinghouses and health care providers that receive  store  maintain or transmit health and related financial information in electronic form  regardless of format 
these security standards require us to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity  confidentiality and the availability of electronic health and related financial information 
the security standards were designed to protect electronic information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and to protect the information against unauthorized use or disclosure 
although the security standards do not reference or advocate a specific technology  and covered health care providers  plans and clearinghouses have the flexibility to choose their own technical solutions  we expect that the security standards will require us to implement significant new systems  business procedures and training programs 
we must comply with these security regulations by april  on december   the department of health and human services published a final rule establishing standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
the final rule establishing the privacy standards became effective on april   with compliance required by april  on august   the department of health and human services published final revisions to the privacy rule 
the final revisions did not alter the compliance date of april  for the majority of the requirements in the privacy regulations 
these privacy standards apply to all health plans  all health care clearinghouses and health care providers that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with the standard transactions 
our facilities are covered entities under the final rule 
the privacy standards apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form  whether communicated electronically  on paper or orally 
these standards impose extensive new administrative requirements on us 
they require our compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of this health information 
they create new rights for patients in their health information  such as the right to amend their health information  and they require us to impose these rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf 
we successfully met the privacy standard deadline  but compliance is an ongoing process 
in addition  our facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these state laws vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
a violation of these regulations could result in civil money penalties of per incident  up to a maximum of  per person per year per standard 
hipaa also provides for criminal penalties of up to  and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information  up to  and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses  and up to  and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell  transfer or use such information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
because there is no history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the hipaa regulations or the potential for fines and penalties which may result from the violation of the regulations 
we expect that compliance with these standards will require significant commitment and action by us and our facilities 
we have appointed members of our management team to direct our compliance with these standards 
implementation will require us to engage in extensive preparation and make significant expenditures 
at this time we have appointed a privacy officer at each facility  prepared privacy policies  trained our workforce on these policies and entered into business associate agreements with the appropriate vendors 
because some of the regulations are proposed regulations  we cannot predict the total financial impact of the regulations on our operations 

table of contents emergency medical treatment and active labor act all of our facilities are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
this federal law requires any hospital that participates in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who enters the hospital s emergency department for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition  to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition 
the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in addition  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital 
in september of  cms released final regulations to clarify hospitals obligations under emtala 
the final regulations included a new definition of dedicated emergency department  and clarified that emtala does not apply to inpatients 
the final regulations also clarified a hospital s emtala obligations with respect to hospital owned ambulances  outpatient departments  off campus provider based entities  and other locations within the hospital other than the dedicated emergency department 
the final rule also addressed a hospital s physician on call responsibilities 
under the final rule  each hospital must maintain an on call list that best meets the needs of its patients  but only in accordance with the resources available to the hospital 
there is no set formula for on call obligations in the final rules  and the final rules recognize that not all hospitals will be able to have every specialist on call at all times 
hospitals must maintain written procedures to be followed when a specialist is not on call or a physician is not available due to circumstances beyond the physician s control 
the hospital s written procedures may also provide for situations in which the on call physician is performing elective surgery or on call simultaneously with other facilities 
we believe that our facilities comply with emtala 
california seismic standards california s alfred e 
alquist hospital facilities seismic safety act the alquist act requires that the california building standards commission adopt earthquake performance categories  seismic evaluation procedures  standards and timeframes for upgrading certain facilities  and seismic retrofit building standards 
these regulations require hospitals to meet seismic performance standards to ensure that they are capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
the building standards commission completed its adoption of evaluation criteria and retrofit standards in the alquist act requires that within three years after the building standards commission has adopted evaluation criteria and retrofit standards certain hospitals must conduct seismic evaluations and submit these evaluations to the office of statewide health planning and development  facilities development division for its review and approval  hospitals must identify the most critical nonstructural systems that represent the greatest risk of failure during an earthquake and submit timetables for upgrading these systems to the office of statewide health planning and development  facilities development division for its review and approval  and regulated hospitals must prepare a plan and compliance schedule for each regulated building demonstrating the steps a hospital will take to bring the hospital buildings into substantial compliance with the regulations and standards 
we are required to conduct engineering studies of our two california facilities to determine whether and to what extent modifications to our facilities will be required  and have submitted compliance plans for our california facilities with the state of california 
any facilities not currently in compliance with the applicable seismic 
table of contents regulations and standards must be brought into compliance by  or if the facility obtains an extension 
we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with the seismic standards  which could impact our earnings 
professional liability as part of our business  we are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of hospital operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage of approximately  although some claims may exceed the scope of the coverage in effect 
we have purchased a tail policy that provides an unlimited claim reporting period for our professional liability for claims incurred in and prior years 
we also maintain a claims made policy and have provided an actuarial based accrual for incurred but not reported claims 
recently  the cost of malpractice and other liability insurance has risen significantly 
therefore  adequate levels of insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable price 
through our typical hospital management contract  we attempt to protect ourselves from such liability by requiring the hospital to maintain certain specified limits of insurance coverage  including professional liability  comprehensive general liability  worker s compensation and fidelity insurance  and by requiring the hospital to name brim healthcare  inc  our hospital management subsidiary  as an additional insured party on the hospital s professional and comprehensive general liability policies 
we also maintain certain contingent liability policies designed to cover contingent exposure brim healthcare  inc could incur under such management contracts 
our management contracts generally provide that we be indemnified by the hospital against claims that arise out of hospital operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the hospitals will maintain such insurance or that such indemnities will be available

principal risk factors that may affect our business and results of operations if government programs reduce the payments we receive as reimbursement for our services  our revenues may decline 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
the federal balanced budget act of  which established a plan to balance the federal budget by fiscal year  included significant reductions in spending levels for the medicare and medicaid programs  including payment reductions for inpatient and outpatient hospital services  establishment of a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services  skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies under medicare  and repeal of the federal payment standard often referred to as the boren amendment for hospitals and nursing facilities  which could result in lower medicaid reimbursement rates 
the financial impact of the federal balanced budget act of  however  has been lessened somewhat by the medicare  medicaid  and schip benefits improvement and protection act of  although significant revisions in how hospitals are paid for some services are still proceeding 
we cannot predict the impact of future legislative and regulatory actions which might be taken to reduce medicare and medicaid payment levels 

table of contents in the future  congress and state legislatures could introduce proposals to make major changes in the healthcare system 
if these proposals are enacted  we may see a decline in the medicare and medicaid reimbursements we receive for our services  however  at this time  we do not know what healthcare reform legislation will be enacted or whether any changes in healthcare programs will occur 
the healthcare cost containment initiatives and the financial condition of purchasers of healthcare services may limit our revenue and profitability 
during the past several years  major purchasers of healthcare  such as federal and state governments  insurance companies and employers  have undertaken initiatives to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs 
as part of their efforts to contain healthcare costs  purchasers increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements 
we expect efforts to impose reduced allowances  greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors to continue 
in addition  we anticipate that organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages may represent an increasing portion of our patient admissions 
an increasing number of managed care organizations have experienced financial difficulties in recent years  in some cases resulting in bankruptcy or insolvency 
in some instances  organizations with provider agreements with certain of our hospitals have become insolvent  and the hospitals have been unable to collect the full amounts due from such organizations 
other managed care organizations with whom we do business may encounter similar difficulties in paying claims in the future 
we believe that reductions in the payments we receive for our services  coupled with the increased percentage of patient admissions from organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services and difficulty in collecting receivables from managed care organizations  could reduce our overall revenue and profitability 
if we fail to comply with regulations regarding licenses  ownership and operation  we could impair our ability to operate or expand our operations in any state 
all of the states in which we operate require hospitals and most healthcare facilities to maintain a license 
in addition  some states require prior approval for the purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities  based upon a state s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
such determinations  embodied in certificates of need issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities  may be required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services and other matters 
five states in which we currently own hospitals  alabama  florida  mississippi  nevada and virginia  have certificate of need laws 
the failure to obtain any required certificate of need or the failure to maintain a required license could impair our ability to operate or expand operations in any state 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation regarding conduct of our operations and our relationships with physicians 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
the healthcare industry must comply with many laws and regulations at federal  state and local governmental levels 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation 
in particular  medicare and medicaid anti fraud and abuse provisions  known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit some business practices and relationships related to items or services reimbursable under medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
for instance  the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare service providers from paying or receiving remuneration to induce or arrange for the referral of patients or items or services covered by a federal or state healthcare program 
if regulatory authorities determine that any of our hospitals arrangements violate the anti kickback statute  we could be subject to liabilities under the social security act  including criminal penalties  civil monetary penalties  and or 
table of contents exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  any of which could impair our ability to operate one or more of our hospitals or to operate profitably 
there are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security concerns 
in particular  federal regulations issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of contain provisions that have required  and in the future may require us to implement costly new computer systems and to adopt business procedures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patients individually identifiable health and related financial information 
compliance with the privacy regulations was required on april  for most health care organizations  including us 
the privacy regulations are expected to have a financial impact on the health care industry because they impose extensive new administrative requirements  restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health and related financial information  provide patients with new rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy regulation requirements to third parties who perform functions on our behalf involving health information 
on february   the department of health and human services issued final security regulations 
compliance with these security regulations is required by april  for most health care organizations  including us 
these security regulations require us to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity  confidentiality and availability of electronically received  maintained or transmitted patient individually identifiable health and related financial information 
we cannot predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on our business 
compliance with these regulations requires substantial expenditures  which could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  our management has spent  and may spend in the future  substantial time and effort on compliance measures 
on august   the department of health and human services issued regulations requiring most health care organizations  including us  to use standard data formats and code sets by october  when electronically transmitting information in connection with several types of transactions  including health claims  health care payment and remittance advice and health claim status transactions 
violations of the privacy  security and transaction regulations could subject us to civil penalties of up to  per calendar year for each provision contained in the privacy  security and transaction regulations that is violated and criminal penalties of up to  per violation for certain other violations 
because there is no history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with these regulations or the potential for fines and penalties which may result from the violation of the regulations 
we met the privacy standard compliance deadline  but compliance will be an ongoing process 
we are in the process of complying with the transaction standard and the security standard 
in addition  the portion of the social security act commonly known as the stark law prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid patients to particular providers of designated health services if the physician or a member of the physician s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement with that provider 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil money penalties and possible exclusion from the medicare program 
many states have adopted or are considering similar anti kickback and physician self referral legislation 
some of the state physician self referral laws are more restrictive than the stark law  in that they apply to services reimbursed by all payors  not just by medicaid or other government payors 
moreover  the federal government has shown an increasing willingness to prosecute providers under a variety of fraud laws  including laws that have not traditionally been used for healthcare fraud  such as the federal civil false claims law and the federal mail and wire fraud laws 
there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry 
we may become the subject of an investigation in the future 
in recent years  the media and public attention have focused on the hospital industry due to ongoing investigations related to referral  cost reporting and billing practices  
table of contents laboratory and home healthcare services  and physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals 
both federal and state government agencies have announced heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
in addition  the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services and the department of justice have established enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
recent initiatives include a focus on hospital billing for outpatient charges associated with inpatient services  as well as hospital laboratory billing practices 
we cannot predict with accuracy whether we or other hospital operators will be the subject of future investigations or inquiries 
in the event that we become the subject of an investigation  we will be required to devote management and financial resources to defending our company in the investigation 
in addition  any negative publicity surrounding the investigation could affect adversely the trading price of our securities 
if we incur significant fines or penalties or are forced to reimburse amounts as a result of the investigation  our profitability may decline 
we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our acquisition program and capital expenditures  and additional financing may not be available when needed 
our acquisition program requires substantial capital resources 
likewise  the operations of our existing hospitals require ongoing capital expenditures for renovation  expansion and the addition of medical equipment and technology utilized in the hospitals 
for example  if specified operating targets are achieved  we have agreed to build replacement facilities for eunice community medical center  expected to cost approximately million 
we may need to incur additional indebtedness and may issue  from time to time  debt or equity securities to fund these expenditures 
we may not receive financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  our existing level of indebtedness may restrict our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we are not able to obtain financing  then we may not be in a position to consummate acquisitions or undertake capital expenditures 
our growth strategy depends on acquisitions  and we may not be able to manage our growth effectively or acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria 
we also may have difficulties acquiring hospitals from non profit entities due to regulatory scrutiny 
a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals in attractive non urban markets 
we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other for profit healthcare companies 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
even though we may acquire additional hospitals  we may not be able to acquire a sufficient number of hospitals that meet our target criteria in order to implement successfully our growth strategy 
hospital acquisitions generally require a longer period to complete than acquisitions in many other businesses and are subject to additional regulatory uncertainty 
in recent years  the legislatures and attorneys general of some states have shown a heightened level of interest in transactions involving the sale of hospitals by not for profit entities 
although the level of interest varies from state to state  the trend is to provide for increased governmental review  and in some cases approval and ongoing oversight  of transactions in which not for profit entities sell a healthcare facility 
attorneys general in some states have been especially active in evaluating these transactions 
although we have not yet been adversely affected as a result of these trends  such increased scrutiny may increase the difficulty or prevent the completion of transactions with not for profit organizations in some states in the future  and may affect our ability to exercise existing purchase options for hospitals under current hospital lease agreements 

table of contents we have a concentration of revenue in texas and arizona  which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states 
palestine regional medical center  ennis regional medical center and parkview regional medical center  each located in texas  collectively accounted for of our net patient revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  this concentration makes us particularly sensitive to economic  competitive and regulatory conditions in texas 
any adverse change in these conditions could reduce significantly our revenues and profitability 
we also own havasu regional medical center in lake havasu city  arizona  which accounted for approximately of our net patient revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  similarly  this concentration of revenue in arizona makes us particularly sensitive to economic  competitive and regulatory conditions in arizona 
any adverse change in these conditions could reduce significantly our revenues and profitability 
our california hospitals must comply with california seismic standards which may require us to make significant capital expenditures 
california has a statute and regulations that require hospitals to meet seismic performance standards 
regulated hospitals that do not meet the standards may be required to retrofit facilities 
california law requires that owners of regulated hospitals evaluate their facilities and develop a plan and schedule for complying with the standards 
we are required to conduct engineering studies of our two california facilities to determine whether and to what extent modifications to our facilities will be required 
we have submitted compliance plans for our california facilities 
any facilities not currently in compliance with the seismic regulations and standards must be brought into compliance by  or if the facility obtains an extension 
in the event that our two california facilities are found not to be in compliance with the seismic standards  we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to bring the california facilities into compliance  which could impact our earnings 
our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals at our hospitals 
the success of our owned or leased hospitals depends on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staff of  or who admit patients to  our hospitals  the admissions practices of those physicians  and the maintenance of good relations between our company and such physicians 
our success has been dependent  in part  upon recruiting quality physicians and maintaining good relations with and retaining our physicians because physicians direct admissions to our hospitals and determine the services to be provided to patients at our hospitals 
we generally do not employ physicians  and many of our staff physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals 
only a portion of physicians are interested in practicing in the non urban communities in which our hospitals are located 
the departure of physicians from these communities  such as we experienced in  or our inability to recruit physicians to these communities  could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and could affect our profitability 
also  if we are unable to maintain good relationships with physicians  our hospitals admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
in addition  hospitals nationwide are experiencing a shortage of nursing professionals  a trend which many industry observers expect to continue over the next decade 
if the supply of qualified nurses or other healthcare professionals declines in the markets in which our hospitals operate  it may result in increased labor expenses and lower operating margins at those hospitals 
we depend heavily on key personnel  and loss of the services of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local management personnel could weaken our management team and our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and on the efforts  ability and experience of key members of our local management staff 
the loss of services of one or more 
table of contents members of our senior management or of a significant portion of any of our local management staff could weaken significantly our management expertise and our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers 
other hospitals and freestanding outpatient facilities provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals  which may raise the level of competition faced by our hospitals 
in all geographic areas in which we operate  there are other healthcare providers  including hospitals  outpatient surgery centers and other outpatient facilities  that provide comparable services to those offered by our hospitals 
some of the hospitals with which we compete are owned by governmental agencies and supported by tax revenues  and others are owned by not for profit corporations and may be supported to a large extent by endowments and charitable contributions 
some of these competitors are larger  may be more established and may have more capital and other resources than we do 
many of our hospitals attempt to attract patients from surrounding counties and communities  including communities in which a competing facility exists 
if our competitors are able to finance capital improvements and expand services at their facilities  we may be unable to attract patients away from these facilities 
if we fail to improve the operations of acquired hospitals  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
some of the hospitals we have acquired or will acquire had or may have operating losses prior to the time we acquired them 
we may be unable to operate profitably any hospital or other facility we acquire  effectively integrate the operations of any acquisitions  or otherwise achieve the intended benefit of our growth strategy 
we may be subject to liabilities because of claims brought against our owned and leased hospitals 
in addition  if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities  we could become liable for material obligations 
in recent years  plaintiffs have brought actions against hospitals and other healthcare providers  alleging malpractice  product liability or other legal theories 
many of these actions involved large claims and significant defense costs 
we maintain professional malpractice liability and general liability insurance coverage of approximately  to cover claims arising out of the operations of our owned and leased hospitals 
some of the claims  however  could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect or coverage of particular claims could be denied 
while our professional and other liability insurance has been adequate in the past to provide for liability claims  such insurance may not be available for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
moreover  healthcare providers in our industry are experiencing significant increase in the premiums for malpractice insurance  and it is anticipated that such costs may continue to rise 
malpractice insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable deductible amounts 
in addition  hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
although we obtain contractual indemnification from sellers covering these matters  such indemnification may be insufficient to cover material claims or liabilities for past activities of acquired hospitals 
we may be subject to liabilities because of claims arising from our hospital management activities 
we may be subject to liabilities from the acts  omissions and liabilities of the employees of hospitals we manage or from the actions of our employees in connection with the management of such hospitals 
our hospital management contracts generally require the hospitals we manage to indemnify us against certain claims and to maintain specified amounts of insurance 
the hospitals  however  may not maintain such insurance and indemnification may not be available to us 
recently  other hospital management companies have been subject to complaints alleging that these companies violated laws on behalf of hospitals they managed 
in some cases  plaintiffs brought actions against the managing company instead of  or in addition to  their individually managed hospital clients for these violations 
our managed hospitals or other third parties may not hold us harmless for any losses we incur arising out of the acts  omissions and liabilities of the employees of the hospitals we manage 
if the 
table of contents courts determine that we are liable for amounts exceeding the limits of any insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of that coverage or any indemnity  or if any indemnity agreement is determined to be unenforceable  then the resulting liability could affect adversely our business  results of operations and financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   we owned or leased general acute care hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds  and managed primarily non urban hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 

table of contents discontinued operations on january   we signed a letter of intent to permit the palm beach healthcare district to reacquire glades general hospital in belle glade  florida 
this transaction is expected to close during the first half of pursuant to this plan of divestiture  which was approved in  and as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operations and non cash impairment of assets charge related to this hospital are reported as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements  statistics and all references to such information contained in this section have been adjusted to reflect this presentation for all periods 
our remaining hospitals are now reported as continuing operations 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of our strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
because of the financial impact of our and acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  because of the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect our overall operating performance 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  we typically take a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as we make additional hospital acquisitions  we expect that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
we also may divest certain hospitals in the future if we determine a hospital no longer fits within our strategy 
industry trends reimbursement the federal medicare program accounted for approximately  and of net patient revenue in  and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of net patient revenue in  and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislatures are continuing to scrutinize the healthcare industry for the purpose of reducing healthcare costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future healthcare reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
the balanced budget act of imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
as required by the balanced budget act of  payments for hospital outpatient  psychiatric sub acute  home health and rehabilitation sub acute services have converted to prospective payment systems  instead of payments being based on costs 
most hospital outpatient services are now reimbursed under an outpatient prospective payment system based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications 
rehabilitation sub acute services transitioned to a prospective payment system in psychiatric sub acute services are transitioning to a prospective payment system 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms is proposing a three year transition period for the implementation of the proposed prospective payment system starting with the cost reporting period for psychiatric services beginning on or after april  on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare prescription drug act 
the medicare prescription drug act provides for changes in medicare reimbursement for hospitals 
for example  the medicare prescription drug act requires all acute care hospitals to participate in cms s quality of care national voluntary hospital reporting initiative in order to receive the full market basket increase in fiscal year through those acute care hospitals that fail to participate in cms s quality of care national voluntary reporting initiative will receive a lesser increase in medicare reimbursement equal to the market basket update minus percent 

table of contents outpatient utilization the hospital industry and some of our hospitals continue to have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
we expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental healthcare programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of our hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
we expect the industry trend towards the provision of more services on an outpatient basis to continue 
this trend is the result of increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
billing and collection the billing and collection of accounts receivable by hospitals are complicated by a number of factors  including the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records  an increase in the number of patients who do not maintain health insurance  and the subjective judgment involved 
these factors  or any combination of them  may impact our ability to bill and collect our accounts receivable at the rates we have anticipated  which could negatively affect our future cash flows 
healthcare providers are experiencing an increase in their provision for doubtful accounts relating to self pay accounts receivable 
self pay revenue refers to payment for healthcare services received directly from individual patients  either in the form of a deductible or co payment under a health insurance plan or as full or partial payment of the amount charged by the provider or not covered by insurance 
the current soft economic environment  higher unemployment rates and increasing numbers of uninsured patients  combined with higher co payments and deductibles  are placing a greater portion of the financial responsibility for healthcare services on the patient rather than insurers 
additionally  many of these patients are being admitted through the emergency department and often require more costly care  resulting in higher billings 
many of these accounts remain uncollected for extended periods of time  requiring providers to increase the amounts reserved as doubtful accounts and ultimately written off as uncollectible 
although the trend is national  the ability of providers to collect self pay accounts varies greatly by geographic markets and demographic factors 
investigations the federal government and a number of states are increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws  a determination that we have violated such laws  or even the public announcement that we were being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
our historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by our success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while we believe that the healthcare industry trends described above may create future acquisition opportunities  our future financial growth rates will be impacted by our ability to acquire hospitals and to successfully integrate them into our system

hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase with the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to paying standard hospital rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect our hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net operating revenue growth 
we continuously monitor the cost benefit relationship of services provided at our hospitals  and make decisions related to adding new services or discontinuing existing services 
net patient revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between our hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare  medicaid and other third party payor programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of our hospitals primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts  rentals and leases  and other operating expenses  principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  physician recruiting  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 

table of contents other revenue is primarily comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements  reimbursable expenses and miscellaneous other revenue items 
management and professional services revenue plus reimbursable expenses represented of revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits and reimbursable expenses

the increase in adjusted admissions was attributable  in part  to the addition of new doctors  of which are hospital based  in our communities in cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports also increased revenue in by million compared to a reduction in revenue in of million 
salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from in the decrease is primarily due to improvements resulting from continued implementation of our flexible staffing standards throughout our hospitals  which effectively matches labor with hospital volume trends and continued cost containment of employee benefit expenses 
purchased services  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily attributable to an reduction in contract labor and reductions in collection agency fees as we were less reliant on outside collection consultants and staffing 
provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in due primarily to the increase in bad debts resulting from increases in self pay revenue 
during  self pay revenue as a percentage of total gross revenues increased to from in the most significant increase occurred in the second quarter of when self pay revenue as a percentage of gross revenues increased to but then declined slightly in the third quarter to and continued to decline in the fourth quarter to 
the increase in self pay revenue is due to the current economic environment and slow employment recovery  coupled with changes in benefit plan design toward increased co pays and deductibles as employers pass a greater percentage of healthcare costs to individual employees 
net patient revenue associated with self pay patients are generally recorded at gross charges  which are higher than what government programs and managed care plans pay 
as a result  failure to receive payment from self pay and uninsured patients results in a higher provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total net patient revenue 
we are monitoring the self pay revenue category closely and expect provision for doubtful accounts expense to be in the of revenues range during the first six months of other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in primarily due to increased medical malpractice  workers compensation and directors and officers insurance cost of million and increased physician recruitment expense of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to depreciation at the two hospitals acquired in and capital expenditures 
interest expense increased to million in from million primarily due to the issuance in may of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  offset by repayments of outstanding borrowings on our senior bank credit facility  repurchases of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due and entering into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement during the third quarter of 
table of contents the write off of deferred loan costs and the gain resulting from repurchasing a portion of our convertible subordinated notes at a discount resulted in a net pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of million during the provision for income taxes totaled million  or a effective tax rate  in compared to million  or a effective tax rate  in the reduction in the effective tax rate during was primarily attributable to a million reduction in our tax liabilities due to the final and favorable resolution of examinations by taxing authorities as we recently concluded audits that have been ongoing for over one year 
for  we anticipate our effective tax rate to approximate  however  changing circumstances and regulations may result in a change in the actual effective tax rate 
in  the company s discontinued operations incurred an after tax impairment of assets charge of million and a loss from operations totaling million 
in  the discontinued operations achieved earnings from operations of million 
the decline in operations resulted primarily from a shift in the demographic make up of the service area surrounding glades general hospital and a significant increase in the proportion of indigent care provided by that facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports decreased revenues in by million and increased revenues in by million 
net patient revenue generated by the hospitals owned during both periods increased 
these hospitals also incurred a decline in inpatient admissions of  which was primarily attributable to the departure of physicians at the hospitals during total net patient revenue increased during  primarily related to the hospitals acquired in the fourth quarter of and during our operations were adversely affected by the loss of physicians 
during  we lost physicians who were major contributors  with the majority leaving in the last six months of the year 
we define a major contributor as a physician generating  or more in revenues annually 
all of these physicians left for reasons unrelated to hospital operations 
we recruited physicians in  of whom only started their practices in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
therefore  the new practices were unable to generate sufficient volume to replace the lost revenues generated by the departing physicians 
as the new physicians practices move along the timeline toward full  mature practices  lost revenues will be replaced 
of the recruited physicians  were admitting physicians 
based on historic practice patterns of physicians recruited to our hospitals  to date  these physician practices are tracking in line with historic trends and our expectations 
our operations were adversely impacted by increased competition from ambulatory surgery centers in two of our markets 
we have been proactive in the only other markets large enough to support full service ambulatory surgery centers that currently do not have these services  by either pursuing a certificate of need for a full service ambulatory surgery center ourselves or working with physicians in the market to address the community need for outpatient surgery services 
increases in expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts  rentals and leases and other operating expenses resulted primarily from new hospital acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and in the second quarter of and from the addition of new services and increased physician recruiting 
the consolidated provision for doubtful accounts decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in  primarily related to improvement in days in accounts receivable and increased up front cash collections 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisition of hospitals in and as previously mentioned and capital expenditures at hospitals owned during both periods  
table of contents offset by non amortization of goodwill in  which had an impact of approximately million 
interest expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this was a result of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of additional hospitals in the fourth quarter of and in  and interest on the million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes issued in october income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of in and in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
income from continuing operations was million  or of revenues  in  compared to million or of revenues  in in  income from discontinued operations totaled million compared to a loss of million in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital from continuing operations of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital from continuing operations of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million for the prior year  primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations 
cash used in investing activities was down significantly to million in  from million in  primarily due to the purchases of memorial hospital of martinsville and henry county in may  and los alamos medical center in june net cash used in financing activities totaled million in compared to million of net cash provided by financing activities during the same period last year 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the two hospital acquisitions 
during  we received million in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes due we used the proceeds  along with existing cash  to repay all amounts outstanding million on our senior credit facility and to repurchase million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due at december   we had million net of outstanding letters of credit available for borrowing under our senior credit facility 
in may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase from time to time and subject to market conditions of our convertible subordinated notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
of the million principal amount of the notes originally issued  we had million principal amount outstanding at december  additional repurchases  if any  will be made out of cash provided by operations 
we intend to acquire additional acute care facilities and are actively seeking out such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will not require additional debt or equity financing for any particular acquisition 
also  we continually review our capital needs and financing opportunities and may seek additional equity or debt financing for our acquisition program or other needs 
our shelf registration statement on form s  providing for the offer  from time to time  of common stock and debt securities up to an aggregate of million  remains effective 
following the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes in may  the shelf registration 
table of contents statement remains available for the issuance of up to million of additional securities  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
capital expenditures for our owned and leased hospitals may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the hospitals 
we expect to make total capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses or new hospital construction projects 
planned capital expenditures for consist principally of capital improvements to owned and leased hospitals 
we expect to incur approximately million in new hospital construction projects related to one hospital in bluffton  south carolina and one hospital in ft 
mohave  arizona 
we anticipate opening the south carolina hospital by the first quarter of and the arizona hospital in the second half of we are obligated to construct a new facility at our eunice  louisiana location contingent upon the existing facility meeting specified operating targets 
at december   the specified operating targets had not been met 
a replacement facility  if constructed  at eunice is estimated to cost approximately million 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our management anticipates that operations and amounts available under our senior credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months 
the following table reflects a summary of our obligations and commitments outstanding as of december  payments due by period less than year years years thereafter total in thousands contractual cash obligations long term debt capital lease obligations  with interest operating leases subtotal amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years thereafter total in thousands other commitments letters of credit construction and improvement commitments physician commitments subtotal total obligations and commitments represents the aggregate of our contractual obligations for advances to physicians as reflected in physician recruiting agreements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements starting on page f of this report 
amounts shown are calculated based on the full extent of the obligation set forth in the agreements  although the actual amount of such advances often depends on the financial performance of the physician s practice during the first year after relocating to the community 
in most cases  the amounts advanced under the agreements are significantly less than the contractual commitment 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and 
table of contents judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
the following represent the estimates that we consider most critical to our operating performance and involve the most complex assumptions and assessments 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payors and others is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which a balance remains after primary insurance has paid 
our policy with respect to estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts is to reserve of all self pay accounts receivable at days and of all self pay accounts at days 
our allowance for doubtful accounts increased  as a percentage of accounts receivable net of contractual adjustments  to in from in we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collections data and other analytical tools to support the basis for our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we perform hindsight procedures on historical collection and write off experience to determine the reasonableness of our policy for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that qualify for charity care under our guidelines 
charity care accounts are deducted from gross revenue and do not affect the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations  or deterioration in aging accounts receivable could result in a significant increase in this allowance 
allowance for contractual discounts the percentage of our net patient revenue derived from medicare  medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from our standard charges continues to be high 
for the year ended december   medicare  medicaid and discounted plan patients accounts for a combined of net patient revenue from continuing operations  compared to in the medicare and medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are often complex and subject to interpretation and adjustment 
we use an exhibit system to estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis  given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
we have invested significant human resources and information systems to improve the estimation process  however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
in addition  we reserve of all other payor class accounts receivable consisting of medicare  medicaid  and other insurance payors at days 
general and professional liability reserves we purchased a professional liability claims made reporting policy effective january  this coverage is subject to a million self insured retention per occurrence for general and professional liability and provides coverage up to million for claims incurred during the annual policy term 
this retention amount increases our exposure for claims occurring prior to december   and reported on or after january  due to the increased retention amount as compared to prior years 
in  the company had a claims made reporting policy subject to a  deductible and a million self insured retention per occurrence  providing coverage up to million for claims incurred during the annual policy term in in  we maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding  per medical incident  subject to an annual maximum of  for claims occurring and reported in we purchased a tail policy that provides an unlimited claim reporting period for our professional liability for claims incurred in and prior years 
we estimate our self insured retention portion of the malpractice risks using an outside actuary which uses historical claims data  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accrual for malpractice claims could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
the estimation process is also complicated by the relatively short period of time in which we have owned some of our healthcare facilities  as occurrence data under previous ownership may not necessarily reflect occurrence data under our ownership 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating our insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential 
table of contents outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in the estimates 
we maintain a reserve to cover both reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported within our self insured retention 
workers compensation reserves workers compensation claims are insured with a large deductible with stop loss limits of  per accident and a million and million minimum cap on total losses for the and years  respectively  and  per accident and a million and million minimum cap on total losses for the and years  respectively 
we increased our deductible loss amount to  per accident effective january  the minimum cap for total losses is million 
our arrangement with the insurance provider allows us to prepay the expected amounts of annual workers compensation claims  which is based upon claims experience 
the claims processor tracks payments for the policy year 
at the end of the policy year  the claims processor compares the total amount prepaid by us to the actual amount paid by the claims processor 
this comparison ultimately will result in a receivable from or a payable to the claims processor 
we are fully insured in the commercial marketplace for workers compensation claims prior to january  we utilize loss run reports provided by the claims administrator to determine the appropriate range of loss reserves for the and subsequent years 
our accruals are calculated to cover the risk from both reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
goodwill and long lived assets  including impairment our consolidated financial statements primarily include the following types of long lived assets property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment purchased in the normal course of business are recorded at the cost of the purchase and a useful life is assigned based upon the nature of the asset in comparison to our policy 
we also  in connection with our acquisition of businesses  acquire property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use outside firms to perform a valuation of these acquired assets for the purpose of allocating the purchase price of the acquisition 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we have obtained valuation reports to identify property and equipment  as well as any intangible assets purchased in our acquisitions 
based on the valuation reports completed to date  the only identifiable intangible assets valued have been non compete agreements and licenses and accreditations  which have had minimal associated value  the remainder was goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill resulting from acquisitions after june  has not been amortized 
impairment of goodwill is governed by sfas no 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we completed our transitional impairment test prior to june  as of the beginning of the results of our review indicated that no impairment was present related to the adoption of this accounting standard 
additionally  we completed our annual impairment test as of october  the results of our review indicated that no impairment occurred  other than for glades general hospital  as discussed below 
our annual impairment test is based upon a combination of market capitalization and a projected run rate for income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  interest  minority interests  loss on sale of assets and loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted for a multiple of earnings for the consolidated company 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated no impairment has occurred 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill is governed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted this statement effective january  in accordance with the standard  in connection with the proposed sale of glades general hospital  the company recorded an after tax impairment charge of million related to the write off of goodwill associated with the hospital  the write off of the net book value of physician recruiting costs and the write down of other long lived assets of the hospital to their net realizable value  less costs to sell 

table of contents inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along to us rising costs in the form of higher prices 
we generally have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  we do not know whether we will be able to offset or control future cost increases  or be able to pass on the increased costs associated with providing healthcare services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our policy is not to hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
our primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain of our debt at a fixed rate  either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into an interest rate swap 
at december   approximately of our outstanding debt was effectively at a fixed rate 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted  for a ten year period  million of the million fixed rate borrowings under our senior subordinated notes due to floating rate borrowings 
floating rate borrowings are based on libor plus over the term of the agreement 
our interest rate swap is a fair value hedge 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument 
we anticipate that the counterparty will fully satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the carrying amount of our total long term debt  less current maturities  of million and million at december  and  respectively  approximated fair value 
at the december  borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreement  would have no significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
