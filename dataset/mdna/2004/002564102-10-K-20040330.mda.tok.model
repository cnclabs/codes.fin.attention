item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview this discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the company s past performance  its financial condition and its prospects 
the company is a supplier of mainly safety related products to workers 
we operated seven fully stocked distribution facilities sales offices in the western and southwest part of the united states 
historically  the most reliable method of profitable growth has been opening new locations 
the significant decline in revenues in was unexpected and  although we remained profitable  we were not able to match our costs to those declining revenues as quickly 
our goals for are to produce top line growth as well as improved profitability 
geographic expansion as well as organic growth will be critical to our top line growth 
in addition  the company will need to further reduce costs to stay competitive 
approximately percent of our selling  general and administrative costs are in three categories labor related costs  rent and freight 
we plan to evaluate our staffing needs and benefit programs to ensure we have the best people in the industry and that they are compensated fairly 
in addition  we will review our facility leases as they renew and our fixed costs and attempt to do more with less space through the use of better logistics 
finally  we will review our negotiated deals with freight companies to ensure we are receiving the best service for the best price and pass on  where appropriate  the costs to our customers 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december   decreased percent to  from the abatix operating segment net sales declined percent to  in and the iesi operating segment net sales decreased percent to  in the decrease in revenue at the abatix operating segment is primarily attributable to the decline in insurance coverage related to molds in homes and buildings throughout the us in the texas insurance commission limited the insurance companies liability related to mold which would naturally decrease the number of mold related jobs performed by our customers 
at that time  the consensus from people in the industry was the backlog of mold related jobs was sufficient to last two years 
in actuality  the decline was more severe than anticipated 
between the fourth quarter and the second quarter  the company experienced a decline in mold remediation sales 
the decline in sales at the abatix operating segment was also attributed to the general us economic conditions and the real estate conditions in our local markets 
as the economy recovers  spending for new construction and production at industrial manufacturing facilities should improve and positively impact our business 
the decline in sales at iesi was primarily due to the loss of business at two large customers  partially offset by adding new customers during the year 
the loss of business resulted from one customer being purchased and the other customer losing a large contract which used iesi products 
the company entered the homeland security industry in late and invested a significant amount of resources to this market 
the private sector was projected to spend more than the public sector and with our ability to build relationships  we could capture a share of the private security dollars 
to date  the private sector has remained a small player in our portion of this industry 
the public sector has been the predominant customer  however most of their orders are bid upon by numerous suppliers 
while we have been active in the bidding of these products and have won several bids  these orders are generally at lower prices than the private sector 
we anticipate the private sector will spend more money on our products as the general economic conditions improve 
during the first quarter of  the company experienced some unexpected personnel turnover 
while this turnover will have a short term impact on our operations  the company has already taken appropriate action and hired replacements that should mitigate any long term issues 
gross profit for of  decreased percent from gross profit in due to decreased sales volume 
the company s gross profit margins  expressed as a percentage of sales  were approximately percent for and although overall margins are expected to remain at their current levels in  competitive pressures could negatively impact any and all efforts by the company to maintain or improve product margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for of  decreased percent over the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to decreased selling costs  primarily commissions  caused by the lower sales volume 
these expenses were percent and percent of sales for and  respectively 
due to the lower sales volume that occurred in  the company made several adjustments to its staffing levels during  the full impact of which will be included in however  many of the company s costs are fixed and unless some of these fixed costs are reduced or eliminated  selling  general and administrative expenses will be in the to percent range for interest expense of  decreased  from primarily due to lower interest rates and lower borrowings 
the company s credit facilities are variable rate notes tied to the lending institution s prime rate 
increases in the prime rate could negatively affect the company s earnings

year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december   increased percent to  from the abatix operating segment net sales grew percent to  in and the iesi operating segment net sales decreased percent to  in the increase in revenue at abatix was primarily attributable to the expanding awareness of toxic molds in homes and buildings throughout the us  partially offset by a decline in revenues to the construction and industrial manufacturing industries

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s working capital requirements  when sales are increasing  result from the growth of its accounts receivable and inventories and purchases of fixed assets 
to fund these requirements  the company uses earnings  net of non cash charges  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and borrowings from its lines of credit 
with a decline in sales  as in  the company s cash requirements result from purchases of property and equipment and repayments on its lines of credit 
to fund these requirements  the company uses its earnings  net of non cash charges  and its decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operations during of  resulted from net earnings adjusted for non cash charges and the decrease in accounts receivable resulting from the lower sales  partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses 
cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be positive  although at any given point  it may be negative 
the company s accounts receivable collection days and inventory turns have not fluctuated significantly over the past several years 
therefore  corresponding with the sales decline in  the accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  inventory have declined as well 
cash requirements for non operating activities during resulted primarily from the purchases of property and equipment 
in addition  the company was able to pay down its working capital line of credit as a result of the cash generated from collection of accounts receivable and lower inventory amounts 
the equipment purchases in were primarily related to the new computer system any new locations 
contractual obligations the following table presents the company s total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable in thousands 
total contractual obligations operating leases  working capital line of credit   equipment notes employment contracts computer system open purchase orders office equipment leases total contractual obligations  commentary the company s working capital line of credit agreement includes a feature that allows the bank to call the debt  therefore  the debt is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets and included above 
this line of credit contains no defined payment schedule 
the company s equipment notes are comprised of term notes of to months in length 
these term notes also have a call feature  and therefore are classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has employment agreements with two officers 
generally  these agreements cover two years  with the current agreement set to expire at the end of as part of the negotiation of the company s new computer system which was implemented on december   the company deferred payment of  until may  the open purchase orders represent amounts the company anticipates will become payable within the next year  primarily for saleable product 
the company is exploring geographic expansion for a new location would require approximately  in fixed asset purchases  comprised of computers  office furniture  warehouse racking and potentially a delivery vehicle 
in addition  cash will also be required to stock this location with product and to finance the customers purchases 
cash flow from operations and borrowings on our lines of credit will be used to finance any new location 
with the exception of opening locations  other fixed asset purchases anticipated for will include primarily replacement of computers  office furniture and delivery vehicles 
the company has an  working capital line of credit at a commercial lending institution 
the working capital line of credit agreement allows the company to borrow up to percent of the book value of eligible trade receivables plus the lesser of percent of eligible inventory or  as of march   there are advances outstanding under this credit facility of  based on the borrowing formula  calculated as of february   the company had the capacity to borrow up to  the company also maintains a  capital equipment credit facility providing for borrowings at percent of cost on purchases 
the advances outstanding under this credit facility as of march   were  both credit facilities are payable on demand and bear a variable rate of interest tied to the prime rate 
management believes the company s current credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event the company pursues acquisitions or a more aggressive growth strategy  it will most likely be unable to use its common stock as payment or as a source of cash 
therefore  the company might need to negotiate with a lender to secure additional borrowings to be used to achieve those plans 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the board in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the company 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends statement no 
and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement no 
also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
statement no 
permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method 
these methods allow companies to avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value based method 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this statement has had no impact on the company 
on january   the fasb issued interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires disclosure of guarantees 
it also requires liability recognition for the fair value of guarantees made after december  the adoption of fin has had no impact on the company 
in may  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
statement no 
requires that certain instruments classified as part of stockholders equity or between stockholders equity and liabilities be classified as liabilities 
in october  the fasb deferred indefinitely a provision of this statement that would have required certain minority interests in less than percent owned subsidiaries to be classified as liabilities 
the company has no instruments that would be affected by statement no 
in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  fin r 
fin r requires consolidation of entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary  despite not having voting control 
likewise  it does not permit consolidation of entities in which the company has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary 
the adoption of fin r has had no impact on the company 
critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain policies require the company to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions  which are sensitive to deviations from actual results 
in particular  the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the use of long lived assets in assessing potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
since there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate the carrying value of long lived assets were impaired  the company recorded no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets 
the company does not expect events or circumstances to significantly change  thereby affecting the carrying value of long lived assets 
in addition  the company has estimated the net realizable value of accounts receivable by evaluating the current pool of accounts receivable in light of past experience and current knowledge of its customer base 
the company believes the reserves recorded in the financial statements are adequate for potential credit losses 
it is possible the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time or if the health of the economy or the markets served by the company deteriorates 
the company also evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s working capital and equipment lines of credit are variable rate notes  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s debt at december  and  an increase of basis points in the united states prime rate would have negatively impacted the company s net earnings for the years then ended by  and  respectively 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this form k are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following an attack similar to the one of september   the long term impact of insurance coverage on mold remediation jobs  adverse weather conditions  inability to hire and train quality people or retain current personnel  changes in interest rates or strong competition 
in addition  increases in oil prices or shortages in oil supply could significantly impact the company s petroleum based products and its ability to supply those products at a reasonable price
