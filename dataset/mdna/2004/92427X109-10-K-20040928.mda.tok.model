critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below inventory valuation the company carries its inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on future operating results and financial position 
providing for litigation contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by differences between the company s assumptions related to these proceedings and actual results 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
returns and allowances provision the company accrues a provision for returns and allowances 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust this provision based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that the provision is estimated properly 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to the provision may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on future operating results and financial position 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the company acquired calyx corolla  inc on august  this acquisition resulted in  of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company will test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually 
the company expects to complete its impairment testing as of june  management s estimates of market values  projections of future cash flows and other factors are significant factors in testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
if these estimates or projections change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on future operating results and financial position 
income tax provision the company provides for income taxes at rates equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  however  certain estimates are made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities and other income tax liabilities could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period

these statements  which address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet entities  require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities 
certain provisions of fin r related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended december  the company must apply fin r to its interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first annual period ending after march  adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds 
under its current policies  the company does not use market rate sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a ten percent fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its financial obligations
