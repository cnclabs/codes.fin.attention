item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
expand network of service centers 
we believe that our site services division has a competitive advantage when service centers are located near a tsdf 
we now have tsdfs and service or support centers 
by opening additional service centers close to the tsdfs we now operate  we believe that we can  with minimal expenditure of funds  increase our market share of site services 
much of the additional waste that is generated can be sent to existing facilities at competitive transportation costs to increase the utilization of the plants and thereby increase their profitability 
penetrate the industrial maintenance services market 
in  we added to our service offerings industrial cleaning and maintenance 
we believe that industrial maintenance services offer significant 
table of contents opportunities for growth for us because of the multi billion dollar size of the market and our small current penetration of this market 
the expansion in industrial maintenance services leverages our hazardous waste disposal assets because hazardous wastes are often removed in the cleaning process 
improve utilization of existing waste facilities 
we have a network of active hazardous waste management properties 
services offered at these properties include five incineration facilities  nine commercial landfills  seven wastewater treatment operations  treatment  storage and disposal facilities  and seven locations specializing in pcb management or oil storage and recycling 
some properties offer multiple capabilities 
these facilities represent a substantial investment in permits  plants and equipment 
this network of facilities provides us with significant operating leverage 
there are opportunities to expand waste handling capacity at these facilities by modifying the terms of the existing permits and by adding capital equipment and new technology 
through selected permit modifications  we can expand the range of treatment services we offer to our customers without the large capital investment necessary to acquire or build new waste management facilities 
develop new waste management services 
industrial waste generators are demanding alternatives to traditional waste disposal methods in order to increase recycling and reclamation and to minimize the end disposal of hazardous waste 
we utilize our technological expertise and innovation to improve and expand the range of services we offer to our customers  and to develop less expensive methods of disposing of hazardous waste 
capitalize on industry consolidation 
we believe that our large industrial customers increasingly require a comprehensive range of environmental services including site and facility decontamination  industrial maintenance services  emergency response services  technical services  waste consulting and information management services to be provided by a select number of service providers 
this trend should place smaller operators at a competitive disadvantage due to their size and limited financial resources 
to respond to our customers needs  we have increased the range of environmental services we offer 
we continue to evaluate other business opportunities in order to enhance service to our existing customer base and expand our customer base 
in addition  we seek acquisitions within our existing areas of operation in order to obtain incremental market share 
provide e commerce solutions 
we enhanced our internet functionality to provide order fulfillment  waste profiling and transportation scheduling 
we believe our e commerce capabilities are superior to those of our competitors in the environmental services industry and that increasing the percentage of transactions that utilize e commerce will result in lower costs of services 
industry the hazardous waste industry was created in with the passage of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
these congressional regulations became effective in  requiring waste generators to distinguish between hazardous and non hazardous wastes  and to treat  store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations 
this new regulatory environment  combined with strong economic growth  increased corporate concern surrounding environmental liabilities  and early stage industry dynamics contributed to a rapid growth in the hazardous waste industry 
initial entrants into the hazardous waste industry realized high profit margins  which attracted a wave of new competition  expanded the industry s capacity and created an excess supply of services 
this overcapacity coincided with the waste minimization efforts of large waste generators  leading to a subsequent decline in prices  operating margins and profits 
because of recent industry consolidation  new regulations and facility closures  we expect pricing in the industry will stabilize or improve  but we can not predict when pricing will stabilize or improve 
the largest generators of hazardous waste materials are companies in the chemical and petrochemical  primary metals  paper  furniture  aerospace and pharmaceutical industries 
automotive manufacturers and suppliers  electrical  oil and gas companies are also significant generators of hazardous waste 
many large companies and institutions that produce large amounts of hazardous waste treat or reclaim a large percentage of their own wastes internally as part of the manufacturing process or recycling efforts 

table of contents the collection and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local  state  provincial and federal requirements  which regulate health  safety  the environment  zoning and land use 
in the united states  the epa as well as various other federal  state and local environmental  health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations 
included in these regulations are the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla 
as part of cercla  generators and transporters of hazardous substances  as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a release of hazardous substances  are made strictly  jointly and severally liable for the clean up costs resulting from releases and threatened releases of cercla regulated hazardous substances 
canadian companies are regulated under the canadian environmental protection act and specific provincial environmental regulations 
in general  these regulations establish requirements controlling releases to air  land and water  provide for worker protection and control the transportation of hazardous waste and materials 
each province has legislation and regulations designed to control hazardous waste generation  management and disposal 
movement of hazardous waste between canada and the united states is subject to the canada usa agreement on trans border movement of hazardous waste 
canada is a signatory to the basel convention  which governs international and some domestic activities of signatories 
in canada  responsibility and liability of the waste passes from the generator to the transporter or receiver of the waste  contrary to provisions of cercla in the united states 
services we provide a wide range of environmental services which we manage as two major segments technical services and site services 
technical services include treatment and disposal of industrial wastes  which includes physical treatment  resource recovery and fuels blending  incineration  landfills  wastewater treatment  lab chemical disposal and explosives management  collection  transportation and logistics management  specialized packaging  transportation and disposal of laboratory chemicals and household hazardous wastes  which are referred to as cleanpack services  and apollo onsite services  which provides outsourced environmental programs management at customer sites 
these services are provided through a network of service centers where a fleet of trucks  rail or other transport is dispatched to pick up customers waste either on a pre determined schedule or on demand  and then to deliver waste to a permitted facility 
from the service centers  chemists can also be dispatched to a customer location for the collection of chemical waste for disposal 
site services provide highly skilled experts utilizing specialty equipment and resources to perform services  such as industrial maintenance  surface remediation  groundwater restoration  site and facility decontamination  emergency response  site remediation  transformer decommissioning  and oil disposal 
we market these services through our sales organizations and  in many instances services in one area of the business support or lead to work in other service lines 

table of contents the table below shows for each of the three years in the three year period ended december  the total revenues contributed by our principal lines of business in thousands years ended december  technical services site services other additional segment information can be found in the financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
technical services treatment and disposal we transport  treat and dispose of industrial wastes for commercial and industrial customers  health care providers  educational and research organizations  other environmental services companies and governmental entities 
the wastes handled include substances  which are classified as hazardous because of their corrosive  ignitable  infectious  reactive or toxic properties  and other substances subject to federal and state environmental regulation 
we provide final treatment and disposal services designed to manage hazardous and non hazardous wastes  which cannot be otherwise economically recycled or reused 
we operate a network of tsdfs that primarily focus on the collection of waste from smaller to mid size generators 
the tsdfs collect  temporarily store and or consolidate compatible waste streams for more efficient transportation to final recycling  treatment or disposal destinations 
tsdfs in the united states have part b permits under rcra that  among other things  allow us to store waste for up to one year for bulking  treatment or transfer purposes 
larger customers typically ship directly to the end disposal sites with full truckloads of material 
depending upon the content  the material collected at the tsdfs is either disposed of at our incineration  landfill or wastewater treatment facilities  disposed of at end disposal facilities not owned by us or recycled 
waste types processed or transferred in drums or bulk quantities include flammables  combustibles and other organics  acids and caustics  cyanides and sulfides  solids and sludges  industrial wastewaters  items containing pcbs  such as utility transformers and electrical light ballasts  medical waste  other regulated wastes  and non hazardous industrial waste 
we receive a detailed waste profile sheet prepared by our customer to document the nature of the waste 
a sample of the delivered waste is tested to ensure that it conforms to the customer s waste profile record and to select an appropriate method of treatment and disposal 
once the wastes are characterized  compatible wastes are consolidated to achieve economies in storage  handling  transportation and ultimate treatment and disposal 
at the time of acceptance of a customer s waste at our facility  a unique computer bar code identification label is assigned to each container of waste  enabling us to use sophisticated computer systems to track and document the status  location and disposition of the waste 

table of contents physical treatment 
physical treatment methods include distillation  separation and stabilization 
these methods are used to reduce the volume or toxicity of waste material or to make it suitable for further treatment  reuse  or disposal 
distillation uses either heat or vacuum to purify liquids for resale 
separation utilizes techniques such as sedimentation  filtration  flocculation and centrifugation to remove solid materials from liquids 
stabilization refers to a category of waste treatment processes designed to reduce contaminant mobility or solubility and convert waste to a more chemically stable form 
stabilization technology includes many classes of immobilization systems and applications 
stabilization is a frequent treatment method for metal bearing wastes received at several of our facilities  which treat the waste to meet specific federal land disposal restrictions 
after treatment  the waste is tested to confirm that it has been rendered non hazardous 
it can then be sent to a non hazardous waste landfill  at significantly lower cost than disposal at a hazardous waste landfill 
resource recovery and fuels blending 
resource recovery involves the treatment of wastes using various methods  which effectively remove contaminants from the original material to restore its fitness for its intended purpose and to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal 
we operate treatment systems for the reclamation and reuse of certain wastes  particularly solvent based wastes generated by industrial cleaning operations  metal finishing and other manufacturing processes 
spent solvents that can be recycled are processed through thin film evaporators and other processing equipment and are distilled into usable products 
upon recovery of these products  we either return the recovered solvents to the original generator or sell them to third parties 
organic liquids and solids with sufficient heat value are blended to meet strict specifications for use as supplemental fuels for incinerators  cement kilns  industrial furnaces and other high efficiency boilers 
we have installed fuels blending equipment at some tsdfs to prepare these supplemental fuels 
when possible  we burn fuel blended material at our incinerators 
otherwise  we send the fuel blended material to supplemental fuel users that are licensed to accept the blended fuel material 
although we pay a fee to the users who accept this product  this disposal method is substantially less costly than other disposal methods 
incineration 
incineration is the preferred method for the treatment of organic hazardous waste  because it effectively destroys the contaminants at temperatures in excess of  degrees fahrenheit 
high temperature incineration effectively eliminates organic wastes such as herbicides  halogenated solvents  pesticides  and pharmaceutical and refinery wastes  regardless of whether they are gases  liquids  sludges or solids 
federal and state incineration regulations require a destruction and removal efficiency of for most organic wastes and for pcbs and dioxin 
we have five active incineration facilities that offer a wide range of technological capabilities to customers through this network 
in the united states  we operate a fluidized bed thermal oxidation unit for maximum destruction efficiency of hazardous waste with an annual capacity of  tons  two solids and liquids capable incineration facilities with a combined estimated annual capacity of  tons 
we also operate two hazardous waste liquid injection incinerators in canada with total annual capacity of approximately  tons 
our incineration facilities in kimball  nebraska  deer park  texas and aragonite  utah are designed to process liquid organic wastes  sludges  solids  soil and debris 
the deer park facility has two kilns and a rotary reactor 
our incineration facilities in kimball  nebraska and deer park  texas have on site landfills for the disposal of ash and other waste material produced as a result of the incineration process 
our incineration facilities in mercier  quebec and sarnia  ontario are liquid injection incinerators  designed primarily for the destruction of liquid organic waste 
typical waste streams include wastewater with low levels of organics and other higher concentration organic liquid wastes not amenable to conventional physical or chemical waste treatment 
the north american hazardous waste incineration market is now served by a total of major incineration facilities operated by a total of companies 
we own of these active incineration facilities and offers a wide 
table of contents range of technological capabilities to our customers through this network 
the primary competitors in the incineration market are onyx a subsidiary of a foreign company  veolia environnement nyse ve  teris  llc a subsidiary of a foreign company  suez lyonnaise des eaux  von roll america wti a joint venture  and ross incineration services  inc a private company landfills 
landfills are used primarily for the disposal of inorganic wastes 
in the united states and canada  we operate nine commercial landfills 
seven commercial landfills are designed and permitted for the disposal of hazardous wastes and two landfills are operated for non hazardous industrial waste disposal and  to a lesser extent  municipal solid waste 
of the seven commercial landfills used for disposal of hazardous waste  five are located in the united states  and two are located in canada 
as of december   the useful economic lives for accounting purposes of these landfills include approximately million cubic yards of remaining capacity 
this estimate of the useful economic lives of these landfills includes permitted airspace and unpermitted airspace that management believes to be probable of being permitted based on our analysis of various factors 
in addition to the capacity included in the useful economic lives of these landfills  there are approximately million cubic yards of additional unpermitted airspace capacity included in the footprints of these landfills that may ultimately be permitted 
there can be no assurance that this unpermitted additional capacity will be permitted 
in addition to our hazardous waste landfill sites  we operate two non hazardous industrial landfills with  cubic yards of remaining permitted capacity 
these two facilities are located in the united states and have been issued operating permits under the authority of subtitle d of rcra 
prior to issuance of a permit  we must demonstrate to the permitting agency that our non hazardous industrial landfills have  and we must subsequently employ  operational programs protective of the integrity of the landfill  human health and the surrounding environment 
our non hazardous landfill facilities are permitted to accept commercial industrial waste  including wastes from foundries  demolition and construction  machine shops  automobile manufacturing  printing  metal fabrications and recycling 
the commercial hazardous landfill sector is one of the most consolidated in the hazardous treatment and disposal industry 
the north american hazardous waste landfill disposal market is serviced by facilities owned by a total of companies 
while most of these companies operate two or fewer facilities  we and waste management inc have a significant share of the north american market 
other competitors include envirosource  inc  american ecology corp  eq and stablex canada 
wastewater treatment 
we operate wastewater treatment facilities that offer a range of wastewater treatment technologies 
our wastewater treatment operations involve processing hazardous and non hazardous wastes through the use of physical and chemical treatment methods 
the solid waste materials produced by these wastewater processing operations are then disposed of at facilities which are owned by us  or at off site facilities owned and operated by unrelated businesses  while the treated effluent is discharged to the local sewer system under permit 
our wastewater treatment facilities treat a broad range of industrial liquid and semi liquid wastes containing heavy metals  organics and suspended solids  including acids and caustics  ammonias  sulfides and cyanides  heavy metals  ink wastes and plating solutions  landfill leachates and scrubber waters  and oily wastes and water soluble coolants 
wastewater treatment can be economical as well as environmentally sound  by combining different wastewaters in a batching process that reduces costs for multiple waste stream disposal 
for instance  acidic waste from one source can be neutralized with alkaline from a second source to produce a neutral solution

services include management of drum  bulk and lab pack quantities of hazardous and non hazardous wastes  specialized environmental labor  management of waste from source to final destination  chemical consolidation  bulking and packaging  solid waste management  transportation and logistics for offsite disposal  and inspection of satellite and day storage facilities 
the apollo onsite program leverages our transportation and disposal assets by providing incremental volumes to process at our facilities 
site services we provide a wide range of environmental site services to maintain industrial facilities and process equipment  as well as clean up or contain actual or threatened releases of hazardous materials into the environment 
these services are provided primarily to large chemical  petroleum  transportation  utility  industrial waste management companies and governmental agencies 
our strategy is to identify  evaluate  and solve our customers environmental problems  on a planned or emergency basis  by providing a comprehensive interdisciplinary response to the specific requirements of each project 
industrial maintenance 
many of our customers have a recurring need to clean equipment and facilities periodically in order to continue operations  maintain and improve operating efficiencies of their plants  and satisfy safety requirements 
industrial maintenance involves chemical cleaning  hydroblasting  vacuuming  and other methods to remove deposits from process equipment  such as paint booths and plating lines  and storage facilities for material used in the manufacturing or production process  such as feedstocks  chemicals  fuels  paints  oils  inks  metals and many other items 
our service centers are equipped with special equipment  such as high volume pumps  pressure washers  nonsparking and chemical resistant tools  and a variety of personal protective equipment  to perform maintenance services quickly  usually during off periods to minimize the customer s production downtime 
surface remediation 
surface remediation projects arise in two principal areas the planned cleanup of hazardous waste sites and the cleanup of accidental spills and discharges of hazardous materials  such as those resulting from transportation and industrial accidents 
in addition  some surface remediation projects involve the cleanup and maintenance of industrial lagoons  ponds and other surface impoundments on a recurring basis 
in all of these cases  an extremely broad range of hazardous substances may be encountered 
surface remediation projects generally require considerable interaction among technical and project management services 
following the selection of the preferred remedial alternative  the project team identifies the processes and equipment for cleanup 
simultaneously  our health and safety staff develops a site safety plan for the project 
remedial approaches usually include physical removal  mechanical de watering and stabilization  or encapsulation 
groundwater restoration 
our groundwater restoration services typically involve response to above ground spills  leaking underground tanks and lines  hazardous waste landfills  and leaking surface impoundments 
groundwater restoration efforts often require complex recovery systems  including recovery drains or wells  air strippers  biodegradation or carbon filtration systems  and containment barriers 
these systems and technologies can be used individually or in combination to remove a full range of floating or dissolved organic compounds from groundwater 
we design and fabricate mobile or fixed site groundwater treatment systems 

table of contents site and facility decontamination 
site and facility decontamination involves the cleanup and restoration of buildings  equipment  and other sites and facilities that have been contaminated by exposure to hazardous materials during a manufacturing process  or by fires  process malfunctions  spills or other accidents 
our projects have included decontamination of electrical generating stations  electrical and electronics components  transformer vaults  and commercial  educational  industrial  laboratory  research and manufacturing facilities 
emergency response 
we undertake environmental remediation projects on both a planned and emergency basis 
emergency response actions may develop into planned remedial action projects when soil  groundwater  buildings or facilities are extensively contaminated by hazardous chemicals or etiological agents 
we have established specially trained emergency response teams which operate on a hour basis from their service centers 
we have also established a program called cleaner  which is a sub contractor network responding to emergency response actions 
many of our remediation activities result from a response to an emergency situation by one of our response teams 
these incidents can result from accidents involving chemical substances  fires at chemical facilities or hazardous waste sites  transformer fires or explosions involving pcbs  infections or etiological diseases such as anthrax  and other unanticipated developments when the substances involved pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment  such as possible groundwater contamination 
emergency response projects require trained personnel  equipped with protective gear and specialized equipment  prepared to respond promptly whenever these situations occur 
to meet the staffing requirements for emergency response projects  we rely in part upon a network of trained personnel who are available on a contract basis for specific project assignments 
our health and safety specialists and other skilled personnel assist field managers in supervising these projects during and subsequent to the cleanup 
the steps performed by us include rapid response  containment and control procedures  analytical testing and assessment  neutralization and treatment  collection  and transportation of the substances to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility 
site remediation 
we provide technical capabilities and operational expertise to manage large scale environmental projects 
the interdisciplinary teams of managers  geologists  chemists  engineers  scientists  technicians  and compliance experts design and implement solution oriented remedial programs incorporating both off site and on site treatment 
the areas of expertise include remedial investigations  remediation technologies design  in house fabrication  installation  and operations and maintenance  decontamination and decommissioning operations  high hazard materials handling  and mobile treatment services 
pcb disposal 
we remove pcbs and metals from pcb contaminated electrical equipment and reclaim the oil at our facilities

customers can create  submit  edit and view their waste profiles  automatically receive quarterly waste tracking reports  and have the ability to view  print or download signed manifests 
additionally  they can view collection schedules and place orders over the internet 

table of contents personnel training 
we provide comprehensive personnel training programs for our own employees and for our customers on a commercial basis 
such programs are designed to promote safe work practices under potentially hazardous conditions  whether or not toxic chemicals are present  in compliance with stringent regulations promulgated under rcra and the federal occupational safety and health act osha 
our technical training center includes confined space entry  exit and extraction equipment  an air system demonstration maze  respirator fit testing room  leak and spill response equipment  and a layout of a mock decontamination zone  all designed to fulfill the requirements of osha hazardous waste and emergency response standards 
seasonality and cyclical nature of business our operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities 
typically during the first quarter of each year there is less demand for environmental services due to the cold weather  particularly in the northern and midwestern united states and canada 
the main reason for this effect is reduced volumes of waste being received at our facilities and higher operating costs associated with operating in sub freezing weather and high levels of snowfall 
in addition  factory closings for the year end holidays reduce the volume of industrial waste generated  which results in lower volumes of waste handled by us during the first quarter of the following year 
the hazardous and industrial waste management business is cyclical to the extent that it is dependent upon a stream of waste from cyclical industries such as the chemical and petrochemical  primary metals  paper  furniture  aerospace and pharmaceutical industries 
if the business of those cyclical industries slows significantly  the revenues that we obtain from those industries is likely to slow 
customers our principal customers are utility  chemical  petroleum  petrochemical  pharmaceutical  transportation and industrial firms  educational institutions  other environmental service companies and government agencies 
our sales efforts are directed toward establishing and maintaining relationships with businesses which have ongoing requirements for one or more of our services 
our customer list includes many of the largest industrial companies in the united states 
we believe that our diverse customer base  in terms of number  industry and geographic location  as well as our large presence in north america  provides us with a recurring revenue base 
a majority of our revenues are derived from previously served customers with recurring needs for the our services 
for the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
we believe the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
under applicable us environmental laws and regulations  generators of hazardous wastes retain legal liability for the proper handling of those wastes up to and including their ultimate disposal 
in response to these potential concerns  many large generators of industrial wastes and other purchasers of waste management services such as general contractors on major remediation projects have decreased the number of providers they use for such services 
we have been selected as an approved vendor by large generators because we possess comprehensive collection  recycling  treatment  transportation  disposal  and waste tracking capabilities and have the expertise necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
by becoming an approved vendor for a large waste generator or other purchaser  we become eligible to provide waste management services to the multiple plants and projects of each generator or purchaser located in our service areas 
however  in order to obtain such approved vendor status  it may be necessary for us to bid against other qualified competitors in terms of the services and pricing to be provided 
furthermore  large generators or other purchasers of waste management services often periodically audit our facilities and operations to ensure that our waste management services are being performed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and other criteria established by us and such customers 

table of contents geographical information for the year ended december   we derived approximately million or of our revenues from customers located in the united states and puerto rico  approximately million or of our revenues from customers located in canada and less than of our revenues from customers in mexico 
prior to the acquisition of the csd assets effective september   we derived substantially all of our revenues from environmental services provided to customers located in the united states and puerto rico 
following the acquisition of the csd assets  we derived approximately million or of our revenue from customers located in canada 
as of december   we had property  plant and equipment  net of depreciation and amortization of approximately million  and permits and other intangible assets of million 
of these totals  approximately million or of long lived assets and million or of permits and other intangible assets were in canada  with the balance being in the united states and puerto rico except for insignificant assets in mexico 
competitive conditions the hazardous and industrial waste management industry  in which we compete  is highly competitive 
the sources of competition vary by locality and by type of service rendered  with competition coming from the other major waste services companies and hundreds of privately owned firms which offer waste services 
we compete against three major companies  which are philip services corp  onyx environmental services  a division of veolia environnement and waste management  inc we also compete against regional waste management companies and numerous small companies 
each of these competitors is able to provide one or more of the environmental services offered by us 
in addition  we compete with many firms engaged in the transportation  brokerage and disposal of hazardous wastes through recycling  waste derived fuels programs  thermal treatment or landfilling 
the principal methods of competition for all our services are price  quality  reliability of service rendered and technical proficiency in handling industrial and hazardous wastes properly 
we believe that we offer a more comprehensive range of environmental services than our competitors in major portions of our service territory  that our ability to provide comprehensive services supported by unique information technologies capable of managing the customers overall environmental program constitutes a significant competitive advantage  and that our stable ownership allows us to focus on building long term relationships with our customers

we believe that our ability to collect and transport waste products efficiently  quality of service  safety  and pricing are the most significant factors in the market for treatment and disposal services 
in site services  cleanpack and onsite services  our competitors include several major national and regional environmental services firms  as well as numerous smaller local firms 
we believe that availability of skilled technical professional personnel  quality of performance  diversity of services and price are the key competitive factors in this service industry 
in the united states  the original generators of hazardous waste remain liable under federal and state environmental laws for improper disposal of such wastes 
even if waste generators employ companies that have proper permits and licenses  knowledgeable customers are interested in the reputation and financial strength of the companies they use for management of their hazardous wastes 
we believe that our technical proficiency and reputation are important considerations to our customers in selecting and continuing to utilize our services 
compliance health safety we regard compliance with applicable environmental regulations and the health and safety of our workforce as critical components of our overall operations 
we strive to maintain the highest professional standards in our compliance  and health and safety activities  our internal operating requirements are in many instances more

we adhere to a risk management program designed to reduce potential liabilities to us and to our customers 
intellectual property we have invested significantly in the development of proprietary technology and also to establish and maintain an extensive knowledge of the leading technologies and incorporate these technologies into the environmental services that we offer and provide to our customers 
we currently hold a total of patents and trademarks in the united states  and we license software and other intellectual property from various third parties 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to our software documentation and other proprietary information 
we believe that we hold adequate rights to all intellectual property used in our business and that we do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights held by other parties 
management of risks we adhere to a program of risk management policies and practices designed to reduce potential liability  as well as to manage customers ongoing environmental exposures 
this program includes installation of risk management systems at our facilities  such as fire suppression  employee training  environmental auditing and 
table of contents policy decisions restricting the types of wastes handled 
we evaluate all revenue opportunities and decline those that we believe involve unacceptable risks 
we dispose waste at our incineration  wastewater treatment and landfill facilities  or at facilities owned and operated by other firms that we have audited and approved 
typically  we apply established technologies to the treatment  storage and recovery of hazardous wastes 
we believe our operations are conducted in a safe and prudent manner and in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
insurance and financial assurance our insurance programs cover the potential risks associated with our multifaceted operations from two primary exposures direct physical damage and third party liability 
we maintain a casualty insurance program providing coverage for vehicles  employer s liability and commercial general liability in the aggregate amount of million  million and million respectively per year  subject to a retention of million per occurrence 
we also have workers compensation insurance whose limits are established by state statutes 
since the early s  casualty insurance policies have typically excluded liability for pollution  which is covered under a separate pollution liability program 
we have pollution liability insurance policies covering our potential risk in three areas as a contractor performing services at customer sites  as a transporter of waste and for waste processing at our facilities 
we have contractor s liability insurance of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  covering off site remedial activities and associated liabilities 
steadfast insurance company a unit of zurich insurance na provides pollution liability coverage for waste in transit with single occurrence and aggregate liability limits of million 
this steadfast policy covers liability in excess of million for pollution caused by sudden and accidental occurrences during transportation of waste  from the time waste is picked up from a customer until its delivery to the final disposal site 
federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat  store or dispose of hazardous waste 
rcra and the toxic substances control act and comparable state hazardous waste regulations typically require hazardous waste handling facilities to maintain pollution liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate for sudden occurrences  and million per occurrence and million in the aggregate for non sudden occurrences 
we have a policy from steadfast insurance company insuring our treatment  storage and disposal activities that meets the regulatory requirements 
in addition  this policy provides excess limits above the regulatory requirements up to million 
under our insurance programs  coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposures  as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
it is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to employee benefit  workers compensation  commercial general and vehicle liability 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims 
we believe that policy cancellation terms are similar to those of other companies in other industries 
operators of hazardous waste handling facilities are also required by federal and state regulations to provide financial assurance for closure and post closure care of those facilities should the facilities cease operation 
closure would include the cost of removing the waste stored at a facility which ceased operating and sending the material to another facility for disposal and the cost of performing certain procedures for decontamination of the facilities 
total closure and post closure financial assurance required by regulators is approximately million 
we have placed most of the required financial assurance for closure through a qualified insurance company  which per terms of the policy required us to provide million of letters of credit as collateral 
we utilize our captive insurance company to provide financial assurance for the lagoons located at our chicago facility 

table of contents our ability to continue conducting our industrial waste management operations could be adversely affected if we should become unable to obtain sufficient insurance or surety bonds to meet our business and regulatory requirements in the future 
the availability of insurance may also be influenced by developments within the insurance industry  although other businesses in the environmental services industry would likely be similarly impacted by such developments 
environmental regulation while our business has benefited substantially from increased governmental regulation of hazardous waste transportation  storage and disposal  the environmental services industry itself has become the subject of extensive and evolving regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
we are required to obtain federal  state  provincial and local permits  or approvals for each of our hazardous waste facilities 
such permits are difficult to obtain and  in many instances  extensive studies  tests  and public hearings are required before the approvals can be issued 
we have acquired all operating permits and approvals now required for the current operation of our business  and have applied for or are in the process of applying for  all permits and approvals needed in connection with continued operation and planned expansion or modifications of our operations 
we make a continuing effort to anticipate regulatory  political and legal developments that might affect our operations  but are not always able to do so 
we cannot predict the extent to which any environmental legislation or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations 
federal regulation of hazardous waste the most significant federal environmental laws affecting us are the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the toxic substances control act tsca 
rcra 
rcra is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation  treatment  transportation  storage and disposal 
pursuant to rcra  the epa has established a comprehensive  cradle to grave system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous waste 
states that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the epa  have been delegated authority by the epa to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the epa s program 
every facility that treats  stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a rcra permit from the epa or an authorized state agency  unless a specific exemption exists  and must comply with certain operating requirements 
under rcra  hazardous waste management facilities in existence on november  were required to submit a preliminary permit application to the epa  the so called part a application 
by virtue of this filing  a facility obtained interim status  allowing it to operate until licensing proceedings are instituted pursuant to more comprehensive and exacting regulations the part b permitting process 
interim status facilities may continue to operate pursuant to the part a application until their part b permitting process is concluded 
rcra requires that part b permits contain provisions for required on site study and cleanup activities  known as corrective action  including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental liabilities for a discussion of our environmental liabilities 
see insurance and financial assurance above for a discussion of our financial assurance requirements 
the superfund act 
the superfund act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties 
it also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the epa to releases of hazardous substances into the 
table of contents environment  and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order persons responsible for any such release to perform any necessary cleanup 
the statute assigns joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs  including the cost of damage to natural resources  to the parties involved in the generation  transportation and disposal of such hazardous substances 
under the statute  we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance which is released into the environment  or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
see item  legal proceedings for a description of certain such proceedings involving us 
the clean air act 
the clean air act was passed by congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride  or criteria pollutants  such as carbon monoxide 
in  congress amended the clean air act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards 
these amendments also require the epa to promulgate regulations  which i control emissions of hazardous air pollutants  ii create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to rcra operating permits  iii mandate the phase out of ozone depleting chemicals  and iv provide for enhanced enforcement 
the clean air act requires epa  working with the states  to develop and implement regulations  which result in the reduction of volatile organic compound voc emissions and emissions of nitrogen oxides nox in order to meet certain ozone air quality standards specified by the clean air act 
in late  texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc enacted new clean air act regulations dealing with the monitoring and control of emissions of nox and vocs 
these new regulations were required because of a revision in the designation of the houston metropolitan area from a serious ozone non attainment area to a severe ozone non attainment area 
this new designation will require our deer park  texas incineration facility to further reduce emissions of nox 
nox emissions contribute to the formation of ground level ozone  which can be harmful to human health and the environment 
the interim standards of the hazardous waste combustor maximum achievable control technology the hwc mact rule of the clean air act amendments  promulgated on february   are identical to the technology based emission standards originally promulgated on september  these rules established new emission limits and operational controls on all new and existing incinerators  cement kilns  industrial boilers and light weight aggregate kilns that burn hazardous waste derived fuel 
facilities subject to the hwc mact rule were required to comply with the new emission standards by september   or they could apply for an extension with compliance being required by september  as further discussed below under compliance with environmental regulations  we have spent and will be required to expend significant funds in order to bring our deer park  texas and aragonite  utah incineration facilities into compliance with the new rules 
we believe that some facilities owned by others may not find it economical to upgrade to the new standards  which could result in the closure of some facilities 
this could result in a reduction of incineration capacity and lead to improved pricing for incineration 
however  no assurance can be given that this will happen 
clean water act 
this legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the united states without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources  including disposal sites and treatment facilities 
the epa has promulgated pretreatment regulations under the clean water act  which establish pretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works potw 
in the course of the treatment process  our wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater  which they discharge to potw pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authority 
we are required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs 
we believe each of our operating facilities complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements 

table of contents in december  the epa promulgated new effluent limitations  pretreatment standards and source performance standards for centralized waste treatment cwt facilities 
cwt facilities receive and treat a wide variety of hazardous and non hazardous waste waters from off site companies and discharge the treated water directly to waterways or to municipal sewer systems 
the new rules set stringent limits for the discharge of metals  organic compounds and oil 
all of our wastewater treatment facilities are affected by the new rules and were in compliance with the discharge standards by december tsca 
we also operate a network of collection  treatment and field services remediation activities throughout north america that are regulated under provisions of the tsca 
tsca established a national program for the management of substances classified as pcbs  which include waste pcbs as well as rcra wastes contaminated with pcbs 
the rules set minimum design and operating requirements for storage  treatment and disposal of pcb wastes 
since their initial publication  the rules have been modified to enhance the management standards for tsca regulated operations including the decommissioning of pcb transformers and articles  detoxification of transformer oils  incineration of pcb liquids and solids  landfill disposal of pcb solids  and remediation of pcb contamination at customer sites 
other federal laws 
in addition to regulations specifically directed at the transportation  storage  and disposal facilities  there are a number of regulations that may pass through to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities 
each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste  facility or industry 
examples of this type of regulation are national emission standards for benzene waste operations and national emissions standards for pharmaceuticals production 
each facility will address these regulations on a case by case basis determined by its ability to comply with the pass through regulations 
in our transportation operations  we are regulated by the us department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  and the us coast guard  as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass 
health and safety standards under the osha are applicable to all of our operations 
this includes both the technical services and site services operations 
state and local regulations pursuant to the epa s authorization of their rcra equivalent programs  a number of states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous waste facilities 
accordingly  the hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal activities of a number of our facilities are regulated by the relevant state agencies in addition to federal epa regulation 
some states classify as hazardous some wastes which are not regulated under rcra 
for example  massachusetts considers used oil as hazardous wastes while rcra does not 
accordingly  we must comply with state requirements for handling state regulated wastes  and  when necessary  obtain state licenses for treating  storing  and disposing of such wastes at our facilities 
we believe that each of our facilities is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of rcra  state laws and regulations 
once issued  such licenses have maximum fixed terms of a given number of years  which differ from state to state  ranging from three years to ten years 
the issuing state agency may review or modify a license at any time during its term 
we anticipate that once a license is issued with respect to a facility  the license will be renewed at the end of its term if the facility s operations are in compliance with applicable requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that regulations governing future licensing will remain static  or that we will be able to comply with such requirements 

table of contents our wastewater treatment facilities are also subject to state and local regulation  most significantly sewer discharge regulations adopted by the municipalities  which receive treated wastewater from the treatment processes 
our continued ability to operate our liquid waste treatment process at each such facility is dependent upon our ability to continue these sewer discharges 
our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes  including those addressing clean water and clean air 
local sewer discharge and flammable storage requirements are applicable to certain of our facilities 
our facilities are also subject to local siting  zoning and land use restrictions 
although our facilities occasionally have been cited for regulatory violations  we believe we are in substantial compliance with all federal  state and local laws regulating our business 
canadian hazardous waste regulation in canada  the provinces retain control over environmental issues within their boundaries and thus have the primary responsibility for regulating management of hazardous wastes 
the federal government regulates issues of national scope  or where activities cross provincial boundaries 
provincial regulations 
to a greater or lesser extent  provinces have enacted legislation and developed regulations to fit their needs 
most of canada s industrial development and the major part of its population can be found in four provinces ontario  quebec  alberta and british columbia 
it is in these provinces that the most detailed environmental regulations are found 
we operate major waste management facilities in each of these provinces  as well as waste transfer facilities in nova scotia and manitoba 
the main provincial acts dealing with hazardous waste management are ontario environmental protection act quebec environmental quality act alberta environmental protection and enhancement act british columbia waste management act these pieces of legislation were developed by the provinces totally independently and  among other things  generally control the generation  characterization  transport  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes 
regulations developed by the provinces under the relevant legislation are also developed independently  but are often quite similar in effect and sometimes in application 
for example  there is some uniformity in manifest design and utilization 
provincial legislation also provides for the establishment of waste management facilities 
in this case  the facilities are also controlled by provincial statutes and regulations governing emissions to air  groundwater and surface water and prescribing design criteria and operational guidelines 
waste transporters require a permit to operate under provincial waste management regulations and are subject to the requirements of the federal transportation of dangerous goods legislation 
they are required to report the quantities and disposition of materials shipped 
within the provincial regulations  definitions of hazardous wastes are quite similar 
wastes can be defined as hazardous based on origin or characteristic and the descriptions or parameters involved are very similar to those in effect in the united states 
a major difference between the united states regulatory regime and those in canada relates to ownership and liability 
under canadian provincial regulations  ownership changes when waste is transferred to a properly permitted third party carrier and subsequently to an approved treatment and disposal facility 
this means that the generator is no longer liable for improper handling  treatment or disposal  responsibility having been transferred to the carrier or the facility 
exceptions may occur if the carrier is working under contract to the generator or if the waste is different from that which was originally contracted among the parties 

table of contents canadian federal regulations 
the federal government has authority for those matters  which are national in scope and in impact and for canada s relations with other nations 
the main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are canadian environmental protection act  cepa transportation of dangerous goods act environment canada is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters and the main legislative instrument is the canadian environmental protection act 
this act charges environment canada and health canada with protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production  importation and use of substances in canada and to control their impact on the environment 
the export and import of hazardous wastes regulations under cepa control the export and import of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable materials 
by reference  these regulations incorporate the transportation of dangerous goods act and regulations  which address identification  packaging  marking and documentation of hazardous materials during transport 
cepa requires that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous wastes or hazardous recyclable materials or to transport them through canada notify the minister of the environment and obtain a permit to do so 
section of cepa allows the federal government to enter into administrative agreements with the provinces and territories for the development and improvement of environmental standards 
these agreements represent co operation towards a common goal rather than a delegation of authority under cepa to facilitate the development of provincial and territorial agreements  the federal  provincial and territorial governments participate in the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 
the council comprises the environment ministers from the federal  provincial and territorial governments  who normally meet twice a year to discuss national environmental priorities and to determine work to carried out under the auspices of ccme 
canadian local and municipal regulations 
local and municipal regulations seldom reference direct control of hazardous waste management activities 
municipal regulations and by laws  however  control such issues as land use designation  access to municipal services and use of emergency services  all of which can have a significant impact on facility operation 
compliance with environmental regulations we incur costs and make capital investments in order to comply with the previously discussed environmental regulations 
these regulations require that we remediate environmental liabilities which almost entirely consist of certain environmental liabilities assumed as part of the csd assets acquired  operate the facilities in accordance with enacted regulations  obtain required financial assurance for closure and post closure care of the facilities should the facilities cease operations  make capital investments in order to keep facilities in compliance with environmental regulations and defend ourselves in legal proceedings including environmental proceedings 
as further discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings acquisition and environmental liabilities  we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets environmental liabilities valued in accordance with gaap and a plan to settle obligations that was established at the time of the acquisition and adjusted to reflect additional information gathered under the plan relating to the nature and extent of environmental liabilities assumed through the first anniversary of the acquisition of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we spent million relating to accrued environmental liabilities 
almost all of the spending related to the environmental liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of the csd assets 
for the year ending december   we anticipate spending approximately million relating to our environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully above under the heading insurance and financial assurance  we are required to provide financial assurance with respect to certain statutorily required closure  post closure and corrective action obligations at our facilities 
we have placed most of the required financial assurance for facility closure 
table of contents and post closure monitoring with a qualified insurance company 
in addition to the direct cost of the financial assurance  the policy requires that we provide letters of credit of approximately million as collateral for the financial assurance policy 
the letter of credit facility agreement under which the letters of credit are issued requires us to post cash collateral of of the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
we incur significant costs in posting collateral due to our borrowing funds under our financing arrangements at interest rates ranging from libor at december  plus for borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to libor plus for borrowings under our senior loans  while we earn interest on the cash collateral at money market rates at december  
as described in item  legal proceedings  we are involved in legal proceedings arising under environmental laws and regulations 
alleged failure by us to comply with laws and regulations may lead to the imposition of fines or the denial  revocation or delay of the renewal of permits and licenses by governmental entities 
in addition  such governmental entities  as well as surrounding landowners  may claim that we are liable for environmental damages 
citizens groups have become increasingly active in challenging the grant or renewal of permits and licenses for hazardous waste facilities  and responding to such challenges has further increased the costs associated with establishing new facilities or expanding current facilities 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
item properties our principal executive offices are in braintree  massachusetts where approximately  square feet are leased under arrangements expiring in there are also us based regional administrative offices in massachusetts and south carolina  and regional administrative offices in ontario and quebec 
we own or lease property in states  six canadian provinces  mexico and puerto rico 
our principal property  plant and equipment consist of land  landfill assets and buildings primarily incinerators  wastewater treatment plants and transfer stations  vehicles and equipment including environmental remediation equipment 
we have active permitted hazardous waste management properties  and service centers and satellite or support locations  which occasionally move to other locations as operations and space requirements change 
the incinerators  landfills  and tsdfs are our most significant properties and they are included in the technical services segment 
our properties are sufficient and suitable to our needs 
the following tables set forth certain information as of december  regarding our properties 
substantially all of our properties are pledged as collateral for our loans 
hazardous waste management properties included in the hazardous waste management properties are five incineration locations  nine commercial landfills  seven wastewater treatment plants  tsdfs  and seven facilities which specialize in pcb management 
some properties offer multiple capabilities 
as described below under inactive properties  we also own discontinued facilities 

table of contents hazardous waste facilities incinerators 
we own five operating incineration facilities containing a total of seven incinerators  as follows of incinerators practical capacity tons utilization rate year ended december  nebraska utah texas ontario  canada quebec  canada our incinerators offer a wide range of technological capabilities to customers through this network 
incineration in the united states is provided by a fluidized bed thermal oxidation unit and two solids and liquids capable incineration facilities

landfills 
in the united states and canada  we operate nine commercial landfills as follows of facilities remaining highly probable airspace cubic yards  in thousands remaining lives years california  and colorado north dakota oklahoma texas utah alberta  canada ontario  canada seven of our commercial landfills are designed and permitted for the disposal of hazardous wastes and two landfills are operated for non hazardous industrial waste disposal and  to a lesser extent  municipal solid waste 
in addition to our commercial landfills  we also own and operates two non commercial landfills which only accept waste from on site incinerators 
we own all of the landfills with the exception of the landfill in oklahoma that is leased 
wastewater treatment plants 
we operate seven facilities that offer a range of wastewater treatment technologies and customer services  as follows of facilities owned leased connecticut louisiana tennessee ohio ontario  canada

specially designed containment systems  vehicles and other equipment permitted for hazardous and industrial waste transport  together with drivers trained in transportation skills and waste handling procedures  provide for the movement of customer waste streams 
pcb management facilities and oil storage or recycling capabilities 
we operate seven facilities specializing in pcb management or provide oil storage and recycling capabilities in six states  of which four are owned and three are leased 
these facilities are the most significant properties relating to our site services segment 
other facilities and properties service centers and satellite locations 
we operate service centers and satellite or support locations in states  three provinces in canada  one in mexico and one in puerto rico  of which are owned and are leased 
these locations are aligned with one or more of our landfills  incinerators  wastewater treatment  consulting  administrative  or other treatment and disposal facilities 
inactive csd facilities 
in addition to the active facilities and properties described above  we own a total of discontinued facilities that were acquired as part of the csd assets due to our assumption of the remediation liabilities associated with such properties or our closure of such sites 
see item  business acquisition above 
the principal such discontinued facilities are a closed incinerator and landfill in baton rouge  louisiana  closed incinerators in roebuck  south carolina and bridgeport  new jersey  and two closed wastewater treatment facilities in cleveland  ohio 
prior to the sale of the csd assets  safety kleen gave notice to the applicable regulatory agencies of safety kleen s intent to close the facilities  and safety kleen stopped accepting wastes at baton rouge in  at roebuck in  at bridgeport in and at cleveland in we are proceeding with the closure process 

table of contents item legal proceedings general environmental matters our waste services are continuously regulated by federal  state  provincial and local laws enacted to regulate discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise protect the environment 
this ongoing regulation results in us frequently becoming a party to judicial or administrative proceedings involving all levels of governmental authorities and other interested parties 
the issues involved in such proceedings generally relate to applications for permits and licenses by us and conformity with legal requirements and alleged violations of existing permits and licenses 
at december   we were involved in various proceedings the principal of which are described below  in which a governmental authority is a party relating primarily to activities at or shipments from our waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
legal proceedings assumed in connection with acquisition of csd assets effective september  the closing date  we purchased from safety kleen services  inc and certain of its domestic subsidiaries collectively  the sellers substantially all of the assets of the chemical services division the csd of safety kleen corp 
safety kleen except for safety kleen s pinewood facility near the town of pinewood in sumter county  south carolina 
we purchased the csd assets pursuant to a sale order the sale order issued by the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware which has jurisdiction over the chapter proceedings involving the sellers  and we therefore took title to the csd assets without assumption of any liability including pending or threatened litigation of the sellers except as expressly provided in the sale order 
however  under the sale order which incorporated by reference certain provisions of the acquisition agreement between us and safety kleen services  inc  we became subject to certain legal proceedings involving the csd assets for three reasons as described below 
as of december   we had reserves of million substantially all of which we have established as part of the purchase price for the csd assets relating to our estimated potential liabilities in connection with such legal proceedings 
we periodically adjust the aggregate amount of such reserves when such potential liabilities are paid or otherwise discharged or additional relevant information becomes available to us 
during the one year period which commenced on the effective date of the acquisition of the csd assets  we obtained information necessary to evaluate our assumed liabilities  and based thereon  estimated the fair values of the assumed liabilities 
such adjustments were recorded as part of the purchase price allocation 
now that such one year period has expired  we will no longer make such additional adjustments to the purchase price 
future adjustments that result from pre acquisition contingencies will be included in the determination of net income in the period in which the adjustments are determined 
the first reason for our assumption of certain legal proceedings in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets is that  as part of the csd assets  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of certain canadian subsidiaries the csd canadian subsidiaries formerly owned by the sellers which subsidiaries were not part of the sellers bankruptcy proceedings  and we therefore became subject to the legal proceedings which include the ville mercier legal proceedings described below in which the canadian subsidiaries are now or may in the future become involved 
the second reason is that there are ongoing legal proceedings which include the fusrap legal proceedings described below which  while we will not be responsible for damages or other liabilities of the sellers relating to such proceedings  may nevertheless affect the future operation of certain of the csd assets 
the third reason is that  as part of the purchase price for the csd assets  we agreed with the sellers that we will assume and pay certain current and future liabilities of the sellers under applicable federal and state environmental laws including  in particular  the sellers share of certain cleanup costs payable to governmental entities under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund act or analogous state superfund laws 

table of contents the principal legal proceedings which we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets are as follows ville mercier legal proceedings 
one of the csd canadian subsidiaries the mercier subsidiary owns and operates a hazardous waste incinerator in ville mercier  quebec the mercier facility 
a portion of the mercier facility is now contaminated as a result of actions dating back to  when the quebec government issued to the unrelated company which then owned the mercier facility two permits to dump organic liquids into lagoons on the property 
by  groundwater contamination had been identified  and the quebec government provided an alternate water supply to the municipality of ville mercier 
in  ville mercier and three neighboring municipalities filed separate legal proceedings against the mercier subsidiary and certain related companies together with certain former officers and directors  as well as against the government of quebec 
the lawsuits assert that the defendants are jointly and severally responsible for the contamination of groundwater in the region  which the plaintiffs claim was caused by contamination from the former ville mercier lagoons and which they claim caused each municipality to incur additional costs to supply drinking water for their citizens since the s and early s 
the four municipalities claim a total of million cdn as damages for additional costs to obtain drinking water supplies and seek an injunctive order to obligate the defendants to remediate the groundwater in the region 
the mercier subsidiary continues to assert that it has no responsibility for the groundwater contamination in the region 
because the continuation of such proceedings by the mercier subsidiary  which we now own  will require us to incur legal and other costs and the risks inherent in any such litigation  we  as part of our integration plan for the csd assets  decided to vigorously review potential likely options which would allow us to establish harmonious relations with the local communities  resolve the adversarial situation with the provincial government and spare continued legal costs 
based upon our review of likely settlement possibilities  we now anticipate that as part of any such settlement we will likely agree to assume at least partial responsibility for remediation of certain environmental contamination and we have been able to estimate the likely cost of such remediation 
accordingly  we recorded in the third quarter of based upon a plan to settle obligations that was established at the time of the acquisition  as an adjustment to the purchase price of the csd assets  a net increase in recorded liabilities primarily for remedial liabilities and associated legal costs relating to the ville mercier legal proceedings 
at december   we had accrued million relating to the ville mercier legal proceedings 
fusrap legal proceedings 
as part of the csd assets  we acquired a hazardous waste landfill in buttonwillow  california the buttonwillow landfill 
during and  the seller s subsidiary which then owned the buttonwillow landfill the buttonwillow seller accepted and disposed in the buttonwillow landfill certain construction debris the fusrap wastes that originated at a site in new york that was part of the federal formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap 
fusrap was created in the mid s in an attempt to manage various sites around the country contaminated with residual radioactivity from activities conducted by the atomic energy commission and the united states military during world war ii 
the fusrap wastes are primarily construction and demolition debris exhibiting low activity residual radioactivity that were shipped to the buttonwillow landfill by us army corps of engineers 
the california department of health services dhs has claimed in a letter to the buttonwillow seller that the buttonwillow seller did not lawfully accept the fusrap wastes under applicable california law and regulations 
both dhs and the california department of toxic substances control dtsc filed claims in the sellers bankruptcy proceedings preserving the right of those agencies to claim penalties for damages against the buttonwillow seller and possibly seeking to compel removal of the fusrap wastes from the buttonwillow landfill 
the specified agencies are still investigating whether they believe the buttonwillow seller violated any california law or regulation and  aside from the letter to the buttonwillow seller and the filing of the proofs of claim in the sellers bankruptcy proceedings  the california agencies have not commenced any enforcement proceedings relating to the buttonwillow landfill 
however  in november  a california non profit 
table of contents corporation allegedly acting under the california unfair business practices act added us as the current owner of the buttonwillow landfill as a defendant to a lawsuit which that corporation had originally brought in against certain of the sellers in the california superior court for the county of los angeles 
that lawsuit seeks  among other matters  an order requiring the named defendants which now include us to remove the fusrap wastes from the buttonwillow landfill and to dispose of this material at a facility licensed for disposal of radioactive waste 
under the sale order  we are not liable for penalties  if any  which the buttonwillow seller might ultimately be determined to owe to the dhs and dtsc  but we could potentially be liable for removal costs if such agencies or the non profit corporation described above were ultimately to obtain a final non appealable order determining that the fusrap wastes were improperly disposed of at the buttonwillow landfill and directing that such wastes be removed 
we now estimate the cost of removing the fusrap wastes from the buttonwillow landfill would be approximately million 
however  both the sellers and we believe that the fusrap wastes were properly  safely and lawfully disposed of at the buttonwillow landfill under all applicable laws and regulations and they will vigorously resist any efforts to require that such wastes be removed 
in addition  we believe that the california state court in the suit brought by the non profit corporation under the california unfair business practices act described above which is currently the only pending legal proceeding relating to the fusrap wastes to which we are a party could not properly grant any order requiring us to remove the fusrap wastes 
we have not accrued any costs of removing the fusrap wastes because we believe that only a remote possibility exists that a final order will be issued requiring us to remove such wastes 
tanner act proceeding 
in the conditional use permit cup issued by kern county  california for the seller s buttonwillow landfill was challenged by a local interest group  padres hacia una lina vida mejor and its individual members 
the proceeding was initiated under the tanner act  a unique california statute that enables citizens to appeal local land use decisions regarding hazardous waste facilities under california health and safety code section 
under the tanner act  the governor or a designee  upon making certain findings  must appoint a member appeal board that is empowered to convene hearings and if necessary require the local agency to modify its land use decision in accordance with the appeal board decision 
the appeal process involves two phases  a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to a hearing and  if so  a hearing to determine whether the conditions imposed by the local agency are inadequate 
in the buttonwillow proceeding  the preliminary hearings were held intermittently from november through may the appeal board issued its preliminary hearing decision on july  the appeal board rejected nine of the ten issues submitted to it by the petitioners 
the appeal board decided that one issue should proceed to a full hearing  namely issue y  which challenges a permit condition that establishes certain limits on the disposal of radioactive waste at the facility 
in the full hearing to be held on issue y  the appeal board must determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the provision in the cup governing the receipt of radioactive waste fails to protect the public health  safety or welfare 
the hearing phase of the proceeding has not yet been scheduled 
we have convened a panel of experts to review the technical issues and are prepared to vigorously present our case to the appeal board 
the parties are also currently engaged in settlement negotiations 
although we have established reserves to cover our estimated legal costs to be incurred in connection with this legal proceeding  the outcome of the proceeding cannot be predicted nor can a range of probable loss be estimated  accordingly  we have not recorded any other liability relating to this proceeding 
assumption of certain csd superfund liabilities 
our agreement to pay as part of the purchase price for the csd assets the sellers share of certain cleanup costs payable to governmental entities under federal and state superfund laws relate primarily to i certain potential liabilities which the sellers might incur in the future in connection with an incinerator formerly operated by marine shale processors to which the sellers shipped hazardous wastes  ii two properties included in the csd assets which are now subject to superfund proceedings and for which one or more of the sellers has been designated a potentially responsible party prp  iii active superfund sites owned by third parties where the sellers have been designated as prps  and iv several inactive superfund sites owned by third parties where the sellers have been named as prps but as to which the sellers and we believe the sellers have no significant liabilities 

table of contents federal and state superfund laws generally impose joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up superfund sites not only upon the owners and operators of such sites  but also upon persons or entities which in the past have either generated or shipped hazardous wastes which are present on such sites 
accordingly  the superfund laws encourage prps to agree to share in specified percentages of the aggregate cleanup costs for superfund sites by entering into consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements 
non settling prps may be liable for any shortfalls in government cost recovery and may be liable to other prps for equitable contribution 
under the superfund laws  a settling prp s financial liability could increase if the other settling prps were to become insolvent or if additional or more severe contamination were discovered at the relevant site 
in estimating the amount of those sellers liabilities which we have agreed to assume for cleanup costs at superfund sites where one or more of the sellers has been designated as a prp  we therefore reviewed any existing consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements with respect to those sites  the sellers negotiated volumetric share of liability where applicable  our prior knowledge of the relevant sites  and our general experience in dealing with the cleanup of superfund sites 
marine shale processors 
beginning in the mid s and continuing until july  marine shale processors  inc  located in amelia  louisiana marine shale  operated a kiln which incinerated waste producing a vitrified aggregate as a by product 
marine shale contended that its operation recycled waste into a useful product  ie  vitrified aggregate  and therefore was exempt from regulation under the resource conservation recovery act rcra and permitting requirements as a hazardous waste incinerator under applicable federal and state environmental laws 
the epa contended that marine shale was a sham recycler subject to the regulation and permitting requirements as a hazardous waste incinerator under rcra  that its vitrified aggregate by product was a hazardous waste  and that marine shale s continued operation without required permits was illegal 
litigation between the epa and marine shale began in and continued until july when the us fifth circuit court of appeals ordered marine shale to shut down its operations 
during the course of its operation  marine shale produced thousands of tons of aggregate  some of which was sold as fill material at various locations in the vicinity of amelia  louisiana  but most of which was stockpiled on the premises of the marine shale facility 
almost all of this aggregate has since been moved to a nearby site owned by an affiliate of marine shale  known as recycling park  inc in accordance with a court order authorizing the movement of this material to this off site location  all of the materials located at recycling park  inc comply with the land disposal restrictions of rcra 
approximately  tons of aggregate remain on the marine shale site 
moreover  as a result of past operations  soil and groundwater contamination may exist on the marine shale facility and the recycling park  inc site 
although the sellers never held an equity interest in marine shale  the sellers were among the largest customers of marine shale in terms of overall incineration revenue 
if the epa or the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq were to designate the marine shale facility and or the recycling park  inc site as a superfund site or sites  the sellers could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs as prps and  in such event  we could be obligated to pay all or a portion of such costs in accordance with our agreement described above to assume certain of the sellers superfund liabilities to governmental entities as part of the purchase price for the csd assets 
based on a plan to settle obligations that was established at the time of the acquisition  we obtained more complete information as to the potential status of the marine shale facility and the recycling park  inc site as a superfund site or sites  the potential costs associated with possible removal and disposal of some or all of the vitrified aggregate and closure and remediation of the marine shale facility and the recycling park  inc site  and the respective shares of other identified potential prps on a volumetric basis 
accordingly  we have determined that the remedial liabilities and associated legal costs are now probable and estimable  and we recorded in the third quarter of  as adjustments to the purchase price of the csd assets  liabilities for our estimate of the sellers proportionate share of environmental cleanup costs potentially payable to governmental entities under federal and or state superfund laws at the marine shale facility and recycling park  inc site 
at december   we had accrued million relating to the marine shale facility and the recycling park  inc site 

table of contents properties included in csd assets 
the two properties included in the csd assets which are now subject to superfund proceedings and for which one or more the sellers has been designated as a prp are located at north new york street in wichita  kansas the north new york street property  and at burton road in lexington  south carolina the burton road property 
the north new york street property is an active service center which is one of several properties located within the boundaries of a  acre state designated superfund site in an old industrial section of wichita known as the north industrial corridor site 
the sellers have executed a consent decree relating to such site with the epa  and we will continue the ongoing remediation program for the north new york street property 
included within the csd assets acquired by us are rights under an indemnification agreement between the sellers and a prior owner of the north new york street property which we anticipate will be available to reimburse certain cleanup costs 
the burton road property is now vacant but was formerly operated by the sellers as a waste transfer and truck cleaning facility  and the property is located within the boundaries of a state designated superfund site known as the hollis road site 
in june  the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec initiated a lawsuit against the sellers and two other parties that owned or operated facilities within the hollis road site boundaries 
on february  we and two subsidiaries of the seller entered into a consent decree with the dhec  which has been approved by the united states district court  settling the south carolina claims and lawsuit with respect to the hollis road superfund site and the burton road property 
the consent decree provides that we must make two installment payments to dhec 
the consent decree contains a customary covenant not to sue and contribution protection provisions for us  and also contains a limited re opener provision 
the re opener provision would require us to perform soils remediation work within the boundaries of our burton road property if new releases or spills were to occur or if there was independently verifiable data to substantiate that a specified contaminant or its degradation products were discovered above certain concentration levels in the soils at the burton road property 
at this time we are aware of no data which identifies such contamination at the burton road property 
at december   we had total reserves of million relating to our liabilities for the north new york street property and the burton road property 
active third party superfund sites 
prior to the closing date  the sellers had generated or shipped hazardous wastes which are present on an aggregate of sites owned by third parties which have subsequently been designated as federal or state superfund sites and at which the sellers  along with other parties  have been designated as prps 
at of those sites  the sellers have addressed their cleanup obligations to the federal and state governments and to other prps by entering into consent decrees or other settlement agreements or by participating in ongoing settlement discussions or site studies and  in accordance therewith  the prp group is generally performing or has agreed to perform the site remediation program with government oversight 
of the five remaining active sites at which one or more of the sellers has been designated as a prp  we on behalf of the sellers are contesting liability at two sites and plans to fund participation by the sellers as settling prps at three sites 
for the sites  we had reserves of million at december  in addition  we estimate that the discounted reasonably possible additional liabilities for the sites total approximately million 
inactive third party superfund sites 
in addition to the active superfund sites owned by third parties  the sellers have also been identified as prps at several other federal or state superfund sites owned by third parties which we believe are now inactive with respect to the sellers 
the inactive sites generally involve the shipment by the sellers of a de minimis amount of wastes to such sites and prior consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements providing for minimal payment obligations by the sellers 
de minimis agreements generally are intended to settle all claims for small prps and such agreements have limited re opener provisions 
at certain other inactive sites  the sellers have disclaimed any liability by advising the governmental entities involved that the sellers had not shipped any wastes to those sites 
except to the extent that minimal amounts remain to be paid under existing consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements  we have not established reserves for any of the inactive sites because we believe that the sellers cleanup liabilities with respect to those sites have already been resolved 

table of contents other legal proceedings related to csd assets in addition to the legal proceedings which we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets  one lawsuit has been filed against us subsequent to the acquisition based in part upon allegations relating to our current operations of a former csd facility 
in december  a lawsuit was filed in the th judicial district court in iberville parish  louisiana  against our subsidiary which acquired and now operates a deep injection well facility near plaquemine  louisiana 
this lawsuit was brought under the citizen suit provisions of the louisiana environmental quality act 
the lawsuit alleges that the facility is in violation of state law by disposing of hazardous waste into an underground injection well that the plaintiffs allege is located within the banks or boundaries of a body of surface water within the jurisdiction of the state of louisiana 
the lawsuit also focuses on a new area of concern which the plaintiffs allege is a source of contamination which will require environmental remediation and or restoration 
the lawsuit also alleges that our former facility manager made false representations and failed to disclose material information to the regulators about the site after we acquired it in september the plaintiffs seek an order declaring the injection well to be located within the banks or boundaries of a body of surface water under state law  to prevent further alleged violations of state law  payment of civil penalties  and an additional penalty of million for damages to the environment  plus interest 
the plaintiffs also seek an order requiring the facility to remove all waste disposed of since september of  and in general  to conduct an investigation into and remediate the alleged contamination at the facility  as well as damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage  natural resources damages  costs of litigation  and attorney s fees 
we believe this lawsuit is without merit  and intend to fully and vigorously defend against the claims made 
we further believe that  since its acquisition by us  the plaquemine facility has been and now is in full compliance with its operating permits and all applicable state laws  and that any alleged contamination in the area complained of by the plaintiffs was and is already being addressed under the corrective action provisions of its rcra operating permit 
in addition  we believe that many of the plaintiffs claims relate to actions or omissions allegedly taken or caused by third parties that formerly owned and or operated  or generated or shipped waste to  the plaquemine facility for which we have no legal responsibility under the sale order 
although we have established reserves to cover our estimated legal costs to be incurred in connection with this proceeding  this litigation is in its very preliminary stages and we are therefore unable to estimate any other potential liability relating to the lawsuit 
legal proceedings not related to csd assets in addition to the legal proceedings in which we became involved as a result of our acquisition of the csd assets  we are also involved in certain legal proceedings which have arisen for other reasons 
the principal such legal proceedings include certain federal securities class action litigation  certain superfund proceedings relating to sites owned by third parties where we or a predecessor have been named a prp  two epa regulatory proceedings  and litigation involving the former holders of our subordinated notes 
federal securities class action litigation 
on november   an individual plaintiff who purchased  shares of our common stock filed a purported class action suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us and a current and former officer of clean harbors 
the plaintiff alleges violation of the securities exchange act of and regulations promulgated thereunder by the securities and exchange commission the sec  and seeks certification of a class that would consist of all purchasers of our stock between november  and august  principally  the complaint alleges that in connection with certain public announcements the defendants failed to disclose adverse information with respect to the impact of the acquisition of the csd assets on us and that certain financial projections  particularly the guidance issued with respect to anticipated ebitda for  were overstated and made without reasonable basis 
subsequently  three additional plaintiffs who purchased   and  shares of our common stock  respectively  filed complaints in the same court containing essentially the same allegations and seeking the same class certification 
in january  several plaintiffs within the putative class filed  through their attorneys  
table of contents competing motions seeking to be named lead plaintiff  seeking the right to select lead counsel and seeking consolidation of the four suits 
we anticipate that these actions will be consolidated during the first quarter of  after which we will file our formal legal response to the consolidated suit 
we believe that at all times during the purported class period we and the two other defendants conducted themselves in compliance with relevant securities laws and that the guidance as to anticipated ebitda and other forward looking statements contained in our public announcements are protected by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we intend to vigorously contest the plaintiffs allegations 
however  this litigation is in its very preliminary stages  and we are therefore unable to give an assessment of any potential impact on the company 
superfund sites not related to csd acquisition 
we have been named as a prp at sites that are not related to the csd acquisition 
fourteen of these sites involve two subsidiaries  which we acquired from chemwaste  a former subsidiary of waste management  inc as part of that acquisition  chemwaste agreed to indemnify us with respect to any liability of its braintree and natick subsidiaries for waste disposed of before we acquired them 
accordingly  waste management is paying all costs of defending our braintree and natick subsidiaries in these cases  including legal fees and settlement costs 
our subsidiary which owns the bristol  connecticut facility is involved in one of the superfund sites 
as part of the acquisition of the bristol  connecticut and cincinnati  ohio facilities  the seller and its now parent company  cemex  sa  agreed to indemnify us with respect to any liability for waste disposed of before we acquired the facilities  which would include any liability arising from superfund sites 
six of the sites involve former subsidiaries of chemclear inc some of these sites have been settled  and we believe our ultimate exposure with respect to the remaining such sites will not be material to our results of operations  cash flow from operations or financial position 
in july  we acquired a transportation company which is involved in four of the sites  as a transporter of waste generated by others prior to our purchase of that transportation company 
we acquired that transportation company in exchange for  shares of our common stock  of which  shares were deposited into an escrow account to be held as security for the sellers agreement to indemnify us against potential undisclosed liabilities  including environmental liabilities arising from prior ownership and operation of that transportation company 
we anticipate those escrow shares will be released during since no additional environmental claims have been asserted against us 
one of the sites relates to murphy s waste oil services  inc  which we acquired in we were identified as a prp at two other of the sites  but we believe that we have no liability at those sites 
as of december  and  we had reserves of million for cleanup of superfund sites not related to the csd acquisition at which either we or a predecessor has been named as a prp 
epa enforcement actions kimball facility 
on april   region vii of the us environmental protection agency epa region vii in kansas city  kansas  served a complaint  compliance order and notice of opportunity for hearing cco on our subsidiary which operates an incineration facility in kimball  nebraska 
the cco stems from an inspection of the kimball facility between april  thereafter  epa region vii issued a notice of violation nov for certain alleged violations of rcra 
we responded to the nov by letter and contested the allegations 
the epa alleges  among other things  that the facility had open containers of incinerator ash in the ash stabilization building  stored incompatible wastes without adequate separation  and failed to label equipment in hazardous waste service 
after extensive settlement negotiations  on february   we and epa region vii executed a consent agreement and final order that included a supplemental 
table of contents environmental project sep 
we will be required to perform and account for the sep in accordance with the epa s sep policy 
the sep will involve cleaning out chemicals from high school laboratories  art department and other campus locations  with all such work to be performed by our trained field chemists 
the sep will also include the proper packaging  labeling  manifesting  transportation  and ultimately disposal  recycling or re use of these chemicals at the hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities owned and operated by our subsidiaries  in lieu of the payment of any further civil penalties 
we will have two years to complete the performance of the sep  and any remaining amounts then still owed and outstanding will have to be paid in cash at that time  as calculated pursuant to a sliding scale formula that reduces the amount of cash that will be owed as more of the environmental services are rendered over the two year period 
at december   we had accrued thousand for our sep liability 
chicago facility 
by letter dated january   region v of the epa epa region v in chicago  illinois notified us that epa region v believes our chicago  illinois facility may be in violation of the national emission standard for benzene waste operations subpart ff regulations promulgated under the clean air act and that epa region v may seek injunctive relief and civil penalties for these alleged violations 
the alleged violations pertain to total annual benzene quantity determinations and reporting  provisions of individual waste stream identification and emissions control information  and treatment and control requirements for the benzene waste streams 
we believe that our chicago facility complies in all material respects with these regulations and has engaged in settlement discussions with epa region v to resolve the issues described in the letter from epa region v without litigation 
the results of those discussions cannot be determined at this time 
litigation involving former holders of subordinated notes 
on april   we issued to john hancock life insurance company  special value bond fund  llc  the bill and melinda gates foundation  and certain other institutional lenders collectively  the lenders million of senior subordinated notes due the subordinated notes as part of our refinancing of all our then outstanding indebtedness 
under the securities purchase agreement dated as of april   between us and the lenders the purchase agreement  we were also required to pay a thousand closing fee and issue to the lenders warrants for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock the warrants exercisable at any time prior to april  at an exercise price of 
per share 
the purchase agreement contained covenants limiting with certain exceptions our ability to acquire other businesses or incur additional indebtedness without the consent of a majority in interest of the lenders 
the purchase agreement also provided that  if we should elect to prepay the subordinated notes prior to maturity  we would be obligated to pay a prepayment penalty which  in the case of a prepayment prior to april   would include a so called make whole amount computed using a discount rate above the then current yield on united states government securities of equal maturity to the subordinated notes 
the purchase agreement also provided that  if we should default on any of the terms of the purchase agreement including the covenants described above  the lenders would have the right to call the subordinated notes for payment at an amount equal to the principal  accrued interest and the so called make whole amount then in effect 
during several months prior to our acquisition of the csd assets effective september   we sought the lenders cooperation with respect to such acquisition and to include the lenders in a refinancing of our outstanding debt which might involve leaving the subordinated notes outstanding or refinancing them 
the lenders  however  ultimately refused to provide any such cooperation 
we thus notified the lenders that it was proceeding with the acquisition of the csd assets  which would be a violation of certain covenants in the purchase agreement  and the lenders then called the subordinated notes for payment  including principal  interest and the make whole amount of million  an amount equal to of the principal amount of the subordinated notes 
in response to the lenders demand  we immediately paid in full the amount demanded  while notifying the lenders that we were paying the make whole amount under protest 
our position is that if the payment to the lenders is not deemed to be voluntary and the make whole amount is deemed unconscionable  the make whole amount is likely to be held unenforceable under massachusetts case law 

table of contents shortly after the closing of the acquisition of the csd assets  we wrote to the lenders demanding a return of the prepayment penalty  in response to which  on september   the lenders filed a complaint in the norfolk superior court asking the court to determine the prepayment penalty to be valid and enforceable 
on october   we filed a complaint in the business litigation session of the suffolk superior court seeking a declaratory judgment that the make whole amount is an unenforceable penalty and seeking an order for the return of the amount paid as a penalty  less the lenders actual damages if any  plus interest and costs 
in the case of certain of the lenders  we also seek a judgment that those lenders receipt of their share of the make whole amount  the closing payment and the fair value of the warrants constitutes a violation of applicable massachusetts usury laws 
we filed a motion seeking to consolidate both legal proceedings in the business litigation session of the suffolk superior court  which motion was granted 
discovery in the proceedings has been completed and all parties have served and filed motions for summary judgment 
a hearing on the parties respective motions for summary judgment was held on january  at present  those motions are still under advisement with the court
