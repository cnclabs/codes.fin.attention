item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the company s financing issues 
price competition in the staffing industry continues to be intense and pricing pressures from both competitors and customers may result in reduced sales and margins to the company 
the temporary staffing industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry and continues to undergo consolidation 
the company expects the level of competition to remain high in the future  and increasing competitive pricing pressures will continue to make it difficult for the company to raise its prices even though its costs have increased  and may have an adverse effect on the company s market share and operating margins 
the company competes in national  regional and local markets with full service agencies and with specialized temporary services agencies 
many competitors are smaller than the company but may enjoy an advantage over the company in discrete geographic markets because of their stronger local presence 
other competitors have greater marketing  financial and other resources than the company  that among other things could enable them to attempt to maintain or increase their market share by reducing prices 
furthermore  there has been an increase in the number of customers consolidating their staffing services purchases with a single provider or with a small number of providers 
the trend to consolidate staffing services purchases has in some cases made it more difficult for westaff to obtain or retain business 
any significant recurrent economic downturn could result in the company s customers using fewer temporary employees  which could materially adversely affect the company 
demand for the company s staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and unemployment in the united states and the countries in which the company operates 
frequently  customers use temporary staffing services to manage personnel costs and staffing needs 
when economic activity increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
however  as economic activity slows  many customers reduce their utilization of temporary employees before releasing regular full time employees 
typically  the company may experience less demand for its services and more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn 
the recent domestic economic recession and continuing economic uncertainty has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a recurrent recession or a significant lag in economic recovery would likely have a further material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the cost of unemployment insurance premiums and workers compensation costs for westaff s temporary employees may continue to rise and reduce westaff s margins and create liquidity problems 
westaff is responsible for and pays unemployment insurance premiums and workers compensation costs for its temporary employees 
recently  these costs have risen as a result of increased claims  general economic conditions and governmental regulation 
there can be no assurance that westaff will be able to increase the fees charged to its customers in the future to keep pace with increased costs 
as noted previously  price competition in the staffing industry is intense 
there can be no assurance that westaff will be able to maintain or improve its margins  and if it does not  its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 
westaff retains a portion of the risk under its workers compensation program see business risk management programs 
the estimated remaining deductible liability for all existing and incurred but not reported claims is accrued based upon actuarial methods using current claims information  as well as prior experience  and may be subsequently revised each quarter based on new developments related to such claims 
changes in the estimates underlying the claims reserve are charged or credited to earnings in the period determined  and therefore large fluctuations in any given quarter could materially adversely affect earnings in that period 
the company is contractually required to collateralize its recorded obligations under these workers compensation insurance contracts through irrevocable letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
as of november   the company s aggregate collateral requirements have been satisfied through million of letters of credit and million of surety bonds 
for the fiscal workers compensation policy year  westaff changed its funding program such that westaff funded the policy year through monthly cash installments totaling million 
a similar program is in place for fiscal whereby westaff will make monthly cash installments totaling million 
accordingly  during fiscal and  westaff will not only fund the full and policy years  but will also make ongoing cash payments associated with claims paid for all prior policy years 
this has and will continue to increase the company s cash flow requirements 
the policy agreement allows for a reduction in the surety bond collateral of million as of the end of january  and a reduction to the letters of credit of million as of february  however  as the bond is not collateralized with any assets of the company  the bond reduction will not impact the company s borrowing availability 
as noted above  the company currently faces significant pressure on its liquidity 
in the event that cash flow and borrowing capacity under the existing credit facilities  and any potential amendments to such facilities  are insufficient to meet these cash and collateral obligations  the company will be required to seek additional sources of funding to satisfy its liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as noted above  the company is aggressively seeking additional financing to increase its available capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in raising such funds 
westaff s information technology systems are critical to its daily operations 
the company s domestic information management systems  located at a co location facility and corporate headquarters  are critical to daily operations of the company s business 
while backup and recovery systems are in place  should any of these key systems fail  it could severely impact the company s business and operations  specifically its ability to timely and accurately pay employees and bill customers 
the company s domestic back office payroll and billing systems are at the end of their life cycle and are no longer supported by the companies who originally supplied them 
westaff currently utilizes internal support to maintain and update these systems 
this includes the process of applying updates to remain in compliance with tax mandates and other additional regulatory requirements 
this potentially creates exposure should an update not occur in a timely fashion  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
furthermore  the company will likely be required to migrate to newer technology platforms in fiscal which will require investments in new hardware and software which may further strain the company s capital resources 
westaff s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel 
westaff depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified temporary personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of its customers 
westaff must continually evaluate and upgrade its base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
furthermore  a substantial number of the company s temporary employees during any given year will terminate their employment with the company and accept regular staff employment with customers of the company 
competition for individuals with proven skills remains intense  and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available to westaff in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to the company 
the failure to recruit  train and retain qualified temporary employees could materially adversely affect the company s business 
westaff may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect its business 
westaff is in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses 
attendant risks of these activities include possible claims by customers of employee misconduct or negligence  claims by employees of discrimination or harassment including claims relating to actions of westaff s customers  fines and costs related to the inadvertent employment of illegal aliens  payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims  violations of wage and hour requirements  errors and omissions of temporary employees  and claims by customers relating to employees misuse of customer propriety information  misappropriation of funds  other criminal activity or torts or similar claims 
in addition  some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation  which could be time consuming to the company s management team as well as costly and therefore could have a negative effect on its business 
in some instances  westaff has agreed to indemnify its customers against some or all of these types of liabilities 
westaff has policies and guidelines in place to help reduce its exposure to these risks and has purchased insurance policies against certain risks in amounts that it believes to be adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that westaff s insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover these types of risks in the future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that westaff will not experience these problems in the future or that westaff will not incur fines or other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems that could have a material adverse effect on westaff s business 
westaff s founder and chairman controls more than of the company s outstanding stock thus allowing him to exert significant influence on the company s management and affairs 
the company s chairman and founder  w 
robert stover  beneficially owns directly or indirectly  or has voting power over  more than of the company s outstanding stock 
as the principal stockholder of the company  mr 
stover has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval and to exert significant influence on the company s management and affairs 
for example  mr 
stover has the ability to control the election of the board of directors and the appointment of executive management 
he also has the ability to control any merger  consolidation  sale of substantially all of the assets or other strategic decisions affecting the company or the market value of the stock 
this concentration of voting power may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company or other strategic action or result in strategic decisions that could negatively impact the value and liquidity of the outstanding stock 
the market for westaff s stock may be limited and the stock price may continue to be extremely volatile 
the average daily trading volume for westaff s common stock on the nasdaq national market was approximately  shares from january  through december   and there have been numerous days with virtually no trading in the stock 
accordingly  the market price of westaff s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations that have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated because an active trading market has not developed for the stock 
the company believes that the common stock price has also been negatively affected by the fact that the company s stock is thinly traded and the absence of analyst coverage 
the lack of analyst reports about the company s stock may make it difficult for potential investors to make decisions about whether to purchase the company s stock and may make it less likely that investors will purchase the stock  thus further depressing the stock price 
these negative factors may make it difficult for stockholders to sell the company s common stock  which may result in losses for investors 
westaff s business may suffer if it loses its key personnel 
westaff s operations are dependent on the continued efforts of its executive officers and senior management 
additionally  westaff is dependent on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel 
westaff s ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of those key executive officers and senior management who have acquired experience in operating a staffing service company may cause a significant disruption to westaff s business 
moreover  the loss of westaff s key local managers and field personnel may jeopardize existing customer relationships with businesses that continue to use westaff s staffing services based upon past direct relationships with these local managers and field personnel 
either of these types of losses could adversely affect westaff s operations  including westaff s ability to establish and maintain customer relationships 
westaff derives a significant portion of its revenues from affiliate franchise agent and licensed operations 
affiliate operations comprise a significant portion of the company s revenues 
for fiscal  of the company s total revenues were derived from affiliate operations 
in addition  the company s ten largest franchise agents for fiscal based on sales volume accounted for of the company s revenues 
the loss of one or more of the company s franchise agents and any associated loss of customers and sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
westaff is subject to business risks associated with international operations 
the company presently has operations in the united kingdom  australia  new zealand  norway and denmark  which comprised of the company s revenues during fiscal operations in foreign markets are inherently subject to certain risks  including  in particular  different cultures and business practices  overlapping or differing tax structures  economic and political uncertainties  compliance issues associated with accounting and reporting requirements and changing  complex or ambiguous foreign laws and regulations  particularly as they relate to employment 
all of the company s sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies and  accordingly  the company is subject to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates which could cause a reduction in the company s profits 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
westaff is a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions from time to time  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
westaff is regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of its business 
the company does not have insurance for some of these claims and there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage it has will cover all claims that may be asserted against the company 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements not be covered by insurance or exceed its insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain appropriate and sufficient types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the cost of mandated health insurance cost may not be able to be passed onto customers 
on october   the state of california passed the california health insurance act of sb that requires california employers with more than employees to either provide health coverage for their employees and their dependents  or to pay into a state fund for the provision of health coverage by january  the law requires employers to cover a minimum of of the cost of insurance 
the company s temporary payroll for its california employees currently represents approximately of total domestic payroll 
these employees are typically not covered under employer paid health policies 
the company currently pays approximately to of the cost of regular employee insurance depending on the type of coverage 
as a result of the changing business and governmental environment in california  some believe that this law may be repealed prior to the required implementation date 
in the event that this law is not repealed  these costs may be substantial and  with regard to temporary employees  there can be no assurance made that the company will be able to pass them on to customers and maintain its current margins 
in addition  there can be no assurance made that other states will not enact similar health insurance legislation that could have a material impact on the company 
however  since the adoption of employee retirement income security act erisa several states have attempted to pass mandatory health coverage bills that failed legal challenges under erisa 
currently  hawaii  which adopted mandatory health coverage before the passage of erisa and received a grandfather clause exempting the state from the regulation  is the only other state with mandated employer provided health care 
item properties 
the company previously owned one building located in walnut creek  california  consisting of approximately  square feet  where the executive offices were once located 
on february  the company completed the sale of this building for estimated cash proceeds of million 
the company moved its executive offices at the end of january  to its present location at north wiget lane  walnut creek  california 
this building is one of the three adjacent buildings located in walnut creek  california  which house its administrative offices 
these buildings were sold by the company in december the company has leased back all three of these buildings  consisting of approximately  square feet  for a term of seven years commencing on december   with an additional five year option to renew 
in addition  the company leases space for its company owned offices in the united states and abroad 
the majority of the leases are for fixed terms of one to five years and contain customary terms and conditions 
the company believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs and does not anticipate any difficulty replacing such facilities or locating additional facilities  if needed 
item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits 
the principal risks that the company insures against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
on march   synergy staffing  inc claimant filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles  central district 
the defendants named in the case were westaff  inc and several corporate officers 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that the defendants fraudulently induced the plaintiff to sell the assets of the personnel connection  inc the company s petition for an order compelling arbitration was granted and the superior court lawsuit was stayed 
the arbitration proceeded under the auspices of the american arbitration association 
the company s earlier motion for partial summary judgment was granted at the outset of the arbitration hearing  resulting in the dismissal of all the individual defendants except paul norberg 
the majority of the arbitrators on the panel rendered an interim award on january   in favor of the claimant and against the company and mr 
norberg in the principal amount of  plus interest 
the company moved to modify the principal amount of the award 
the panel granted the company s motion and issued an order modifying interim award on february   crediting the respondents for  previously paid under a price protection clause in the asset purchase agreement and thereby reducing the principal amount of the award to  the company paid the principal plus interest as well as the claimant s attorney fees and reimbursement of litigation costs 
the claimant thereafter asked the los angeles county superior court to correct and confirm the interim award 
on september   the court denied the plaintiff s motion 
the claimant then filed an appeal of the denial with the court of appeal  second appellate district 
the company filed its response brief on june  on october   the court of appeal reversed the superior court s denial of the claimant s motion

see note to the consolidated financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of westaff  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
cautionary statement in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
this notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern  liquidity and financing  credit facilities and related debt covenants  workers compensation and unemployment insurance costs  sales  gross margin  goodwill and long lived asset impairment  selling and administrative expenses  interest expense  income taxes  capital expenditures  capital resources and medical operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are made based on information available as of the date hereof  actual results may differ materially 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
the forward looking statements included herein are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties appear in item  factors affecting future operating results 
due to those factors  it is possible that in some future period the company s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in addition  the company s results of operations have historically been subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
liquidity on january  the company was notified by its lending agent that at november   it was in violation of its minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant under its multicurrency credit agreement 
furthermore  the lending agent informed the company that it would be required to amend its credit agreement to waive the covenant violation as well as to address certain other aspects of the credit facility  including increasing the cost of funds and reducing the amount of borrowings available to the company 
the company has significant working capital requirements and is near capacity of its current borrowing agreements which results in significant pressure on the liquidity of the company 
the company has been working with its lenders on an amendment to the credit agreement  but has not yet reached an agreement on the final terms of the amendment 
failure to obtain an amendment to the agreement would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see liquidity and capital resources for a more complete discussion of the company s financing issues  cash positions  sources and uses of cash  including potential additional sources of cash  borrowing arrangements and other risks and uncertainties surrounding the company s liquidity 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company discontinued its medical operations western medical  principally through a sale to intrepid usa intrepid 
under the terms of the sale  the company retained the majority of accounts receivable  including trade and medicare accounts receivable balances 
during fiscal  the company recorded after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share  primarily due to an unfavorable arbitration award between the company and intrepid 
prior to fiscal  the company appealed western medical s medicare cost report settlement 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the appeal was settled and western medical received additional cost reimbursements 
as a result of the favorable appeal settlement  the company recognized  of income from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal currently  the company believes its reserves of million are adequate for remaining estimated liabilities related to the medical business  which primarily relate to pending legal or malpractice liability claims 
however  if actual resolution costs differ materially from those estimated by management  the company would record additional losses or gains in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis by management and generally affect revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  income taxes  including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by management s assumptions or the use of estimates  and are important to the understanding of its business operations and results from operations 
revenue recognition 
the company accounts for revenues and the related direct costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross versus net as an agent 
revenues generated by franchise agents and related costs of services are included as part of the company s consolidated revenues and costs of services  respectively  since the company has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company also has a licensing program in which the licensee has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  sales and costs of services generated by the license operation are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
fees are paid to the company based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by the company as license fees and included in revenues 
as of november   the company had only one remaining licensee and is no longer offering license agreements to new prospects 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable for projected estimated losses as a result of the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances  which are million and million at november   and november   respectively  are largely determined based on customers financial conditions  the company s historical experience  interactions with customers and industry trends 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate to the point it would impair their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances would be required  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
workers compensation costs 
the company self insures the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  which is million per claim increasing to million per claim in fiscal  and maintains accruals for these obligations 
the company accrues the estimated costs of these claims based upon the expected loss rates incurred within the various temporary employment categories provided by the company 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the resulting calculation is partially based on the company s historical loss development trends as well as overall industry trends 
as a result of updates in the actuary s valuation  revisions may be made to recorded liabilities 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual loss rates may exceed projected loss rates  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of workers compensation costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but instead will be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test upon initial adoption of the statement  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
fair value based tests will then be conducted at least annually thereafter 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company utilizes an independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of its individual reporting units 
the valuation methodologies included analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  publicly traded companies multiples within the temporary staffing industry and historical control premiums paid by acquirers purchasing companies similar to westaff 
as a result of the initial impairment tests  the company recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in its australia operations 
no additional impairment was recorded as a result of the company s subsequent annual test which was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal see results of operations impairment of intangible assets and note goodwill in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
long lived assets 
effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s primary long lived assets are property and equipment 
sfas no 
requires a company to assess the recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
additionally  the new standard requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date 
the company did not record any impairment charges for long lived assets during fiscal income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at november   all of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance which amounted to million 
the company cannot be certain that it will be more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in the future years 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions 
the principal risks that the company insures against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and actions is probable and reasonably estimable  the company records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal year revenues costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from sales of affiliate operations impairment of intangible assets arbitration award restructuring charges operating loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle less than fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues include sales of services and license fees 
total revenues increased million  or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the effect of favorable exchange rates on international sales of services 
increases in revenues as a result of an increase in average bill rates were substantially offset by a decrease in bill hours 
sales of services declined domestically 
the domestic decline in sales is largely attributable to a reduction in sales for certain high volume  low margin government business  as well as the lingering effects of the recent us economic downturn which has decreased demand for staffing services and continues to place competitive pricing pressures on bill rates 
based on monthly employment statistics from the bureau of labor statistics  average monthly employment for the staffing industry increased during fiscal the sales decline also reflects the company s continued closure or consolidation of underperforming branches 
international sales of services increased 
excluding the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  international sales increased with increases of in the united kingdom and in australia offset by net declines in the other international operations 
license fees are charged to licensed offices based either on a percentage of sales or a percentage of gross profit generated by the license offices 
license fees were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of services 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal is primarily due to decreases in the average markup of bill rates over pay rates  due largely to the highly competitive environment surrounding the temporary staffing industry during fiscal the decline in gross margin was also caused by higher state unemployment insurance costs  most notably in the states of california  illinois and texas which comprise approximately of total domestic temporary payroll  and increases in workers compensation costs 
the company expects its state unemployment insurance rates to further increase in fiscal overall  unemployment insurance rates in many states have been adversely impacted by the high levels of unemployment since early many states have seen consecutive years of declines in their trust funds and some states have been forced to borrow money from the federal government to continue paying benefits 
it is currently anticipated that the company s state unemployment rates may continue to rise beyond fiscal additionally  the company may continue to experience rising workers compensation costs due to unfavorable loss development trends and continued increases in medical costs 
if the company is unable to mitigate the impact of rising state unemployment or workers compensation costs through increases in revenues or decreases in other costs of services  the company could experience further declines in gross margin 
workers compensation costs rose to million  or of direct labor for fiscal  up from million  or of direct labor for fiscal continued upward trends in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate costs for all open policy years have resulted in an increase in the company s workers compensation accruals for these estimated costs 
although the frequency of the company s claims has decreased  rising medical costs and the adverse development of several open claims have resulted in the need for increased accruals in fiscal the company currently estimates that the accrual rates for workers compensation costs will be in the range of to of direct labor for fiscal these estimates are based on management s forecasts  historical trends and review of interim and annual actuarial estimates 
at times  actual result variances from forecasts and unexpected loss development trends have caused the company to take additional charges over and above its initial estimated accruals 
these charges amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the franchise agents operation 
franchise agents share of gross profit increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  franchise agents share of gross profit was for fiscal and for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold its operations in hawaii and these were converted to franchise offices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one licensee s operations converted to the franchise agent program and two additional company owned branches were sold and converted to franchise offices 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases  partially offset by higher exchange rates for the international operations  reflect the company s continued efforts to reduce costs through personnel reductions  office closures and controlled spending 
during fiscal  salaries for certain management employees were reduced and the company continued its policies limiting domestic full time employee hiring 
the company currently expects to continue to monitor and reduce its operating expenses where feasible through fiscal unless changes in economic circumstances warrant otherwise 
as a percent of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects the cessation of goodwill amortization under sfas no 
as noted in goodwill under critical accounting policies above  and the sale of the company s administrative headquarters buildings during fiscal income from sales of affiliate operations 
the income from sales of affiliate operations in fiscal resulted from the sale and conversion of two company owned branches to franchise offices 
during fiscal  the company sold its interest in one domestic company owned location to a franchise agent and recognized income from the sale of million 
impairment of intangible assets cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists 
this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is adopted 
if required from the results of step one  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss identified during the transitional evaluation is to be recognized in the first interim period of the year of adoption as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
any impairment loss incurred subsequent to the initial evaluation required by the adoption of sfas no 
is recorded as a charge to earnings in the period in which the loss is incurred 
in completing the first step  the company identified its reporting units 
the carrying value of each was then determined 
using an independent appraisal firm  the fair value of each reporting unit was established based on both the discounted present value of expected future cash flows and the comparable market prices of select competitors 
upon completion of this first step  it was determined that an impairment may have existed in the australia reporting unit and  therefore  the company was required to perform step two 
in completing the second step  the company compared the implied fair value of australia s goodwill to its carrying value and determined that an impairment of million existed 
the impairment was largely the result of a significant decrease in australia s profitability due to the recent global economic recession 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment charge has been classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of its fiscal period ended september   and determined that no additional impairment existed at that date 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 the company s management assessed the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill  under the provisions of sfas no 
by determining whether the projected undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset were less than the carrying value of the asset 
during fiscal  a number of businesses the company acquired over past years were negatively impacted by the economic recession 
based on management s assessment of projected undiscounted future cash flows and estimates of market value based on industry multiples  it was determined that a portion of the carrying amount of goodwill and covenants not to compete related to certain acquisitions had been permanently impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to write down these assets to estimated current net realizable values 
during fiscal  an additional pre tax goodwill impairment of  was charged to operations 
arbitration award 
during fiscal  the company recorded an accrued liability and related pre tax charge of million for the estimated cost of an unfavorable arbitration award  plus other related expenses 
this estimate was based on management s assumptions as to the ultimate outcome of certain future events surrounding the arbitration 
during fiscal  a favorable ruling reduced the arbitration award and the company determined that million of the initial estimated liabilities were no longer needed 
subsequent to that ruling  the claimant filed a motion in superior court seeking to correct the award 
the motion was denied 
the claimant then filed an appeal  and in october  the appellate court reversed the superior court s denial of the claimant s motion 
the company filed a petition for rehearing  which was denied 
in december  the claimant agreed to a settlement of  accordingly  the company recorded a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the costs of the settlement plus estimated related attorney s fees of  interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower debt levels 
interest income decreased million or during the same period as a result of reduced cash levels 
interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal as a result of higher anticipated debt levels 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal consists of international income tax provisions of million partially offset by certain domestic net tax benefits 
at november   the company maintained valuation allowances equivalent to of its outstanding deferred tax assets  which amounted to million 
whereas it is possible that these deferred tax assets may be realized in the future  there is currently insufficient evidence to support reversing all or a portion of the valuation allowance 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues include sales of services and license fees 
total sales of services decreased million  or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal average bill rates increased in fiscal  primarily due to minor inflationary effects in the geographical areas the company operates  but billed hours declined 
fiscal contained fifty two weeks while fiscal contained fifty three  after eliminating the effect of this extra week  billed hours declined as compared to fiscal sales of services declined domestically  increased in the united kingdom and increased in the company s other international operations 
the domestic decline in sales is largely attributable to the united states economic recession  which resulted in decreased demand for staffing services across the majority of the company s domestic locations 
domestic pricing pressures which commenced in the latter portion of fiscal continued throughout fiscal  negatively affecting domestic sales of services 
sales of services in the united kingdom increased primarily due to favorable exchange rates and an increase in average bill rates of  which was largely offset by a decrease in billable hours of 
similarly  other international sales of services increased due to changes in exchange rates and an increase in average bill rates of  offset by a decrease in billable hours of 
license fees decreased million or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the number of licensees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  one of the company s remaining licensees converted to the franchise agent program 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its three remaining licensees 
cost of services 
costs of services decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal is primarily due to the overall effects of the domestic recession  which caused significant pricing pressures throughout fiscal additionally  a decrease in direct placement revenues of million and a decrease in license fees of million caused a million decrease in gross profit 
workers compensation costs were million  or of direct labor for fiscal and million  or of direct labor fiscal franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  franchise agents share of gross profit was for both fiscal and all of the company s franchise operations are located within the united states and the gross profit generated from these operations experienced a similar decline as the overall decline in the company s gross profit during fiscal this decline in gross profit from franchise agents caused the franchise agents share of gross profit to decline accordingly 
selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percent of revenues  selling and administrative expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  decreased from in fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to cost savings realized from personnel reductions and office closures implemented early in fiscal income from sales of affiliate operations 
income from sales of affiliate operations decreased million  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company sold its interest in one domestic operation to a franchise agent 
this operation had been previously developed and operated as a company owned location 
in fiscal  the company sold its interests in two larger affiliate operations to the respective licensors  generating much larger comparative income 
restructuring charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve the company s profitability 
this restructuring plan resulted in a fiscal first quarter pre tax charge of million 
the plan included costs associated with the abandonment of certain management information systems which were under development of million  severance and other termination costs of million and lease termination costs of million  related to the company s announced layoffs and office closures 
interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower debt levels 
interest income decreased million or during the same period as a result of reduced cash levels 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million during fiscal this income tax benefit was primarily the result of the reversal of million of a deferred tax valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was reversed because of a change in the tax law that extended the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years 
this change allowed the company to carry losses back to earlier tax years  resulting in additional tax refunds 
additionally  a tax benefit on the current year pre tax loss was recognized due to the ability to carry this loss back at the federal statutory rate of  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
partially offsetting these two benefits were certain state and international income tax provisions amounting to million 
at november   the company maintained valuation allowances equivalent to of its outstanding net deferred tax assets  which amounted to million 
liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity risks and fiscal outlook on january  the company was notified by its lending agent that at november   it was in violation of its minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant under its multicurrency credit agreement 
furthermore  the lending agent informed the company that it would be required to amend its credit agreement to waive the covenant violation as well as to address certain other aspects of the credit facility  including increasing the cost of funds and reducing the amount of borrowings available to the company 
as a result of the untimely notification to the company of the covenant violation  which was inconsistent with previous representations made to the company regarding the covenants  the company filed for an extension for filing its annual report on form k to provide additional time to negotiate an acceptable amendment 
since january  the company has been working with its lenders on an amendment to the credit agreement  but has not yet reached an agreement on the final terms of the amendment 
as of february   the proposed terms of the amendment would waive the covenant violation  reset ebitda and fixed charge coverage covenants and establish a separate ebitda covenant for the us operations on a stand alone basis 
the proposed terms of the amendment would also increase the cost of funds and place immediate and stringent reductions in the company s borrowing capacity  with further reductions scheduled for april through july of the company requires significant amounts of working capital to operate its business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
based on the proposed terms of the amendment and management s current operating and cash flow forecasts  management estimates that it would be reasonably likely that the company may not be able to meet its working capital requirements in three to six months without additional sources of capital 
the company estimates that the additional capital that would be required to meet its working capital needs through the end of fiscal would be in the range of million to million 
additional capital may be required in fiscal the proposed terms of the amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement include a reduction in the amount of trade accounts receivable eligible to be considered for borrowing capacity  changes in availability reserves  a million five month term loan  and an increase of in the margins on outstanding irrevocable letters of credit 
as of january   total borrowing availability was million  with million  million and million available in the us  uk and australia  respectively 
under the terms of the proposed amendment  the company estimates borrowing availability in the us would immediately be reduced by million and borrowing availability in the uk would be increased by million 
the company anticipates that the uk will utilize this increase in their borrowing capacity to declare and pay a dividend of approximately million to the us in the second quarter of fiscal the amount the company is entitled to borrow under its current and proposed amended us revolving credit facility is calculated each day and is dependent on the trade accounts receivable generated from operations  which are affected by financial  business  economic and other factors  as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows 
as a result  the company may be subject to cash shortfalls 
if such a shortfall were to occur  for even a brief period of time  it may have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
the proposed million term loan has an interest rate of libor plus with a principal payment stream of million on april   million on may   million on june  and million on july  the company is aggressively seeking alternative financing and is working with a financial advisor to explore this and other strategic alternatives to increase its available capital 
the company is currently involved in several discussions regarding such alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its available capital or obtain adequate alternative financing  and if alternative financing were obtained  that the cost of such financing would not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in completing an amendment on the terms as currently proposed by its lenders 
while the company currently believes that it will be successful in completing an amendment to its credit agreement based generally on the terms referred to above  should the company not be successful in negotiating an amendment it would remain out of compliance with the agreement and its lenders could demand payment of all outstanding obligations 
the company would be forced to immediately seek refinancing to meet payment of these obligations and such refinancing may not be attainable  or the increased cost of obtaining such refinancing may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
due to the company s inability to obtain the necessary amendment as of the date of the filing of this form k  and the financing issues discussed above  its ability to continue as a going concern may be impaired 
the consolidated financial statements included in this form k do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the company is managing its cash availability by aggressively working to collect cash and by adjusting the timing of cash outflows to help mitigate potential cash shortfalls 
the company also works with key vendors to spread out the timing of certain commitments throughout the year to balance its cash needs 
finally  the company has worked aggressively to reduce operating costs where possible and will continue to identify potential cash savings in the coming year 
in particular  the company is focusing on the very high costs associated with operating as a public company and is evaluating opportunities to reduce such costs 
in addition to managing the cash inflow and outlays  the company can also balance its worldwide cash needs through loans and dividends to and from its international subsidiaries 
these loans and dividends are limited by the immediate and future cash availability and needs of each respective subsidiary  terms under the company s senior secured debt facilities and  in some cases  statutory regulations of the subsidiary 
presently  the company s uk operation is the only international operation with potential cash that could be made available to the us 
in january and february  the uk operations declared and paid dividends to the us of  and  respectively 
as noted above  the company anticipates an additional dividend of approximately million to be paid by the uk to the us in the second quarter of fiscal the company has also generated cash in the past through sales and sale leasebacks of property and equipment 
on february  the company completed the sale of its remaining unoccupied corporate headquarters building for estimated cash proceeds of million 
following the sale of this building the company believes that there are no further asset sales or sale leasebacks that would generate significant amounts of cash 
the company has also generated cash in prior years through the sale of company owned offices to franchise owners or through the sale of franchise agent and license offices back to the franchise agent or license owner 
during fiscal  and  the company generated cash proceeds of  million and million  respectively  from these types of transaction 
the company currently has no specific company owned  franchise or license office sales pending or planned 
as discussed more fully below  the company s founder has in the past loaned funds to the company to provide working capital 
in december  the company s founder loaned million to the company in connection with the required payout for the synergy arbitration award see item legal proceedings and results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal arbitration award 
currently  the company does not anticipate any additional loans from the company s founder 
the company has in the past worked with its insurance carrier to modify the amount and type of collateral required in support of the company s workers compensation obligations 
in some cases  the company s insurance carrier has agreed to reduce letter of credit obligations rather than reduce surety bonds to help support the company s cash position 
reductions to letters of credit increase the company s borrowing availability dollar for dollar while reductions to the surety bond do not 
the company s insurance carrier has  in the past  agreed to review collateral requirements mid year to determine if a reduction in the collateral requirements is feasible 
the company s current insurance policy agreement provides for a million reduction to the collateral effective january   to be applied to the million outstanding surety bonds 
the company s insurance carrier has also agreed to reduce the outstanding letters of credit by million effective february  furthermore  the company s insurance carrier has agreed to reevaluate collateral requirements in may  which may result in further reduction to the surety bond or letters of credit 
however  in the event of a future potential cash shortfall  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining further reductions to its collateral or letters of credit requirements 
as noted above  in addition to its borrowings under debt facilities  the company s liquidity is dependent upon a variety of factors including its operating performance  accounts receivable  the timing of cash inflow and outlays and other economic factors  many of which are outside the control of management 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face potential cash shortfalls  which  even if for a short period of time  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
if the company were to experience significant or prolonged cash shortfalls  the company would need to pursue additional debt or equity financing  however there can be no assurance that such alternatives could be obtained 
general discussion of liquidity and capital resources the company s traditional use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth and during periods where sales are seasonally high throughout the year 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
historically  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated by operating activities and through various forms of debt and equity financing  however  the company has also generated cash through other means as discussed above 
net cash used provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal cash used by operating activities reflects the company s prepayment of its policy year workers compensation obligations million of which was paid during fiscal the net loss of million and a growth in accounts receivables generated by current year s sales exceeding collections during the year 
partially offsetting these are receipt of income tax refunds and non cash expenses 
during fiscal  the company generated cash from operations in spite of a net loss primarily because a number of expenses were non cash charges 
cash generated from operations decreased million as compared fiscal primarily because during fiscal  collection of outstanding receivables outpaced the growth of receivables generated as a result of declining sales levels largely attributable to the domestic recession 
cash used for capital expenditures  which are primarily for information systems hardware and software and office furniture and equipment  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company continues to invest in enhancements and upgrades to its computer based technologies  however  capital expenditures are limited under the terms of its senior secured debt facilities and cannot exceed million for fiscal the company received  million and million in cash proceeds during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  from the purchase by two licensees of the company s interest in their licensed operations during fiscal during fiscal  the company received additional proceeds of  from the sale and conversion of company owned offices to franchise agents 
in december  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction whereby the company sold and leased back the land and buildings housing its administrative offices 
the result of the sale was a net pre tax gain of approximately million that the company deferred and is amortizing as an offset to rent expense over the seven year lease term 
a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of million was used to repay the outstanding principal and interest under a term loan of million 
additionally  the company paid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of million on a promissory note payable to the company s president and chief executive officer 
the remainder of the net cash proceeds was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the company s domestic revolving credit facilities 
in connection with the lease agreement  the company issued a million irrevocable standby letter of credit as a security deposit 
also in december  the company entered into a lease transaction for certain information technology equipment 
this lease  which has a term of months  is being accounted for as a capital lease 
as a part of this lease transaction  the company sold equipment that was then leased back 
net proceeds of million on the sale were used to pay down additional outstanding borrowings under the company s domestic revolving credit facility 
on may   the company entered into agreements with ge capital  as primary agent  to provide senior secured credit facilities totaling million 
the facilities comprise a five year syndicated multicurrency credit agreement consisting of a million us revolving loan commitment  a million uk revolving loan commitment us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the agreement  and a million term loan the term loan 
in addition  a five year australian dollar facility agreement the a facility agreement was executed on may   consisting of an a million revolving credit facility us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the agreement 
each agreement includes a letter of credit sub facility 
the us revolving loan commitment provides for an aggregate million commitment subject to a borrowing base calculation on eligible domestic accounts receivable 
direct advances are also limited by outstanding irrevocable standby letters of credit up to a maximum of million 
the uk revolving loan commitment is subject to a borrowing base calculation on eligible westaff uk accounts receivable 
the a facility agreement is also subject to a borrowing base calculation  based on eligible westaff australia accounts receivable 
direct advances are limited by outstanding letters of credit up to a maximum of a million 
overall  the multicurrency credit agreement calls for a commitment fee  payable monthly in arrears  of based on the average daily unused balance of the combined us uk revolving loan commitment 
additionally  a variable margin ranging from to of the total outstanding letters of credit is payable monthly in arrears and the agreement requires an annual fee of of the face amount of each letter of credit which is issued  renewed or extended 
the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
ge capital  in its role as primary agent under the credit facilities  has sole dominion and control over the company s primary us  uk and australia cash receipt accounts 
cash receipts into these accounts are applied against the company s respective outstanding obligations under the facilities  with additional borrowings under the revolving facilities directed into the company s disbursement accounts on a daily basis 
as noted above in overview of liquidity risks and fiscal outlook  the company faces significant pressure on its liquidity  and is aggressively pursuing alternative sources of financing or strategic alternatives to increase its available capital 
the amount westaff is entitled to borrow under its current and proposed amended revolving credit facility is calculated each day and is dependent on the trade accounts receivables generated from operations  which are affected by financial  business  economic and other factors  as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows 
as a result  the company may be subject to cash shortfalls 
if such a shortfall were to occur  for even a brief period of time  it may have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
if receivables drop significantly  additional borrowings may not be allowed under the credit facilities and the company would have to seek other sources of cash to fund its operations 
in addition  the company may be required to repay the loan in part or in full 
the company s receivables may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes  such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities  and the company would be less able to react to changes in market or industry conditions 
during fiscal  the company executed net borrowings of million under its revolving loan commitments  including the australian facility 
at november   the company had approximately million available under the credit facilities  with million in letters of credit outstanding 
in conjunction with the company s december   sale and leaseback of its administrative offices  a prepayment option on the term loan was exercised and the outstanding balance was paid in its entirety 
the credit facilities contain covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
compliance with the ebitda covenants may be significantly impacted by us economic conditions 
additionally  a default in the covenants under the australian facility could trigger a cross default under the multicurrency agreement 
the covenants also generally restrict  limit or  in certain circumstances prohibit the company with respect to payment of dividends  capital expenditures  disposition of assets  incurrence of debt  mergers and acquisitions  loans to affiliates and purchases of investments 
in the past  when the company has been out of compliance with one or more covenants under its current credit facilities  the company has received waivers and amendments with respect to such covenants from its lenders 
however  in the event the company is out of compliance with one or more covenants in the future  there can be no assurance that its lenders would grant a waiver or amendment with respect to those covenants  which could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
in addition to its outstanding letters of credit  the company has an outstanding financial guarantee bond in the amount of million that secures a portion of its workers compensation premium and deductible obligations 
ninety day advance written notice of non renewal is required 
under the terms of the renewal with the company s workers compensation insurance carrier  the bond may be reduced by million as of january  as this bond is not collateralized with any assets of the company  this reduction will not directly result in an increase of the company s borrowing capacity 
the company s insurance carrier has also agreed to reduce the outstanding letters of credit by million effective february  the company has an unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to its principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors in the amount of million with a maturity date of august   and an interest rate equal to an indexed rate as calculated under the company s credit facilities plus seven percent  compounded monthly and payable calendar days after the end of each of the company s fiscal quarters 
the interest rate in effect on november   was 
payment of interest is contingent on the company meeting minimum availability requirements under its credit facilities 
additionally  payments of principal or interest are prohibited in the event of any default under the credit facilities 
on september   the company executed a one year unsecured subordinated draw down note with its principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors 
the note provides for the chairman to make advances to the company upon request  at his sole discretion and with no obligation to do so  in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million outstanding at any one time 
principal and interest on advances are due and payable on the earlier of twenty two business days from the date of the advance or the final maturity date of the draw down note  subject to certain restrictions regarding borrowing capacity and compliances within the company s senior secured credit facilities 
the interest rate on outstanding advances is equal to an indexed rate as calculated under the company s credit facilities plus seven percent  compounded monthly 
on december   the company borrowed million under the draw down note 
in may  the company executed an unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to its president and chief executive officer in the amount of million with a maturity date of august  and provisions for accelerated maturity under certain circumstances 
the accelerated maturity provisions were met in conjunction with the company s december   sale leaseback transaction and on december   the outstanding principal and interest balance on the note was paid 
the company is responsible for and pays workers compensation costs for its temporary and regular employees and is self insured for the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  per claim for fiscal years  and and increasing to  per claim for fiscal each policy year the terms of the agreement with the insurance carrier are renegotiated 
the company is contractually required to collateralize its recorded obligations through the use of irrevocable letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
for its policy year  the company funded the entire estimated costs with cash payments totaling million 
all other open policy years were collaterized with million of the company s outstanding irrevocable letters of credit and the million surety bond discussed above 
workers compensation liabilities at november   and november   were million and million  respectively 
the reduction in the liabilities is primarily the result of the company s pre funding of the policy year 
the company recently completed negotiations for its policy year insurance 
total payments of million will be paid in monthly installments beginning november  in the amounts of million for the first three installments and million for the remaining nine installments 
of these payments  million will serve to cash collaterize the company s obligations in lieu of issuance of additional irrevocable letters of credit 
the company will also make ongoing cash payments for claims for all open policy years except the funded year 
as noted above in results of operations  the company lost an appeal of a previous arbitration award and settled with the claimant for  the payment was made in december  and with this settlement all further obligations of the company with respect to this claim are concluded with the exception of approximately  in outstanding legal fees 
on february  the company completed the sale of its remaining unoccupied corporate headquarters building for estimated cash proceeds of million  which will be used to pay down outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities 
the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations in future fiscal years in millions as of november  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than one fiscal year to fiscal years to fiscal years more than fiscal years credit facilities promissory note operating leases workers compensation policy year capital lease total contractual obligations the credit agreement expires in may  but the company s lenders could require accelerated payment of amounts outstanding under the credit facilities in the event of default on one or more of the debt covenants contained therein 
payments under the promissory and draw down notes are subject to certain restrictions regarding borrowing capacity and compliances within the company s senior secured credit facilities 
workers compensation obligations for policy year are based on estimates 
if actual results differ from these estimates the company could be required to make additional payments to  or receive refunds from  its insurance carrier in years subsequent to on october   the state of california passed the california health insurance act of sb that requires california employers with more than employees to either provide health coverage for their employees and their dependents  or to pay into a state fund for the provision of health coverage by january  the law requires employers to cover a minimum of of the cost of insurance 
the company s temporary payroll for california employees currently represents approximately of total domestic payroll these employees are typically not covered under employer paid health insurance policies 
the company currently pays approximately of the cost of its regular employee insurance  depending on the type of coverage 
as a result of the changing business and governmental environment in california  some believe that this law may be repealed prior to the required implementation date 
in the event that this law is not repealed  these costs will be substantial and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass them onto customers and maintain its current margins 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other states will not enact similar health insurance legislation that could have a material impact on the company 
however  since the adoption of employee retirement income security act erisa several states have attempted to pass mandatory health coverage bills that failed legal challenges under erisa 
currently  hawaii  which adopted mandatory health coverage before the passage of erisa and received a grandfather clause exempting the state from the regulation  is the only other state with mandated employer provided health care 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant with respect to interest income  as its investment portfolio is not material to its consolidated balance sheet 
further  the company currently has no plans to include derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s outstanding liabilities under variable interest rate debt agreements are million at november  interest rates on borrowings under these agreements are based on varying items depending on the specific debt agreement  which include the federal funds rate  the bank s prime rate  libor  the british prime rate and the australian day bank bill swap rate and are contingent on changes in these 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt at november   a change of in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
for the fiscal year ended november   the company s international operations comprised of its revenues and  as of the end of that period  of its total assets 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the company s multicurrency credit facilities  which allow the company s australia and uk subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies  partially mitigate the exchange rate risk resulting from foreign currency denominated net investments in these subsidiaries fluctuating in relation to the us dollar 
the company does not currently hold any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for hedging transaction risks related to foreign currencies
