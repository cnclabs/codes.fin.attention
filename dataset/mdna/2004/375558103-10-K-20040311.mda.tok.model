item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and commercializes therapeutics to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases 
we are a multinational company  with revenues from six approved products and marketing operations in ten countries 
we focus our research and clinical programs on anti infectives 
currently  we market viread tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtriva emtricitabine for the treatment of hiv infection  hepsera adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b infection  ambisome amphotericin b liposome for injection  an antifungal agent  and vistide cidofovir injection for the treatment of cmv retinitis 
roche markets tamiflu oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza  under a royalty paying collaborative agreement with us 
in december  we made the decision to discontinue selling daunoxome daunorubicin citrate liposome injection  a drug approved for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma 
we are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an active product acquisition and in licensing strategy  such as our acquisition of the assets of triangle pharmaceuticals  inc completed in january our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets  target screening and medicinal chemistry 
in addition  we are currently developing clinical stage products to treat hiv infection and chronic hepatitis b 
our operating results for in comparison to were characterized by solid growth in our key hiv drug  viread and represent our second consecutive year of significant increases in total product revenues 
based on independent third party data  viread has become one of the most widely prescribed antiretrovirals in its class of drugs  achieving more new and total prescriptions than competing drugs in the nucleotide nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti market 
as a result of the growth of viread sales  higher than expected ambisome sales and controlled spending  we have generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last two years  with an increase to million in from million in  or year over year growth 
we expect our hiv drug sales to grow in the near term  although we expect it to be at a slower rate than we have experienced in the past two years 
enabling this growth is the increasing importance of once daily regimens in prescribing hiv medications 
the availability of both viread and emtriva acquired from triangle now provide physicians the ability to construct once daily regimens 
operating results for were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of triangle in january we completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline 
triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for hiv  including aids  and the hepatitis b virus hbv 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including cash paid of million for the outstanding stock  the fair value of stock options assumed of million  estimated direct transaction costs of million and employee related costs of million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and represented the fair value of triangle s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
as a result of this transaction and the related in process research and development charge  our operating loss for was million versus operating income of million in this acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired  but also for the opportunity it provided us to create a co formulation of viread and emtriva into a single pill that can be dosed once a day 
if successful  we expect this co formulated product to further grow our hiv franchise 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the triangle acquisition 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi pharmaceuticals  inc in a transaction valued at up to million in cash and osi stock 
this transaction has allowed us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please read risk factors that affect gilead in part i for factors that could cause or contribute to material differences between these forward looking statements and actual results 
the risk factors discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  accrued clinical and preclinical expenses  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products  government rebate programs  such as medicaid reimbursements  and customer incentives  such as cash discounts for prompt payment 
estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs 
estimates for product returns  including new products  are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns 
this includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction  the purchase of third party data to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels and subsequent prescriptions as well as  for new products  a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels 
further  we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary 
expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from months for viread up to months for ambisome in the us if conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives 
this would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered 
for example  between and  we increased our reserve for government discounts on viread sales by more than as a result of our review of historical utilization rates and the impact of a mid year price increase for viread 
we could see similar increases in the future based on our continued reviews of utilization rates and any potential us price increases for viread 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region  and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on the government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market  could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of raw material bad batches experienced in a given year and expectations of production and inventory levels 
we also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches 
we generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins 
we record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs 
most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
during   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of cro costs 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the cro 
initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone  event or total contract completion date 
the expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract 
as a result  we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed under each contract 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary so that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or contracted in scope compared to the original budget while the start up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed price and can vary in length between six months for a single dose phase study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase study 
the average length of contract for and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of viread  hepsera and emtriva 
through december   we have not understated or overstated activity levels for any particular study such that a material adjustment was required 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro at any point in time during the contract  regardless of payment status 
amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods 
we develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities based on significant management judgment 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it were determined that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets related to the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately milion 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
we evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates  changes in interpretation to these laws and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of gilead s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenue of million in  million in and million in included in total revenue are net product sales  royalty revenue and contract revenue  including revenue from research development r d and manufacturing collaborations 
product sales consisted of the following in thousands product sales change change viread ambisome other total product sales product sales increased in compared to primarily due to significant increases in sales of viread for hiv  which was approved for sale in the us in october and the european union in february and has since become an antiretroviral therapy widely prescribed by physicians 
a significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
prior to  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
in january  we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
this reduces  but does not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
losses on these revenue hedges reduced product revenues by million in and million in sales of viread were of total product sales in  compared to of total product sales in and of total product sales in of the viread sales in  million were us sales  an increase of versus  and million were international sales  an increase of versus with the continued market expansion of viread  we expect viread sales in to grow approximately to and be in the range of million to million 
during  we experienced significant fluctuations in us distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers 
as a result  we experienced increased quarter to quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns 
while we have enacted certain policies to reduce this type of purchasing and are in discussions with our key wholesalers  we expect to continue to experience sales volatility for the foreseeable future 
prior to  our revenues were primarily derived from sales of ambisome  which represented of total product sales in and of total product sales in ambisome sales in were million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to on a volume basis  ambisome sales in europe decreased by compared to due to increasing competition 
excluding the impact of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  ambisome sales grew for over the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to volume sales increases in europe  which offset declining sales in the us with the expected increase in competition  we expect ambisome sales for to be lower than and in the range of million to million 
royalty revenue we recorded royalty revenue of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of ambisome in the us by fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with us 
royalty revenue from fujisawa was million in  compared with million in and million in we also recorded royalty revenue of million in  million in and million in related to sales of tamiflu 
we began recognizing royalties from tamiflu in the first quarter of in june  roche received european regulatory approval of tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults 
as it is difficult to estimate third party product sales  we record royalty revenue one quarter in arrears 
due to this lag in reporting  the royalties related to the severe flu epidemic in the us in the fourth quarter of will be recorded in the first quarter of contract revenue total contract revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in and a primary source of contract revenue was our licensing of the selex process patent estate to archemix  which  due to collectibility concerns  we recognized as the cash was received 
this provided contract revenue of million in and million in in  roche made milestone payments of million for the european prophylaxis and treatment approvals of tamiflu  and in made a million milestone payment relating to the development of tamiflu under an r d collaboration agreement 
as of december   we are entitled to additional milestone payments of up to million upon roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones 
in april  gilead and gsk entered into a licensing agreement providing gsk the rights to commercialize hepsera  our antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b  in asia  latin america and certain other territories 
under the agreement  gilead retained rights to hepsera in the us  canada  eastern and western europe  australia and new zealand 
gsk received exclusive rights to develop hepsera solely for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in all of its territories  the most significant of which include china  korea  japan and taiwan 
gsk paid us an up front licensing fee of million and  may pay up to an additional million upon achievement by gsk of certain regulatory  development and commercial milestones 
of this million  million was received for the us approval of hepsera in september and million was received for the canadian approval of hepsera in august gsk also will pay us a royalty on net sales  if any  of hepsera in the gsk territories 
gsk will have full responsibility for development and commercialization of hepsera in gsk s territories 
the million up front fee and million of approval milestone fees have been recorded as deferred revenue with a total of million and million being recognized as contract revenue in and  respectively 
the million balance of deferred revenue at december  will be amortized into contract revenue over the period of our remaining obligations under the agreement  approximately years 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi 
to date  we have received million in cash and million in osi stock from this sale 
under this agreement  we are entitled to additional payments from osi of up to million in either cash or a combination of cash and osi stock if and when osi reaches certain development milestones for nx  the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to osi 
under a related manufacturing agreement  we will produce nx and gs l  the two liposomal products included in the sale at our manufacturing facility in san dimas  california 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement 
in october  we entered into an agreement with archemix corporation relating to our selex technology 
under this agreement  we gave archemix exclusive rights to the selex process  including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements 
archemix paid to us million in and million in and recorded the net amounts of million and million as contract revenue in and  respectively 
as required by our license agreement with ulehi  we paid of the million and million payments to ulehi 
we also received a warrant to purchase  shares of archemix common stock  the value of which is not material 
as required by our license agreement with ulehi  we transferred of this warrant to ulehi at that time 
we have since transferred the remainder of the warrant to ulehi 
in march  we entered into an agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc relating to our proprietary aptamer eye  currently known as macugen 
currently in phase clinical trials  macugen is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  eyetech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of macugen  and  if the product is successfully commercialized  eyetech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product 
eyetech also will be responsible for all research and development costs 
we provided clinical supplies of the product to eyetech through march we received a million up front licensing fee from eyetech in april  which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period 
accordingly  million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in  and million was recognized as revenue in we are also entitled to additional cash payments from eyetech of up to million if and when eyetech reaches certain macugen development milestones 
additionally  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share  the price at which the stock was issued to other investors 
in january  eyetech completed its initial public offering 
we intend to exercise our warrant for shares of common stock and sell the shares subject to a day lock up period 
the fair value of the warrant has been adjusted in the first quarter of as a result of the eyetech public offering 
cost of goods sold the following table indicates cost of goods sold in thousands change change cost of goods sold substantially all of the increase from each year to year period can be attributed to increases in the volume of viread sold  as this product was launched in the us late in the third quarter of gross margins product gross margins were in  compared with in and in the improvement from to and to is primarily driven by product mix as viread  a higher margin product  contributed more significantly to net product sales in each succeeding year 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates also impact gross margins as we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in us dollars 
for example  an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into us dollars  will increase 
in and  gross margins were positively impacted by the weakening us dollar while in  gross margins were negatively impacted by these factors 
since  forward contracts have been used to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  which can reduce the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on our gross margins 
except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the us dollar and the mix of product sales between viread  hepsera and ambisome  we expect gross margins in to remain relatively stable compared to research and development expenses in  r d expenses were of total costs and expenses  excluding purchased in process research and development expense 
in total  r d expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the major components of r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  clinical studies performed by contract research organizations  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase   and clinical trials as well as expanded access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
the following table breaks down research and development expenses into these major components in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development oncology divested total the million increase in r d spending in versus was attributable to increased headcount and the clinical trials associated with the development of emtriva and the co formulation of viread and emtriva 
in addition  during  we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of million that was recorded to research and development expense 
we expect r d expenses in to be approximately million to million  or approximately to higher than expenses  due primarily to costs associated with the development of the fixed dose combination of viread and emtriva 
the million decrease in r d spending in compared to was primarily due to the reduction in expenses associated with the clinical program for viread  which was approved by the fda for sale in the us in october  and the elimination of expenses associated with our oncology program as a result of the sale of that program to osi in december additionally  in we recognized as expense million of a million up front license fee paid to cubist pharmaceuticals related to the european licensing agreement for daptomycin  also known as cidecin  signed in january upon termination of this agreement in september  we recorded million of r d expense  which represented the remaining unamortized asset related to the preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin 
industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes to years an average of years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the us these averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally  although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and  and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have products in development that are in phase studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
completion dates and r d expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
even after successful development and fda approval of a product  we undertake additional studies to try and expand the product s label and market potential 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products  see the risk factors that affect gilead section of item i above 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table highlights selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands change change selling  general and administrative the increase in expenses in compared to is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts  including the expansion of our us and european sales forces and increased infrastructure investments required to support the growth of our business 
the increase in expenses in compared to is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts  including the expansion of our us and european sales forces to support the commercial launches of viread and hepsera 
in  we expect sg a expenses to be approximately million to million  or to higher than levels  primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the continued promotion of viread  emtriva  hepsera and ambisome 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of the net assets of triangle completed in january  we recorded in process research and development expenses of million in the first quarter of the charge was due to triangle s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the remaining efforts for completion of triangle s research and development projects primarily consist of clinical trials  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development  including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials  the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials  and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approvals 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed 
we cannot be certain that emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b  purchased from triangle  will be approved in the us or the european union or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use 
we have terminated our rights with respect to the other potential products that we acquired with the acquisition of triangle 
we also do not yet have approval of the fixed dose combination product containing tenofovir df and emtricitabine 
future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review  which may differ materially from current projections 
the acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized 
emtriva  for example  is a product with many similarities to other existing products 
as a result  it may be difficult to successfully penetrate the market and to achieve significant revenues 
in addition  emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b faces significant uncertainties associated with pricing  efficacy  and the cost to produce that may not be successfully resolved 
as a result  we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of this product  as we did with clevudine and amdoxovir  if we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline 
if these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all  then our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted 
the value of the acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between and using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
asset impairment during  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million on certain of our long lived assets  primarily leasehold improvements  manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
this non cash charge was driven by the decision in december to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in san dimas and discontinue the daunoxome product line 
the impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value 
as the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows  we wrote the carrying value of the long lived assets down to their estimated fair value 
gain on sale of oncology assets in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets  pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property  as well as our boulder  colorado operations  including clinical research and drug development personnel  infrastructure and facilities  to osi 
the pipeline of clinical candidates includes nx liposomal lurtotecan  gs a nucleoside analogue and gs l a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor 
on the closing date  we received million in cash and osi common stock valued at approximately million 
we recorded a non operating gain of million and income taxes of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of this transaction 
loss on sale of marketable securities in july  we sold all of our remaining shares of osi common stock for approximately million 
these shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to osi in december  at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately million 
in connection with the sale of these remaining shares  we recognized a non operating loss of approximately million in the year ended december  gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate in august  we sold our percent interest in proligo llc proligo to degussa corporation for million in cash 
proligo was a joint venture between us and skw americas  inc focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides 
skw americas  a subsidiary of degussa corporation  held the remaining percent of proligo 
the proceeds  net of our investment in proligo  are reflected as an million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate in interest and other income  net we recorded interest and other income of million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in compared to is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of triangle and the purchase of our foster city campus  partially offset by positive cash flow from operations 
the decrease in compared to is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates  partially offset by a higher average cash balance due to positive cash flow from operations and to the proceeds from the sale of the oncology assets to osi 
interest income in will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates  over which we have no control and the level of our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of million in  compared with million in and million in the significant increase in over is due to the full year of interest on our million convertible senior notes  issued in december interest expense for and consisted primarily of interest on the million convertible subordinated notes  which were converted to common stock in december we expect interest expense in to decrease as compared with primarily due to the redemption of the million convertible subordinated notes in december provision for benefit from income taxes our provision for benefit from income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit in includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets 
in december of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets has no impact on our current period cash flows 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets increased reported earnings per share due to the resulting benefit recorded in the statement of operations from the reduction in our valuation allowance 
partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded is income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries  foreign losses at lower rates and the non tax deductibility of the purchased in process research and development charge 
we had significant net operating losses reducing our us liability 
excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance  and the write off of purchased in process research and development  our effective tax rate for was 
for  we expect our effective tax rate to be in the to range for the full year  reflecting a more normalized tax rate going forward 
the income tax expense in and was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses  which reduced our us tax liability 
the significant increases in income tax expense in resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to osi  for which we recorded approximately million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
the provision for was reduced by a change in the us income tax law 
this law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset of alternative minimum taxable income  resulting in a reduction of us income tax recorded in the previous years of million 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate  proligo 
we sold our percent interest in august cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in  we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december   down from million at december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the acquisition of triangle  for which the net cash impact was million  and the purchase of our foster city campus for million 
other major sources and uses of cash included net cash provided by operations of million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of million  partially offset by additional capital expenditures of million 
working capital at december  was  million compared to  million at december  significant changes in working capital during included a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory and a million increase in current deferred tax assets 
the accounts receivable increase was primarily due to increased sales of viread in the us and europe 
the million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of viread inventory to meet increasing sales demand 
the million increase in current deferred tax assets was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets 
the million increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of viread sales growth 
significant changes in current liabilities during included a million increase in accrued liabilities 
the significant components of the million increase in accrued liabilities  exclusive of the assumed liabilities associated with the acquisition of the net assets of triangle  consist of a million increase in other accrued liabilities and a million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by a million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses 
the million increase in other accrued liabilities is primarily due to medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of viread  an increase in our income taxes payable and an increase in the recorded liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts 
the million increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals and the expansion of our sales force 
the million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses is primarily due to decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for viread and hepsera 
in addition to the purchase of our foster city campus  we made capital expenditures of million in  compared to million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth  as well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
capital expenditures related to research and development were between and of the million spent in  to of the million spent in and to of the million spent in we expect our capital spending for to be million to million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher r d spending associated with the pilot plant we are constructing at our foster city facilities 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than gilead s common stock price at the notes issuance date 
the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after june   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets  and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes were convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than gilead s common stock price at the notes issuance date 
gilead called the million convertible subordinated notes for redemption in november and converted them to gilead common stock in december upon the conversion  the million remaining balance of the related debt issuance costs was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the costs associated with our no profit global access program for least developed nations  the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings  such as from our universal shelf registration filing in december for the potential issuance of up to million of our securities  or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the us as well as sales activities in europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
prior to  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
in january  we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of one year or less 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value december  british pound euro the total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the significant increase in outstanding contracts from to can be attributed to our decision to expand the time horizon that we include from three months to twelve months when hedging our forecasted international sales 
this decision was made due to the growth in our international business and the increasing fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily the euro 
interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 
the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at december  dollars in thousands 
years ending december  fair value december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities long term obligations  including current portion average interest rate convertible senior debentures interest rate long term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases net of noncancelable subleases 
the interest portion of payments due is included 
international credit risk our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the growth was primarily due to higher product sales for viread in the us and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  spain  portugal and italy  our accounts receivable balances are significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  spain  portugal and italy totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
at december   past due receivables for these countries were million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that all accounts receivable balances as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  including those due from customers in these four countries  are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition and generally have not required collateral
