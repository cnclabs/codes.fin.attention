introduction progress energy is an integrated energy company  with its primary focus on the end use and wholesale electricity markets 
the company s reportable business segments and their primary operations include o progress energy carolinas electric pec electric primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina  o progress energy florida pef primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of florida  o competitive commercial operations cco engaged in nonregulated electric generation operations and marketing activities primarily in the southeastern united states  o fuels primarily engaged in natural gas production in texas and louisiana  coal mining and related services  and the production of synthetic fuels and related services  both of which are located in kentucky  west virginia  and virginia  o rail services rail engaged in various rail and railcar related services in states  mexico and canada  and o other businesses other engaged in other nonregulated business areas  including telecommunications primarily in the eastern united states and energy services operations  which do not meet the requirements for separate segment reporting disclosure 
in  the company realigned its business segments to reflect the current management structure and assigned new names to the segments to better reflect their operations 
for comparative purposes  and segment information has been restated to align with the organizational and reporting structure 
strategy the company s goals related to its regulated utilities and nonregulated businesses are to continue focusing on achieving their financial objectives  delivering excellent customer satisfaction and continually striving for operational excellence 
the target is to maintain a business mix of approximately regulated and nonregulated business 
a summary of the significant financial objectives or issues impacting progress energy  its regulated utilities and nonregulated operations are addressed more fully in the following discussion 
o progress energy  inc progress energy has several key financial objectives  the first of which is to achieve operating cash flows sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and support its current dividend policy 
any excess cash flow would be used for debt reduction  primarily at the holding company 
in addition  the company seeks to achieve earnings growth through its core regulated utility businesses and through improving returns at its nonregulated businesses 
the company also seeks to maintain ready access to credit markets 
the ability to meet these objectives is largely dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its two regulated utilities 
the regulated utilities contributed million of net income and produced over of consolidated cash flow from operations in in addition  synthetic fuel income of million also contributed significantly to net income 
partially offsetting the net income contribution provided by the regulated utilities and synthetic fuels was a loss of million recorded at corporate  primarily related to interest expense 
while the company s synthetic fuel operations provide significant earnings  the significant amount of cash flow benefits from synthetic fuels will come in the future when deferred tax credits ultimately are utilized 
credits generated but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as alternative minimum tax credits and will provide positive cash flow when utilized 
at december   deferred credits were million 
the company does not anticipate any significant acquisitions in the near term 
progress energy reduced its debt to total capitalization ratio to at the end of as compared to at the end of the company expects to continue to improve this ratio as it plans to reduce total debt through growth in operating cash flow after dividends  ongoing equity issuances and with proceeds from asset sales 
the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately billion in and in progress energy continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings  despite a ratings downgrade in by both moody s and standard poor s 
both these ratings agencies upgraded the company s outlook from negative to stable in the downgrades have not materially affected progress energy s access to liquidity or the cost of its short term borrowings 
o regulated utilities the regulated utilities earnings and operating cash flows are heavily influenced by weather  the economy  demand for electricity related to customer growth  actions of regulatory agencies and cost controls 
both pec electric and pef operate in retail service territories that are forecast to have income and population growth higher than the us average 
new housing starts in both these territories are also expected to exceed the us average 
in recent years  lower industrial sales  primarily at pec electric and mainly related to weakness in the textile sector  have negatively impacted earnings growth 
the company does not expect any significant improvement in industrial sales in the near term 
these combined factors  and assuming normal weather  are expected to contribute to approximately annual kwh sales growth at the utilities through at least the company does not anticipate any significant additional generation expansion to meet this growth other than the previously planned mw combined cycle unit at pef in pec electric and pef continue to monitor progress toward a more competitive environment 
no retail electric restructuring legislation has been introduced in the jurisdictions in which pec electric and pef operate and both operate under rate agreements 
as part of the clean smokestacks bill in north carolina and an agreement with the public service commission of south carolina scpsc  pec electric is operating under a rate freeze in north carolina through and a rate cap in south carolina through pef is operating under a rate agreement in florida through see note of the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the utilities rates 
the utilities will continue to exercise strong financial discipline as it relates to controlling operation and maintenance costs despite expected increases in benefit related costs and insurance expense 
operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital spending in and in o nonregulated businesses the company s primary nonregulated businesses are cco  fuels and progress rail 
cash flows and earnings of the nonregulated businesses are impacted largely by the ability to obtain additional term contracts or sell energy on the spot market at favorable terms  the volume of synthetic fuel produced and tax credits utilized  and volumes and prices of both coal and natural gas sales 
progress energy expects an excess of supply in the wholesale electric energy market for the next several years 
during  cco completed the build out of its nonregulated generation assets bringing cco s total capacity to  mw 
the company has no current plans to expand its portfolio of nonregulated generating plants 
the company has contracts for planned production capacity of in and for both and cco will continue to seek to secure term contracts with load serving entities to utilize its excess capacity 
fuels will continue to develop its natural gas production asset base both as a long term economic hedge for the company s nonregulated generation fuel needs and to obtain a meaningful presence in natural gas markets that will allow it to provide attractive returns for the company s shareholders 
in  fuels anticipates that  with budgeted capital expenditures  it will have a increase in gas production 
the company s majority owned synthetic fuel entities participate in the internal revenue service irs prefiling agreement pfa program 
the pfa program is a program that allows taxpayers to voluntarily accelerate the irs exam process in order to seek resolution of specific issues 
the company has resolved certain issues with the irs and is continuing to work with the irs to resolve any remaining issues 
the company cannot predict when the exam process will be completed or the final resolution of any outstanding matters 
these facilities have private letter rulings plrs from the irs with respect to their synthetic fuel operations 
the company has no current plans to alter its synthetic fuel production schedule as a result of these matters 
the company plans to produce approximately million to million tons of synthetic fuel in through december   the company had generated  million of synthetic fuel tax credits to date including fpc prior to the acquisition by the company 
see additional discussion at synthetic fuel tax credits in the other matters section below and at note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
progress energy continues to look for opportunities to divest of its progress rail subsidiary at an opportune time as it is not considered part of its core business strategy in the future 
the company expects to accomplish the divestiture within the next three years 
progress energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to various risks 
for a complete discussion of these risks see the risk factors section 
results of operations for as compared to and as compared to in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a summarized overview of the company s consolidated earnings which is followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis by business segment 
progress energy in  progress energy s net income was million  a increase from million in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and discontinued operations was million in  a increase from million in net income for increased compared to primarily due to the inclusion in of an impairment of million after tax related to assets in the telecommunications and rail businesses 
the company recorded impairments of million after tax in on an investment portfolio and on long lived assets 
the increase in net income in of million  excluding the impairments  is primarily due to o an increase in retail customer growth at the utilities 
o growth in natural gas production and sales 
o higher synthetic fuel sales 
o absence of severe storm costs incurred in o lower loss recorded in related to the sale of ncng  with the majority of the loss on the sale being recorded in o lower interest charges in partially offsetting these items were the o net impact of the florida rate settlement 
o impact of the change in the fair value of the cvos 
o milder weather in as compared to o increased benefit related costs 
o higher depreciation expense at both utilities and the fuels and cco segments 
o the impact of changes in accounting principles in each of these items is discussed further in the results of operations for the segments below 
basic earnings per share from net income increased from per share in to per share in in part due to the factors outlined above 
dilution related to a november equity issuance of million shares and issuances under the company s investor plus and employee benefit programs in and also reduced basic earnings per share by in net income in decreased from million in the decrease in net income in is primarily due to impairments and other charges related to the telecommunications and rail business operations  the discontinued operations of ncng  the rate case settlement of pef  pec severe storm costs and increased benefit costs 
partially offsetting these items were continued customer growth and usage at the utilities  lower depreciation at pef  impairments in the telecommunications and srs business units  the impact of the change in market value of cvos and the elimination of goodwill amortization in the company s segments contributed the following profit or loss from continuing operations for  and in millions change change pec electric pef fuels cco rail services other total segment profit loss  corporate total income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net income progress energy carolinas electric pec electric contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the slight increase in profits in  when compared to  was primarily due to customer growth  strong wholesale sales during the first quarter of  lower service company allocations and lower interest costs  which were offset by unfavorable weather in  higher depreciation expense and increased benefit related costs 
the increase in profits in  when compared to  was attributable to customer growth  favorable weather in  lower interest charges and the allocation of tax benefits from the holding company partially offset by severe storm costs in december revenues pec electric s electric revenues for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in millions customer class change change residential    commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues    wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues    pec electric s electric energy sales for  and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential    commercial    industrial    governmental    total retail energy sales    wholesale    unbilled total mwh sales    pec electric s revenues  excluding recoverable fuel revenues of million and million in and  respectively  were unchanged from to milder weather in  when compared to accounted for a million retail revenue reduction 
while heating degree days were above prior year  cooling degree days were below prior year 
however  the more severe weather in the northeast region of the united states during the first quarter of drove a million increase in wholesale revenues 
additionally  retail customer growth in generated an additional million of revenues in pec electric s retail customer base increased as approximately  new customers were added in pec s electric revenues  excluding recoverable fuel revenues of million and million in and  respectively  increased million 
during  residential and commercial sales reflected continued growth in the number of customers served by pec electric  with approximately  new customers in sales of energy and revenue increased in compared to for all customer classes except industrial 
increases in retail sales and wholesale sales were also driven by favorable weather during when compared to wholesale sales growth was partially offset by price declines in the wholesale market 
downturns in the economy during  and impacted energy usage within the industrial customer class 
total industrial revenues  excluding fuel revenues  declined during when compared to and during when compared to by million and million  respectively  as the number of industrial customers decreased due to a slowdown in the textile industry  as well as a decrease in usage in the chemical industry 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel expense increased million in  when compared to million in  primarily due to higher prices incurred for coal  oil and natural gas used during generation 
costs for fuel per btu increased for all three commodities during the year 
see movement in prices under average fuel cost summary in part i  item  pec electric fuel and purchased power 
fuel expense increased million in  when compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in generation with a higher percentage of generation being produced by combustion turbines  which have higher fuel costs 
purchased power expense decreased million in  when compared to million in  mainly due to a decrease in the volume purchased as milder weather reduced system requirements and due to the renegotiation at more favorable terms of two contracts that expired during the year 
for  purchased power decreased million  when compared to million in  mainly due to decreases in prices and volumes purchased 
fuel expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses and  as such  changes in expense have no material impact on operating results 
operations and maintenance o m o m expense decreased million in when compared to million in o m expense in included severe storm costs of million 
those costs along with lower service company allocations of million  due to the change in allocation methodology as required by the sec in early  are the primary reasons for decreased o m expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by higher benefit related costs of million 
pec electric incurred o m costs of million related to three severe storms in the ncuc allowed deferral of million of these storm costs 
these costs are being amortized over a five year period  beginning in the months the expenses were incurred 
pec electric amortized million of these costs in which is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated income statement 
o m expense increased million in when compared to million in primarily due to the storm costs of million  which were not deferred 
o m expense in  when compared to  was also negatively impacted by a lower pension credit of million  the establishment of an inventory reserve of million for materials that have no future benefit  increased salaries and benefits and other increases in maintenance and outage support 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in  when compared to million in depreciation and amortization increased million related to the impact of the clean air legislation in north carolina and decreased million related to the impact of the accelerated nuclear amortization program 
both programs are approved by the state regulatory agencies and are discussed further at notes and e to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
in addition  depreciation increased million due to additional assets placed into service 
depreciation and amortization increased million in when compared to million in pec electric recorded million of accelerated amortization expense in and million in related to the nuclear amortization program 
the year over year favorability was offset by additional depreciation recognized in  as compared to  on new assets that were placed in service during pec filed a new depreciation study in that provides support for reducing depreciation expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
the reduction is primarily attributable to assumption changes for nuclear generation  offset by increases for distribution assets 
the new rates are primarily effective january  interest expense net interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
declines in interest expense resulted from reduced short term debt and refinancing certain long term debt with lower interest rate debt 
income tax expense in and  million and million  respectively  of the tax benefit that was previously held at the company s holding company was allocated to pec electric 
as required by an sec order issued in  holding company tax benefits are allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pretax income 
progress energy florida pef contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in profits in  when compared to  was primarily due to the impact of the rate case stipulation  higher benefit related costs primarily related to higher pension expense  higher depreciation and the unfavorable impact of weather 
these amounts were partially offset by continued customer growth and lower interest charges 
the increase in profits in  when compared to  was attributed to the impact of milder weather in as compared to  continued customer growth and the allocation of tax benefits from the holding company 
these items were partially offset by the impact of the rate case stipulation  increased benefits costs and lower pension credit and higher system reliability and enhancement spending 
pef s profits in and were affected by the outcome of the rate case stipulation  which included a one time retroactive revenue refund in  a decrease in retail rates of effective may   provisions for revenue sharing with the retail customer base  lower depreciation and amortization and increased service revenue rates 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement 
revenues pef s electric revenues for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class  as well as the impact of the rate case settlement on revenue  are as follows in millions customer class change change residential    commercial industrial governmental revenue sharing refund retroactive retail rate refund total retail revenues    wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues    pef s electric energy sales for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential    commercial    industrial    governmental    total retail energy sales    wholesale    unbilled total mwh sales    pef s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of  million and  million in and  respectively  increased million from to revenues were favorably impacted by million in  primarily as a result of customer growth approximately  additional customers 
in addition  other operating revenues were favorable million due primarily to higher wheeling and transmission revenues and higher service charge revenues resulting from increased rates allowed under the rate settlement 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of the rate settlement  which decreases revenues  lower wholesale sales and the impact of unfavorable weather 
the provision for revenue sharing increased million in compared to the million provision recorded in revenues in were also impacted by the final resolution of the revenue sharing provisions as the fpsc issued an order in july of that required pef to refund an additional million to customers related to the rate reduction from the settlement accounted for an additional million decline in revenues 
the impact of the rate settlement was partially offset by the absence of the prior year interim rate refund of million 
lower wholesale revenues excluding fuel revenues of million and the million impact of milder weather also reduced base revenues during pef s revenues  excluding fuel revenues of  million and  million in and  respectively  decreased million from to the revenue declines were driven by the million impact of the rate case  comprised of a million one time retroactive refund  a million decrease due to the rate reduction  and an estimated revenue sharing refund of million 
additionally  wholesale revenues excluding fuel revenues declined million  driven primarily by a contract that was not renewed 
year over year comparisons were also unfavorably impacted by the recognition of million of revenue deferred from to partially offsetting the unfavorable revenue impacts was customer growth approximately  additional customers  the impact of weather conditions  primarily a warmer than normal summer in  and an increase in other operating revenue  resulting primarily from higher service charge revenues resulting from increased rates allowed under the rate case settlement  along with higher transmission and wheeling revenues 
expenses fuel and purchased power fuel used in generation and purchased power increased million in when compared to  million in the increase is due to higher costs to generate electricity and higher purchased power costs as a result of an increase in volume due to system requirements and higher natural gas prices 
fuel used in generation and purchased power totaled  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the decrease is primarily due to a lower recovery of fuel expense that resulted from a mid course correction of pef s fuel cost recovery clause  as part of the rate settlement  and lower purchased power costs  partially offset by an increase in coal prices and volume from high system requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses and  as such  changes in expense have no material impact on operating results 
operations and maintenance o m o m expense increased million  when compared to million in the increase is largely related to increases in certain benefit related expenses of million  which consisted primarily of higher pension expense of million and higher operational costs related to the cr nuclear outage and plant maintenance 
o m expense increased million in when compared to million in  due primarily to a reduced pension credit of million  increased costs related to the commitment to excellence program of million and an increase in other salary and benefit costs of million related partially to increased medical costs 
the commitment to excellence program was initiated in to improve service and reliability 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in when compared to million in depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional assets being placed into service that were partially offset by lower amortization of the tiger bay regulatory asset of million  which was fully amortized in september depreciation and amortization decreased million in when compared to million in in addition to the depreciation and amortization reduction of approximately million related to the rate case  depreciation declined an additional million related to accelerated amortization on the tiger bay regulatory asset  which was created as a result of the early termination of certain long term cogeneration contracts 
see note d to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further details on the rate case 
pef amortized the regulatory asset according to a plan approved by the fpsc in interest expense interest charges decreased million in compared to million in primarily due to the reversal of a regulatory liability for accrued interest related to previously resolved tax matters 
income tax expense in and  million and million  respectively  of the tax benefit that was previously held at the company s holding company was allocated to pef 
as required by an sec order issued in  holding company tax benefits are allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pretax income 
diversified businesses the company s diversified businesses consist of the fuels segment  the cco segment  the rail services segment and the other segment  which consists primarily of the energy services operations and telecommunications operations 
fuels fuels segment profits increased million in as compared to million in primarily due to an increase in synthetic fuel earnings  higher natural gas earnings from increased natural gas prices  the addition of north texas gas operations in march and the addition of westchester in april these results were partially offset by an asset impairment during the fourth quarter of million after tax at the kentucky may coal company 
fuels profits as compared to decreased million primarily as a result of lower synthetic fuel production  which was partially offset by increased natural gas revenues as a result of the westchester acquisition 
fuels contributed segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the following summarizes fuels segment profits for the years ended december   and in millions synthetic fuel operations natural gas operations coal fuel and other operations segment profits synthetic fuel operations synthetic fuel operations generated profits of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the production and sale of the synthetic fuel generate operating losses  but qualify for tax credits under section  which more than offset the effects of such losses 
see synthetic fuels tax credits under other matters below for additional discussion of these tax credits 
the operations resulted in the following losses prior to tax credits and tax credits for  and in millions tons sold after tax losses excluding tax credits tax credits net profit synthetic fuels net profits for increased as compared to due to higher sales  improved margins and a higher tax credit per ton 
the tax credits also include a million favorable true up from additionally  synthetic fuels results in include months of operations for some facilities 
prior to the fourth quarter of  results of these synthetic fuels operations had been recognized one month in arrears 
the net impact of this action increased net income by million for the year 
synthetic fuels net profits decreased in compared to due to lower sales 
synthetic fuels net profits decreased million in when compared to the decrease in profits was primarily due to a decline in tons produced as severe storm costs incurred at one of the utilities reduced the company s ability to use the tax credits generated from production 
natural gas operations natural gas operations generated profits of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in production and price resulting from the acquisitions of westchester in and north texas gas in the first quarter of drove increased revenue and earnings in as compared to in october of  the company completed the sale of certain gas producing properties owned by mesa hydrocarbons  llc 
see notes and c to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for discussions of the westchester and the north texas gas acquisitions and the mesa disposition 
the increase in profits of million from to is due to an increase in gas production of as a result of the westchester acquisition in april of the following summarizes the production and revenues of the natural gas operations for  and by facility production in bcf equivalent mesa westchester north texas gas total production revenues in millions mesa westchester north texas gas total revenues gross margin in millions of as a of revenues coal fuel and other operations coal fuel and other operations generated profits of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and coal fuel and other operations segment profits decreased million from to the decrease is due primarily to the recording of an impairment of certain assets at the kentucky may coal mine totaling million after tax 
see discussion of impairment recorded in note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
competitive commercial operations cco generates and sells electricity to the wholesale market from nonregulated plants 
these operations also include marketing activities 
cco s operations generated segment profits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cco s operations were most significantly impacted by placing additional generating capability into service in and the following summarizes the annual revenues  gross margin and segment profits from the cco plants in millions total revenues gross margin in millions of as a of revenues segment profits the increase in revenue for when compared to is primarily due to increased contracted capacity on newly constructed plants  energy revenue from a new  full requirements power supply contract and a tolling agreement termination payment received during the first quarter 
generating capacity increased from  megawatts at december  to  megawatts at december   with the effingham  rowan phase and washington plants being placed in service in in the second quarter of  pvi acquired from williams energy marketing and trading a full requirements power supply agreement with jackson in georgia for million  which resulted in additional revenues of million when compared to the same periods in the revenue increases related to higher volumes were partially offset by higher depreciation costs of million  increased interest charges of million and other fixed charges 
the increase in revenues from to is due to the increase in capacity during the year 
in operations included one nonregulated plant with a megawatt capacity and  at the end of  plants with  megawatts of capacity were operational 
the increase in capacity was due to the transfer of one plant from pec electric  the purchase of one operational plant from lg e energy corp 
see note d to the progress energy consolidated financial statements and one additional plant being placed in service 
the increase in capacity drove the increase in net income 
the earnings potential was offset by general softness in the energy market in the company has contracts representing   and of planned production capacity for through  respectively 
the company is actively pursuing opportunities with current customers and other potential new customers to utilize its excess capacity 
rail services rail services rail operations represent the activities of progress rail and include railcar and locomotive repair  trackwork  rail parts reconditioning and sales  scrap metal recycling  railcar leasing and other rail related services 
rail s results for the year ended december   include rail services cumulative revenues and net loss from the date of acquisition  november   because rail services had been held for sale from the date of acquisition through the second quarter of rail contributed losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss in includes a million after tax estimated impairment of assets held for sale related to railcar ltd  a leasing subsidiary of progress rail 
in march  the company signed a letter of intent to sell the majority of railcar ltd 
assets to the andersons  inc the asset purchase agreement was signed in november and the transaction closed on february  as such  assets of railcar ltd 
have been reported as assets held for sale 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for discussion of this planned divestiture 
excluding the impairment recorded in  profits for rail were flat year over year compared to earnings for rail increased in compared to  excluding the million impairment booked in as discussed above 
rail services results were favorably impacted by aggressive cost cutting  new business opportunities and restructuring initiatives 
rail services results for both years were affected by a downturn in the overall economy and decreases in rail service procurement by major railroads 
a downturn in the domestic scrap market also impacted rail services results for an sec order approving the merger of fpc required the company to divest of progress rail by november  however  the sec has granted an extension until other progress energy s other segment includes the operations of srs  the telecommunications operations of ptc and caronet and the operation of nonutility subsidiaries of pec 
srs is engaged in providing energy services to industrial  commercial and institutional customers to help manage energy costs and currently focuses its activities in the southeastern united states 
telecommunication operations provide broadband capacity services  dark fiber and wireless services in florida and the eastern united states 
in december  ptc and caronet  both wholly owned subsidiaries of progress energy  and epik  a wholly owned subsidiary of odyssey  contributed substantially all of their assets and transferred certain liabilities to ptc llc  a subsidiary of ptc 
subsequently  the stock of caronet was sold to an affiliate of odyssey for million in cash  and caronet became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of odyssey

interest expense increased million in compared to due to a decrease of million in the amount of interest capitalized related to construction at nonregulated generating plants  as construction was completed and plants were placed in service 
the increase in  when compared to  was primarily related to increased debt associated with the purchase of nonregulated generating facilities 
this was partially offset by lower interest rates and million of interest capitalization in related to the building of the nonregulated generating plants 
progress energy issued million cvos in connection with the fpc acquisition 
each cvo represents the right to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuel facilities owned by progress energy 
the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
at december    and  the cvos had a fair market value of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
progress energy recorded unrealized losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  and an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  to record the changes in fair value of cvos  which had average unit prices of   and at december   and  respectively 
as required by an sec order issued in  holding company tax benefits are allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
tax benefits reallocated from the holding company to the profitable subsidiaries increased corporate s income tax expense by million and million in and other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pretax income

progress energy sold ncng and encng for net proceeds of approximately million 
progress energy incurred a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  compared with a loss of million for the loss for reflects the finalization of the sale of ncng 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for more information on this divestiture 
cumulative effect of accounting changes progress energy recorded adjustments for the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles due to the adoption of several new accounting pronouncements 
these adjustments totaled to a million loss after tax which was due primarily to new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to the accounting for certain contracts 
this guidance discusses whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices qualifies for certain exceptions that would not require the contract to be recorded at its fair value 
pec electric had a purchase power contract with broad river llc that did not meet the criteria for an exception  and a negative fair value adjustment was recorded in the fourth quarter of for million after tax 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements and note a to the pec consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in doing so  certain estimates were made that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on the financial results of the company and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
utility regulation the company s regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates the company is permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine the company is permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the changing regulatory framework in each state in which the company operates  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
the company continually reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements provides additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on the company 
asset impairments the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators exist 
examples of these indicators include current period losses combined with a history of losses  or a projection of continuing losses  or a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group 
if an indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations and various factors are considered  including projected revenues and cost and market conditions 
due to the reduction in coal production at the kentucky may coal mine  the company evaluated its long lived assets in and recorded an impairment of million before tax million after tax

during  the company recorded pre tax long lived asset impairments of million related to its telecommunications business 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on this impairment and other charges 
the fair value of these assets was determined using an external valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
the company also continually reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
in  the company s affordable housing investment ahi portfolio was reviewed and deemed to be impaired based on various factors including continued operating losses of the ahi portfolio and management performance issues arising at certain properties within the ahi portfolio 
as a result  the company recorded impairments of million on a pre tax basis during the fourth quarter of the company also recorded an impairment of million for a cost investment 
during and  the company recorded pre tax impairments to its cost method investment in interpath of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of this investment was determined using an external valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
these cash flows included numerous assumptions including the pace at which the telecommunications market would rebound 
in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its remaining interest in interpath for a nominal amount 
goodwill effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further detail on goodwill 
sfas no 
requires a two step goodwill impairment test 
the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test each year 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss if step one indicates a potential impairment  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test  which indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired as of january  the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for reportable segments pec electric  pef and cco  are  million   million and million  respectively 
during  the other segment acquired million in goodwill as part of the ptc business combination with epik 
the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the cco segment in the first quarter of  and the annual goodwill impairment test for the pec electric and pef segments in the second quarter of  which indicated no impairment 
if the fair values for the utility segments were lower by  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
during  the company completed the acquisition of two electric generating projects  walton county power  llc and washington county power  llc 
the acquisitions resulted in goodwill of million 
synthetic fuels tax credits progress energy  through the fuels business unit  produces coal based synthetic fuel 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuel qualifies for tax credits under section if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the feedstock used to produce such synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility that was placed in service before july  any synthetic fuel tax credit amounts not utilized are carried forward indefinitely and are included in deferred taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on the synthetic fuel tax credits 
all of progress energy s synthetic fuel facilities have received plrs from the irs with respect to their operations 
these tax credits are subject to review by the irs  and if progress energy fails to prevail through the administrative or legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section credits  with a significant impact on earnings and cash flows 
pension costs as discussed in note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements  progress energy maintains qualified non contributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
the company s reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to a slight decline in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate  the company lowered the discount rate to at december   which will increase the benefit costs recognized  all other factors remaining constant 
however  after a few years of negative asset returns due to equity market declines  plan assets performed very well in  with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension cost in evaluations of the effects of these factors have not been completed  but the company estimates that the total cost recognized for pension will decrease by approximately million from the amount recorded in  due in large part to these factors 
the company has pension plan assets  with a fair value of approximately billion at december  the company s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
the company reviews this rate on a regular basis 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  the company would only adjust that return if its fundamental assessment of the debt and equity markets changes or its investment policy changes significantly 
the company believes that its pension plans asset investment mix and historical performance support the long term rate of being used 
the company did not adjust the rate in response to short term market fluctuations such as the abnormally high market return levels of the latter s  recent years market declines and the market rebound in a change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension cost by approximately million 
another factor affecting the company s pension cost  and sensitivity of the cost to plan asset performance  is its selection of a method to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
sfas no 
specifies that entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
the company has historically used a five year averaging method 
when the company acquired florida progress corporation florida progress in  it retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension cost sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method and  therefore  pension cost tends to be more volatile using the fair value method 
for example  in the expected return for assets subject to the averaging method was lower than in  whereas the expected return for assets subject to the fair value method was lower than in approximately of the company s pension plan assets is subject to each of the two methods 
liquidity and capital resources overview progress energy is a registered holding company and  as such  has no operations of its own 
as a holding company  progress energy s primary cash obligations are its common dividend and interest expense associated with billion of senior unsecured debt 
the ability to meet its obligations is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its two electric utilities and nonregulated subsidiaries  and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to progress energy 
other significant cash requirements of progress energy arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of its electric utility operations as well as the expansion of its diversified businesses  primarily those of the fuels segment 
progress energy relies upon its operating cash flow  generated primarily by its two regulated electric utility subsidiaries  commercial paper facilities and its ability to access long term capital markets for its liquidity needs 
since a substantial majority of progress energy s operating costs are related to its two regulated electric utilities  a significant portion of these costs are recovered from customers through fuel and energy cost recovery clauses 
as a registered holding company under public utility holding company act of puhca  progress energy obtains approval from the sec for the issuance and sale of securities as well as the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit utility and nonutility money pools 
pec and pef participate in the utility money pool  which allows the two utilities to lend and borrow between each other 
progress energy can lend money into the utility money pool but cannot borrow funds 
the nonutility money pool was established to allow progress energy s nonregulated operations to lend and borrow funds amongst each other 
progress energy can also lend money to the nonutility money pool but cannot borrow funds 
during  the company realized approximately million of net cash proceeds from the sale of ncng and encng 
the company also received net proceeds of approximately million in october for the sale of its mesa gas properties located in colorado 
progress energy used the proceeds from these sales to reduce indebtedness  primarily commercial paper  then outstanding 
on march   progress energy used available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to retire million senior unsecured notes 
cash and commercial paper capacity were created primarily from the sale of the assets in as noted above 
for the months ended december   the company received approximately million of net proceeds through the sale of million shares of common stock issued through the progress energy direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan  and its k savings and stock ownership plan 
the company expects to reduce the issuance of common stock in progress energy s cash from operations and common stock issuances in is expected to fund its capital expenditures 
to the extent necessary  incremental borrowings or commercial paper issuances may also be used as a source of liquidity 
progress energy believes its internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund its current business plans 
risk factors associated with commercial paper backup credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below and in the risk factors section of this report 
the following discussion of progress energy s liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
cash flows from operations cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
total cash from operations for was billion  compared to billion in the increase in cash from operating activities for when compared with is largely the result of improved operating results at pec 
total cash from operations for was billion  up million from progress energy s two electric utilities produced over of consolidated cash from operations in it is expected that the two electric utilities will continue to produce a majority of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years as its nonregulated investments  primarily generation assets  improve asset utilization and begin generating operating cash flows 
in addition  fuels synthetic fuel operations do not currently produce positive operating cash flow primarily due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and when tax credits are realized for tax purposes 
total cash from operations provided the funding for approximately of the company s capital expenditures  including property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and diversified business property additions during  excluding proceeds from asset sales of million 
progress energy expects its operating cash flow to exceed its projected capital expenditures and common dividends beginning in and current plans are to use the excess cash flow to reduce debt 
investing activities excluding proceeds from sales of subsidiaries and investments  cash used in investing activities was billion in  down approximately million when compared with the decrease is due primarily to lower utility property additions due to completion of hines construction at pef and lower acquisitions of nonregulated assets 
cash used in investing was billion in  up million when compared with the increase was due primarily to pvi purchasing two generating projects from lg e energy corp 
for approximately million 
capital expenditures for progress energy s regulated electric operations were billion or approximately of consolidated capital expenditures in  excluding proceeds from asset sales 
as shown in the table below  the company anticipates that the proportion of nonregulated capital spending to total capital expenditures will decrease substantially in when compared with the decrease reflects the completion of pvi s nonregulated generation portfolio in progress energy expects the majority of its capital expenditures to be incurred at its regulated operations 
forecasted nonregulated expenditures relate primarily to progress fuels and its gas operations  primarily for drilling new wells 
in millions actual forecasted regulated capital expenditures   nuclear fuel expenditures afudc borrowed funds nonregulated capital expenditures total     regulated capital expenditures in the table above include total expenditures from through of approximately million expected to be incurred at pec fossil fueled electric generating facilities to comply with section of the clean air act  referred to as the nox sip call 
see note e to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
in june  legislation was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide so from coal fired power plants 
pec expects its capital costs to meet these emission targets will be approximately million by for the years through  the company expects to incur approximately million of total capital costs associated with this legislation  which is included in the table above 
see note e to the progress energy consolidated financial statements and current regulatory environment under other matters below for more information on this legislation 
in  pec determined that its external funding levels did not fully meet the nuclear decommissioning financial assurance levels required by the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
the funding levels had been adversely affected by the declines in the equity markets 
the total shortfall was approximately million dollars for robinson unit no 
 million dollars for brunswick unit no 
and million dollars for brunswick unit no 
pec met the financial assurance requirements by obtaining a parent company guarantee 
the funding status for these facilities would be positively affected by a continuing recovery in the equity markets and by the approval of license extension applications 
pec retains funds internally to meet decommissioning liability 
the ncuc order issued february found that by january  pec must begin transitioning these amounts to external funds 
the transition of million must be completed by december   and at least must be transitioned each year 
pec has exclusively utilized external funding for its decommissioning liability since all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends 
financing activities cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales exceeded property and fuel additions by approximately million 
the excess  when combined with million of net cash generated from the sale of common stock  resulted in an increase of cash and cash equivalents of million after paying common dividends 
as of december   on a consolidated basis  the company had million of long term debt maturing in  million of which was prefunded through issuances of long term debt in on march   progress energy funded the maturity of its million senior unsecured notes with cash on hand and commercial paper 
on january   pec funded the maturity of million first mortgage bonds with commercial paper proceeds 
pec also has million first mortgage bonds maturing on april  it plans to use commercial paper proceeds to fund this maturity 
during  both pec and pef took advantage of historically low interest rates and refinanced several issues of debt 
in february  pef issued million of first mortgage bonds  series  due march  and million of first mortgage bonds  series  due march  proceeds from this issuance were used to repay the balance of its outstanding commercial paper  to refinance its secured and unsecured indebtedness  including million of pef s first mortgage bonds  series  due december  at of the principal amount of such bonds 
on march   million of pef s first mortgage bonds  series  due march   matured 
pef funded the maturity with commercial paper 
on may   pec redeemed million of first mortgage bonds  series  due march  at of the principal amount of such bonds 
pec funded the redemption with commercial paper 
on july   million of pef s first mortgage bonds  series  due july  and million of pef s medium term notes  series  matured 
pef funded the maturity with commercial paper 
on august   pec redeemed million of first mortgage bonds  series  due august  at 
pec funded the redemption with commercial paper 
on september   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series  due september  and million of first mortgage bonds  series  due september  proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce the balance of pec s outstanding commercial paper and short term notes payable to affiliated companies  which notes represent pec s borrowings under the internal money pool operated by progress energy 
on november   pef issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due december  proceeds from this issuance were used to refinance million of pef s first mortgage bonds  series  due at of the principal amount of such bonds and to reduce the outstanding balance of its notes payable to affiliates 
the amount of debt issued by pec and pef in september and november  respectively  took into consideration debt maturities and other financing needs for as such  neither pec nor pef anticipate the need to issue long term debt in in march  progress genco ventures llc genco  a wholly owned subsidiary of pvi  terminated its million working capital credit facility 
under a related construction facility  genco has drawn million at december  during  progress energy obtained a new three year financing order which will expire september  under the new order  progress energy  the holding company  can issue up to billion of long term securities  billion of short term debt and billion of parent guarantees 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had committed lines of credit totaling billion  for which there were no loans outstanding 
all of the credit facilities supporting the billion of credit were arranged through a syndication of commercial banks 
there are no bilateral contracts associated with these facilities 
these lines of credit support the company s commercial paper borrowings 
the following table summarizes the company s credit facilities in millions company description total progress energy  inc day expiring progress energy  inc year expiring progress energy carolinas  inc day expiring progress energy carolinas  inc year expiring progress energy florida  inc day expiring progress energy florida  inc year expiring total credit facilities  the company s financial policy precludes issuing commercial paper in excess of its supporting lines of credit 
at december   the company did not have any commercial paper outstanding  leaving billion available for issuance 
in addition  the company had requirements to pay minimal annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities 
at december   the total amount of commercial paper outstanding was million 
in addition  these credit agreements and genco s million bank facility contain various terms and conditions that could affect the company s ability to borrow under these facilities 
these include a maximum debt to total capital ratio  an interest coverage test  a material adverse change clause and cross default provisions 
all of the credit facilities and genco s bank facility include a defined maximum total debt to total capital ratio leverage and coverage ratios 
at december   the calculated ratios for these four companies  pursuant to the terms of the agreements  are as follows maximum actual minimum actual leverage leverage a coverage coverage company ratio ratio ratio ratio progress energy  inc progress energy carolinas  inc n a n a progress energy florida  inc progress genco ventures  llc a indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements includes certain letters of credit and guarantees which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the credit facilities of progress energy  pec  pef and genco include a provision under which lenders could refuse to advance funds in the event of a material adverse change in the borrower s financial condition 
each of these credit agreements contains cross default provisions for defaults of indebtedness in excess of million 
under these provisions  if the applicable borrower or certain subsidiaries of the borrower fail to pay various debt obligations in excess of million  the lenders could accelerate payment of any outstanding borrowing and terminate their commitments to the credit facility 
progress energy s cross default provision only applies to progress energy and its significant subsidiaries ie  pec  florida progress  pef  progress capital holdings  inc pch  pvi and progress fuels 
additionally  certain of progress energy s long term debt indentures contain cross default provisions for defaults of indebtedness in excess of million  these provisions only apply to other obligations of progress energy  primarily commercial paper issued by the holding company  not its subsidiaries 
in the event that these indenture cross default provisions are triggered  the debt holders could accelerate payment of approximately billion in long term debt  as of march  certain agreements underlying the company s indebtedness also limit its ability to incur additional liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions 
the company has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which senior notes  junior debentures  common and preferred stock and other trust preferred securities are available for issuance by the company 
at december   the company had approximately billion available under this shelf registration 
progress energy and pef each have an uncommitted bank bid facility authorizing each of them to borrow and re borrow  and have loans outstanding at any time  up to million and million  respectively 
at december   there were no outstanding loans against these facilities 
pec currently has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it can issue up to million of various long term securities 
pef currently has on file registration statements under which it can issue an aggregate of million of various long term debt securities 
both pec and pef can issue first mortgage bonds under their respective first mortgage bond indentures 
at december   pec and pef could issue up to billion and billion based on property additions and billion and million based upon retirements 
the following table shows progress energy s and progress energy carolinas capital structure at december  and progress energy pec common stock preferred stock total debt the amount and timing of future sales of company securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow  asset sales and the specific needs of the company 
the company may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount needed to meet capital requirements in order to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other general corporate purposes 
credit rating matters the major credit rating agencies have currently rated the company s securities as follows moody s investors service standard poor s fitch ratings progress energy  inc corporate credit rating not applicable bbb not applicable senior unsecured baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a not applicable progress energy carolinas  inc corporate credit rating not applicable bbb not applicable commercial paper p a f senior secured debt a bbb a senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb progress energy florida  inc corporate credit rating not applicable bbb not applicable commercial paper p a f senior secured debt a bbb a senior unsecured debt a bbb bbb fpc capital i preferred stock baa bb not applicable progress capital holdings  inc senior unsecured debt a bbb not applicable guaranteed by florida progress corporation these ratings reflect the current views of these rating agencies and no assurances can be given that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  the company monitors its financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect its credit ratings 
the company and its subsidiaries debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any ratings triggers  which would cause the acceleration of interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
however  in the event of a downgrade  the company and or its subsidiaries may be subject to increased interest costs on the credit facilities backing up the commercial paper programs 
the company and its subsidiaries have certain contracts which have provisions that are triggered by a ratings downgrade 
these contracts include counterparty trade agreements  derivative contracts  certain progress energy guarantees and various types of third party purchase agreements 
none of these contracts would require any action on the part of progress energy or its subsidiaries unless the ratings downgrade results in a rating below investment grade 
the power supply agreement with jackson electric membership corporation that pvi acquired from williams energy marketing and trading company see part i  item  general  wholesale energy contract acquisition included a performance guarantee that progress energy assumed 
in the event that progress energy s credit ratings fall below investment grade  progress energy will be required to provide additional security for its guarantee in form and amount acceptable to jackson 
see progress energy  inc risk factors for additional discussion 
in february  moody s investors service announced that it was lowering progress energy  inc s senior unsecured debt rating from baa to baa  and changing the outlook of the rating from negative to stable 
moody s cited the slower than planned pace of the company s efforts to pay down debt from its acquisition of florida progress as the primary reason for the ratings change 
moody s also changed the outlook of pef a senior secured and pch a senior unsecured from stable to negative and lowered the trust preferred rating of fpc capital i from a to baa with a negative outlook 
also in february  fitch ratings service assigned an initial rating to progress energy s senior unsecured debt of bbb 
no short term rating was assigned 
fitch also downgraded the ratings of pef and pec 
pef s senior secured rating was changed to a from aa and its senior unsecured rating was changed to bbb from a 
pef s short term rating was changed to f from f 
pec s senior secured rating was changed to a from a and its senior unsecured rating was changed to bbb from a 
pec s short term rating was changed to f from f fitch s outlook for all three rated entities is stable 
in august  standard poor s s p credit rating agency announced that it had lowered its corporate credit rating on progress energy inc  pec  pef  and florida progress to bbb from bbb 
the outlook of the ratings was changed from negative to stable 
these changes have not had a material impact on the companies access to capital or their financial results 
interest rate derivatives progress energy uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the fixed and variable rate debt components of its debt portfolio 
the company s long term objective is to maintain a debt portfolio mix of approximately variable rate debt  fixed rate 
at december   progress energy s variable rate and fixed rate debt comprised and  respectively  including the effects of interest rate derivatives 
during  cash proceeds from the sale of ncng and gas reserves were used to pay down debt  primarily commercial paper 
while this reduced the company s floating rate portion well below its long term target of  on march   the company issued commercial paper to fund a portion of the maturing million senior unsecured notes  increasing the amount of floating rate debt back to over 
progress fuels periodically enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas sales 
at december   progress fuels had approximately bcf of cash flow hedges in place for its natural gas production 
these positions extend through december genco has a floating rate credit facility that requires  as part of the loan terms  a cash flow hedge against floating interest rate exposure 
in order to satisfy this requirement  genco entered into a series of interest rate collars during with notional amounts up to a maximum of million and a final maturity date of march  contractual obligations the following table reflects progress energy s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  in the respective periods in which they are due in millions less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases fuel and purchased power      other purchase obligations north carolina clean air capital commitments funding obligations other commitments total      information on the company s contractual obligations at december  is included in the notes to the progress energy consolidated financial statements

the company s other purchase obligations are included in note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
the company s lease obligations are included in note c to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
pec s north carolina clean air legislation capital commitments are described in note e to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
in  the company expects to make million of required contributions directly to retirement plan assets 
decommissioning cost provisions are included in note d to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
in  pec must begin transitioning amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of million must be complete by december   and at least must be transitioned each year 
the company s other commitments are included in note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
the company takes into consideration the future commitments shown above when assessing its liquidity and future financing needs 
the company s maturing debt obligations are generally expected to be refinanced with new debt issuances in the capital markets 
however  the company does plan to annually reduce its leverage by one to two percentage points over the next few years through the sale of assets and excess operating cash flow 
fuel and purchased power commitments represent the majority of the company s remaining future commitments after its debt obligations 
essentially all of the company s fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through pass through clauses in accordance with north carolina  south carolina and florida regulations and therefore do not require separate liquidity support 
other matters current regulatory environment general the company s electric utility operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the electric businesses are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
in addition  the company is subject to sec regulation as a registered holding company under puhca 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the electric utilities are permitted to earn  are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
electric industry restructuring pec and pef continue to monitor any developments toward a more competitive environment and have actively participated in regulatory reform deliberations in north carolina  south carolina and florida 
movement toward deregulation in these states has been affected by recent developments  including developments related to deregulation of the electric industry in other states 
the company expects the legislatures in all three states will continue to monitor the experiences of states that have implemented electric restructuring legislation 
the company cannot anticipate when  or if  any of these states will move to increase competition in the electric industry 
florida retail rate proceeding in march  the parties in pef s rate case entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement the agreement related to retail rate matters 
the agreement was approved by the fpsc and is generally effective from may  through december   provided  however  that if pef s base rate earnings fall below a return on equity  pef may petition the fpsc to amend its base rates 
see note d to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for additional information on the agreement 
north carolina clean air legislation in june  legislation was enacted in north carolina requiring the state s electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from coal fired power plants 
progress energy expects its capital costs to meet these emission targets to be approximately million by  of which approximately million has been expended through december  pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation in north carolina that is affected by this legislation 
the legislation requires the emissions reductions to be completed in phases by  and applies to each utility s total system rather than setting requirements for individual power plants 
the legislation also freezes the utilities base rates for five years unless there are significant cost changes due to governmental action or other extraordinary events beyond the control of the utilities or unless the utilities persistently earn a return substantially in excess of the rate of return established and found reasonable by the ncuc in the utilities last general rate case 
further  the legislation allows the utilities to recover from their retail customers the projected capital costs during the first seven years of the year compliance period beginning on january  the utilities must recover at least of their projected capital costs during the five year rate freeze period 
pursuant to the law  pec entered into an agreement with the state of north carolina to transfer to the state all future emissions allowances it generates from over complying with the federal emission limits when these units are completed 
the law also requires the state to undertake a study of mercury and carbon dioxide emissions in north carolina 
operation and maintenance costs will increase due to the additional personnel  materials and general maintenance associated with the equipment 
operation and maintenance expenses are recoverable through base rates  rather than as part of this program 
progress energy cannot predict the future regulatory interpretation  implementation or impact of this law 
florida proposed clean air legislation in  a bill was introduced in the florida legislature that would require significant reductions in so  nox and particulate emissions from certain coal  natural gas and oil fired generating units owned or operated by investor owned electric utilities  including pef 
the so and nox reductions would be effective beginning with calendar year and the particulate reductions would be effective beginning with calendar year under the proposed legislation  the fpsc would be authorized to allow the utilities to recover the costs of compliance with the emission reductions over a period not greater than seven years beginning in  but the utilities rates would be frozen at levels for at least five years of the maximum recovery period 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
other retail rate matters see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s other retail rate matters 
regional transmission organizations and standard market design in  the ferc issued order regarding rtos 
this order set minimum characteristics and functions that rtos must meet  including independent transmission service 
in july  the ferc issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in docket no 
rm  remedying undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design smd nopr 
if adopted as proposed  the rules set forth in the smd nopr would materially alter the manner in which transmission and generation services are provided and paid for 
pec and pef  as subsidiaries of progress energy  filed comments in november and supplemental comments in january in april  the ferc released a white paper on the wholesale market platform 
the white paper provides an overview of what the ferc currently intends to include in a final rule in the smd nopr docket 
the white paper retains the fundamental and most protested aspects of smd nopr  including mandatory rtos and the ferc s assertion of jurisdiction over certain aspects of retail service 
the ferc has not yet issued a final rule on smd nopr 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters or the effect that they may have on the gridflorida and gridsouth proceedings currently ongoing before the ferc 
it is unknown what impact the future proceedings will have on the company s earnings  revenues or prices

franchise litigation three cities  with a total of approximately  customers  have litigation pending against pef in various circuit courts in florida 
three other cities  with a total of approximately  customers  have subsequently settled their lawsuits with pef and signed new  year franchise agreements 
the lawsuits principally seek a declaratory judgment that the cities have the right to purchase pef s electric distribution system located within the municipal boundaries of the cities  a declaratory judgment that the value of the distribution system must be determined through arbitration  and injunctive relief requiring pef to continue to collect from pef s customers and remit to the cities  franchise fees during the pending litigation  and as long as pef continues to occupy the cities rights of way to provide electric service  notwithstanding the expiration of the franchise ordinances under which pef had agreed to collect such fees 
five circuit courts have entered orders requiring arbitration to establish the purchase price of pef s electric distribution system within five cities 
two appellate courts have upheld those circuit court decisions and authorized cities to determine the value of pef s electric distribution system within the cities through arbitration 
arbitration in one of the cases the city of casselberry was held in august following arbitration  the parties entered settlement discussions  and in july  the city approved a settlement agreement and a new  year franchise agreement with pef 
the settlement resolves all pending litigation with that city 
a second arbitration with the  customer city of winter park was completed in february that arbitration panel issued an award in may setting the value of pef s distribution system within the city of winter park at approximately million  not including separation and reintegration costs and construction work in progress  which could add several million dollars to the award 
the panel also awarded pef approximately million in stranded costs 
in september  winter park voters passed a referendum that would authorize the city to issue bonds of up to approximately million to acquire pef s electric distribution system 
the city has not yet definitively decided whether it will acquire the system  but has indicated that it will seek wholesale power supply bids and bids to operate and maintain the distribution system 
at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings regarding the city of winter park cannot be determined 
a third arbitration with the  customer town of belleair was completed in june in september  the arbitration panel issued an award in that case setting the value of the electric distribution system within the town at approximately million 
the panel further required the town to pay to pef its requested million in separation and reintegration costs and approximately million in stranded costs 
the town has not yet decided whether it will attempt to acquire the system 
at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings regarding the town of belleair cannot be determined 
a fourth arbitration with the  customer city of apopka had been scheduled for january in december  the apopka city commission voted on first reading to approve a settlement agreement and a year franchise with pef 
the settlement and franchise became effective upon approval by the commission at a second reading of the franchise in january the settlement resolves all outstanding litigation between the parties 
arbitration in the remaining city s litigation the  customer city of edgewood has not yet been scheduled 
as part of the above litigation  two appellate courts have also reached opposite conclusions regarding whether pef must continue to collect from its customers and remit to the cities franchise fees under the expired franchise ordinances 
pef has filed an appeal with the florida supreme court to resolve the conflict between the two appellate courts 
the florida supreme court held oral argument in one of the appeals in august subsequently  the court requested briefing from the parties in the other appeal  which was completed in november the court has not yet issued a decision in these cases 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time

synthetic fuels tax credits progress energy  through the fuels business segment  produces coal based solid synthetic fuel 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuel qualifies for tax credits under section if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the feedstock used to produce such synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility that was placed in service before july  any synthetic fuel tax credit amounts not utilized are carried forward indefinitely and are included in deferred taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
all entities have received plrs from the irs with respect to their synthetic fuel operations 
these tax credits are subject to review by the irs  and if progress energy fails to prevail through the administrative or legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section credits  with a significant impact on earnings and cash flows 
total section credits generated to date including fpc prior to its acquisition by the company are approximately  million 
the current section tax credit program expires at the end of one of the company s synthetic fuel entities  colona synfuel limited partnership  lllp colona  from which the company and fpc prior to its acquisition by the company has been allocated approximately million in tax credits to date  is being audited by the irs 
the company is audited regularly in the normal course of business  as are most similarly situated companies  and the audit of colona was expected 
in september  all of progress energy s majority owned synthetic fuel entities  including colona  were accepted into the irs pre filing agreement pfa program 
the pfa program allows taxpayers to voluntarily accelerate the irs exam process in order to seek resolution of specific issues 
either the company or the irs can withdraw from the program at any time  and issues not resolved through the program may proceed to the next level of the irs exam process 
in june  the company was informed that irs field auditors had raised questions regarding the chemical change associated with coal based synthetic fuel manufactured at its colona facility and the testing process by which the chemical change is verified 
the questions arose in connection with the company s participation in the pfa program 
the chemical change and the associated testing process were described as part of the plr request for colona 
based on that application  the irs ruled in colona s plr that the synthetic fuel produced at colona undergoes a significant chemical change and thus qualifies for tax credits under section in october  the national office of the irs informed the company that it had rejected the irs field auditors challenges regarding whether the synthetic fuel produced at the company s colona facility was the result of a significant chemical change 
the national office had concluded that the experts  engaged by colona who test the synthetic fuel for chemical change  use reasonable scientific methods to reach their conclusions 
accordingly  the national office will not take any adverse action on the plr that has been issued for the colona facility 
although this ruling applies only to the colona facility  the company believes that the national office s reasoning would be equally applicable to the other progress energy facilities 
the company applies essentially the same chemical process and uses the same independent laboratories to confirm chemical change in the synthetic fuel manufactured at each of its other facilities 
in february  subsidiaries of the company finalized execution of the colona closing agreement with the irs concerning their colona synthetic fuel facilities 
the colona closing agreement provided that the colona facilities were placed in service before july   which is one of the qualification requirements for tax credits under section the colona closing agreement further provides that the fuel produced by the colona facilities in is a qualified fuel for purposes of the section tax credits 
this action concludes the irs pfa program with respect to colona 
although the execution of the colona closing agreement is a significant event  the audits of the company s facilities are not yet completed and the pfa process continues with respect to the four synthetic fuel facilities owned by other affiliates of progress energy and fpc 
currently  the focus of that process is to determine that the facilities were placed in service before july  in management s opinion  progress energy is complying with all the necessary requirements to be allowed such credits under section  although it cannot provide certainty  that it will prevail if challenged by the irs on credits taken 
accordingly  the company has no current plans to alter its synthetic fuel production schedule as a result of these matters 
in october  the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations began a general investigation concerning synthetic fuel tax credits claimed under section the investigation is examining the utilization of the credits  the nature of the technologies and fuels created  the use of the synthetic fuel  and other aspects of section and is not specific to the company s synthetic fuel operations 
progress energy is providing information in connection with this investigation 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in addition  the company has retained an advisor to assist in selling an interest in one or more synthetic fuel entities 
the company is pursuing the sale of a portion of its synthetic fuel production capacity that is underutilized due to limits on the amount of credits that can be generated and utilized by the company 
the company would expect to retain an ownership interest and to operate any sold facility for a management fee 
the final outcome and timing of these discussions is uncertain and the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local regulations addressing air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste management and other environmental matters 
these environmental matters are discussed in detail in note e to the progress energy consolidated financial statements and note d to the progress energy carolinas consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk progress energy  inc 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
certain market risks are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt and commercial paper  and fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
the company manages its market risk in accordance with its established risk management policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with the company s operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
variable rate debt has rates that adjust in periods ranging from daily to monthly 
interest rate derivative instruments may be used to adjust interest rate exposures and to protect against adverse movements in rates 
the following tables provide information at december  and  about the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and fpc obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps and the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts 
see interest rate derivatives under liquidity and capital resources above for more information on interest rate derivatives

marketable securities price risk the company s electric utility subsidiaries maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of these funds was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company actively monitors its portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the company s regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect the earnings of the company 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of fpc  the company issued million contingent value obligations cvos 
each cvo represents the right to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuel facilities purchased by subsidiaries of fpc in october the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
these cvos are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december  and  the fair value of these cvos was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in the december  market price would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the cvos 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
the company s exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of pec and pef 
in addition  many of the company s long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel responsibility to the purchaser 
the company uses natural gas hedging instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the future sales price of the company s natural gas 
in addition  the company may engage in limited economic hedging and trading activity using natural gas and electricity financial instruments
