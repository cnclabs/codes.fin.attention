item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  neither the pre tax nor after tax sec pv value amounts shown above should be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease or increase in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in production prices 
acreage the following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped acreage at december  the acreage is located in the eastern and gulf coast areas of the united states 
gross acreage net acreage in thousands developed undeveloped total wells drilled the following table sets forth the gross and net number of exploratory and development wells drilled during the last three years 
the number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells spud at any time during the respective year 
net wells equal the number of gross wells multiplied by our working interest in each of the gross wells 
productive wells represent either wells which were producing or which were capable of commercial production 
gross net gross net gross net development productive non productive exploratory productive non productive under evaluation total the ten exploratory wells under evaluation represent coalbed methane cbm wells drilled and completed in the cherokee basin in chase county  kansas 
the company expects to determine the commercial viability of the cherokee basin program during the first half of productive wells the number of productive oil and gas wells in which we had a working interest at december  is set forth below

information regarding coal royalty and land management properties the partnership s coal reserves at december  covered  acres  including fee and leased acreage  in virginia  west virginia  new mexico and eastern kentucky 
the coal reserves are in various surface and underground seams 
as of december   the partnership had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves  which are found in the following six separate properties the wise property  located in wise and lee counties  virginia and letcher and harlan counties  kentucky  the coal river property  located in boone  fayette  kanawha  lincoln and raleigh counties  west virginia  the new mexico property  located in mckinley county  new mexico  the northern appalachia property  located in barbour  harrison  lewis  monongalia and upshur counties  west virginia  the spruce laurel property  located in boone and logan counties  west virginia  and the buchanan property  located in buchanan county  virginia 
reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
proven coal reserves are reserves for which a the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  working or drill holes  grade and quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  the partnership performs additional drilling to ensure the continuity and mineablility of coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s reserves are high in energy content  low in sulfur and suitable for either the steam or metallurgical market 
the amount of coal a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs 
the following table sets forth production data and reserve information with respect to each of the partnership s six properties production year ended december proven and probable reserves at december  property under ground surface total tons in millions wise coal river new mexico northern appalachia spruce laurel buchanan total the following table sets forth the coal reserves the partnership owns and leases with respect to each of its coal properties as of december  owned property surface and mineral interests mineral interests only leased total tons in millions wise coal river new mexico northern appalachia spruce laurel buchanan total at december   the partnership s coal reserve estimates were prepared from geological data assembled and analyzed by pvr s general partner s geologists and engineers 
these estimates were compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
these estimates also take into account legal  qualitative technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined 
reserve estimates will change from time to time due to mining activities  analysis of new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings  modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors the partnership s timber assets consist of various hardwoods  primarily red oak  white oak  yellow poplar and black cherry 
at december   the partnership owned an estimated mmbf of standing saw timber

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of financial condition and results of operations of penn virginia corporation and subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview penn virginia corporation penn virginia or the company is an independent energy company that is engaged in two primary business segments 
our oil and gas segment explores for  develops  produces and sells crude oil  condensate and natural gas primarily in the eastern and gulf coast onshore areas of the united states 
our coal royalty and land management segment operates through our percent ownership in penn virginia resource partners  lp the partnership or pvr 
penn virginia and pvr are both publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbols pva and pvr  respectively 
due to our control of the general partner of pvr  the financial results of the partnership are included in our consolidated financial statements 
however  pvr functions with a capital structure that is independent of the company  consisting of its own debt instruments and publicly traded common units 
the following diagram depicts our ownership of pvr logo as a result of our ownership in the partnership  we receive cash payments from pvr in the form of quarterly cash distributions 
we received approximately million of cash distributions from pvr during as part of our ownership of pvr s general partner  we also own the rights  referred to as incentive distribution rights  to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after certain levels of cash distributions have been achieved 
see item business corporate and other for more information on incentive distribution rights 
as of december   pvr had not achieved a level of distribution to allow us to receive an increased percentage of available cash 
we are committed to increasing value to our shareholders by conducting a balanced program of investment in our two business segments 
in the oil and gas segment  we expect to execute a program combining relatively low risk  moderate return development drilling in the appalachian region of virginia and west virginia with higher risk  higher return exploration and development drilling in the onshore gulf coast  supplemented periodically with acquisitions 
in addition to our continuing conventional development program  we are expanding our eastern presence by developing coalbed methane cbm gas reserves in appalachia 
by employing horizontal drilling techniques  we expect to increase the value from the cbm reserves we own 
we are also committed to expanding our onshore gulf coast oil and gas reserves and production internally through our exploratory and development drilling programs and by acquiring reserves with favorable returns 
in the coal royalty and land management segment  pvr continually evaluates acquisition opportunities that could increase to cash available for distribution to pvr unit holders  of which we are the largest single unitholder 
these opportunities include  but are not limited to  acquiring additional coal properties and reserves  acquiring or constructing assets for coal services which would provide a fee based revenue stream and acquiring mid stream hydrocarbon related transportation assets and other operating units that would strategically fit within the partnership 
our oil and gas capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
borrowings against our credit facility were million out of million available as of december   and we expect to fund our capital expenditures with a combination of internal cash flow and credit facility borrowings 
coal related capital expenditures on existing properties in are expected to be less than million 
as of december   pvr had borrowed million against its debt facilities 
cash flow from operations  supplemented with credit facility borrowings  is expected to be adequate for pvr to fund capital expenditures and distributions to unitholders 
performance oil and gas segment in  we increased our oil and gas production to bcfe  a percent increase over bcfe produced in this increase resulted from a january acquisition in south texas  the company s horizontal cbm drilling program in central appalachia and additional drilling of the selma chalk wells in mississippi 
these increases were offset in part by natural field declines 
average daily oil and gas production increased to mmcfe in the fourth quarter of compared to mmcfe in the fourth quarter of commodity prices  in particular for natural gas  were the largest single factor affecting our financial results in price volatility in the natural gas market has been high in the last few years 
throughout and  the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices 
our realized natural gas price in was per mcf  net of per mcf hedging loss 
we use financial instruments to hedge natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil prices 
the use of financial hedging instruments is an integral part of our risk management strategy  but in we realized a lower price per mcf as a result of hedging 
our total oil and gas reserves at the end of were bcfe  an increase of percent over approximately percent of our reserves at year end were natural gas 
we replaced percent of our production during at a reserve replacement cost of per mcfe 
we drilled a total of gross net wells during  including gross net development wells with a percent success rate  and gross net exploratory wells with a success rate of percent 
during  we continued to expand our cbm production and reserve base in central appalachia through acquisitions and the use of a proprietary horizontal drilling technology owned by cdx gas  llc cdx 
under our agreement with cdx  we have the right to use the technology to drill cbm wells in a  square mile area of mutual interest ami covering virtually all of central appalachia 
we acquired over  acres during and now own over  acres of cbm prospective leasehold within the ami 
by greatly accelerating production from these heretofore long lived reserves  we believe that this drilling technique should result in superior rates of return  with very low geological risk 
this technique was used to drill and complete gross net horizontal cbm wells during  more than doubling our horizontal cbm production to bcfe from bcfe in in  our capital budget includes million to continue to develop horizontal cbm reserves in central appalachia and to build additional pipeline infrastructure to transport the additional production  which is expected to become an increasingly significant part of our production base 
we are also conducting a conventional cbm pilot project in the cherokee basin of southeastern kansas  where we control over  acres of potentially prospective cbm property  and we expect to know by mid whether this project is commercially viable 
we continued to employ a low risk development strategy in our other core areas during in appalachia  we drilled gross net conventional wells 
in mississippi  we drilled gross net wells and acquired new selma chalk acreage to complement existing positions  adding to this area two to three more years of potential low risk drilling locations 
our budget includes approximately million to drill gross net development wells in appalachia and mississippi 
in early  we also acquired a combination of proved producing and proved undeveloped reserves in kingsville  a south texas field 
we participated in the drilling of wells to partially develop the field 
in december  we entered into a joint venture giving us access to a potentially large number of low risk  long lived development drilling locations in over  acres in the cotton valley play of east texas 
we are also active on the louisiana side of the cotton valley play 
we expect to spend approximately million to drill and operate as many as gross net wells in the east texas north louisiana corridor during to balance the low risk portion of our portfolio with a number of higher risk  potentially higher reward projects  we expanded our drilling efforts along the gulf coast during we drilled a successful field extension well in the broussard field in south louisiana 
we also drilled seven gross net exploratory wells in the gulf coast region  including five gross net successful exploratory wells in as many attempts in the stella and south creole fields in south louisiana 
including follow up development drilling  as of mid january  these fields were contributing over eight mmcfe  or more than ten percent of our total daily production 
approximately million has been budgeted in to drill gross net exploratory wells 
we expect to drill a total of eight gross four net wells in our higher risk  higher impact esperanza and kingsville prospects in south texas and our bayou sale prospect in south louisiana 
lower and moderate risk projects comprise the remainder of the exploratory drilling budget and include new prospects in the south creole  stella and fannett areas along the gulf coast  a southeastern louisiana miocene play and a new cbm prospect in northern west virginia 
the ability to internally generate exploration and development prospects is important to our approach in maximizing value 
toward that goal  we continued to hire technically proficient professionals and to acquire seismic data and leaseholds during we have assembled a high quality staff of both internal and consulting explorationists  and late in  we acquired access to  square miles of high quality d seismic data along the onshore gulf coast areas of texas and louisiana  which will more than double our seismic data inventory over the next year 
to support this effort  approximately percent of our capital budget has been allocated to the acquisition of seismic data and new leaseholds 
performance coal royalty and land management segment pvr in  coal royalty revenues increased percent to million from million in this increase was driven by an percent increase in coal production from pvr properties to million tons in from million tons in this production increase was primarily due to the late acquisition of million tons of coal reserves from peabody energy corporation the peabody acquisition  production from the peabody acquisition related properties contributed million tons in the average royalty rate received for coal produced from these properties during was per ton 
excluding the property acquired from peabody  production in west virginia increased percent due to the start up of new mining operations on pvr s coal river property  including sub leased operations on which pvr receives a relatively smaller margin per ton of coal mined 
tonnage mined from pvr s virginia properties was up approximately three percent in from coal prices  especially in central appalachia where the majority of pvr s production is located  have increased significantly since the beginning of the price increase stems from several causes including increased electricity demand and decreasing coal production in central appalachia 
in may  pvr agreed to a new lease on its west coal river property formerly known as fork creek with an established operator  who has over years of experience as a successful miner in appalachia 
production from the idled property commenced in july and is expected to increase over the next couple of years 
pvr also collects fees and railroad rebates related to its ownership of the coal preparation plant and coal loading facility on the west coal river property 
this new facility and several smaller modular coal preparation plants are resulting in additional coal services revenues  supplementing revenues from the shober loading facility in virginia 
pvr also spent approximately million to construct a third large scale coal loading facility on its coal river property  which began operating in february coal services revenues increased to million in from million in  and are expected to increase further in pvr believes that these types of fee based infrastructure assets provide exceptional investment and cash flow opportunities to the partnership  and it continues to look for additional investments of this type and in other qualified  primarily fee based assets  including oil and gas midstream assets 
as part of its coal land management business  pvr owns approximately million board feet of standing timber 
the partnership typically sells cutting rights to various contractors who cut in advance of a mining project 
timber revenues in were million  down from million in critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap requires the management of the company to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
we consider the following to be the most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment of our management 
reserves 
the estimates of oil and gas reserves are probably the single most critical estimate included in our financial statements 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities including projecting the total quantities in place  future production rates and the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are less precise than those of producing properties due to the lack of a production history 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves are those quantities that require additional capital investment through drilling or well recompletion techniques 
reserve estimates become the basis for determining depletive write off rates  recoverability of historical cost investments  and the fair value of properties subject to potential impairments 
there are several factors which could change our estimates of oil and gas reserves 
significantly higher or lower product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits 
an additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different than those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond our control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
additionally  we perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
when significant events occur  such as a market move to a lower price environment or a material revision to our reserve estimates 
we have recognized non cash pretax charges of million  million and million for  and  respectively  related to the impairment of oil and gas properties 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas sales revenues are recognized when crude oil and natural gas volumes are produced and sold for our account 
as a result of the numerous requirements necessary to gather information from purchasers or various measurement locations  calculate volumes produced  perform field and wellhead allocations and distribute and disburse funds to various working interest partners and royalty owners  the collection of revenues from oil and gas production may take up to days following the month of production 
therefore  accruals for revenues and accounts receivable are made based on estimates of our share of production  particularly from properties that are operated by our partners 
since the settlement process may take to days following the month of actual production  our financial results will include estimates of production and revenues for the related time period 
any differences between the actual amounts ultimately received and the original estimates are recorded in the period they become finalized 
coal royalties 
coal royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of coal sold by the partnership s lessees and the corresponding revenues from those sales 
since pvr is not the mine operator  it does not have the actual production and revenues amounts until approximately days following the month of production 
therefore  the financial results of the partnership will include estimated revenues and accounts receivable for this day period 
any differences between the actual amounts ultimately received and the original estimates are recorded in the period they become finalized 
oil and gas properties 
we use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration costs  geological  geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
a portion of the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately million 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration work is unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to the unsuccessful work will be expensed 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
asset retirement obligations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we make estimates of the timing and future costs of plugging and abandoning wells 
estimated abandonment dates will be revised in the future based on changes to related economic lives  which vary with product prices and production costs 
estimated plugging costs may also be adjusted to reflect changing industry experience 
increases in operating costs and decreases in product prices would increase the estimated amount of our plugging and abandonment obligations and increase depletion expense 
our cash flows would not be affected until costs to plug and abandon were actually incurred 
acquisitions oil and gas on january   we acquired a percent non operating working interest in properties located in a producing field in south texas the south texas acquisition 
the properties were acquired in a cash transaction with a private investor group for million 
the acquisition  which was effective december   was financed with the company s existing credit facility 
nine producing wells were acquired at the time of the acquisition 
ten successful development wells and one development dry hole have been drilled in the field since the acquisition date 
additional wells are expected to be drilled over the next few years to fully develop the field 
coal royalty and land management in pvr s december peabody acquisition  the partnership acquired two properties containing approximately million tons of coal reserves from peabody for  million common units   million class b common units a combined common unit value of million and million in cash 
the acquisition included approximately million  or  class b units  held in escrow pending certain title transfers at december  as a result of the units held in escrow  approximately five million tons of coal reserves and  common units were not included in property  plant and equipment or partners capital  respectively  at december  in july   class b common units were released from escrow in exchange for certain title transfers in new mexico 
in july  all of the class b common units were converted to common units  in accordance with their terms  upon the approval of our common unitholders 
as of december    common units remained in escrow pending peabody acquiring and transferring to us certain of the west virginia reserves we purchased 
as a result of the units held in escrow  approximately one million tons of coal reserves and  common units were not included in property  plant and equipment or partners capital  respectively  at december  approximately two thirds of the reserves purchased from peabody are located on the lee ranch property in new mexico  which peabody continues to operate as a surface mining operation 
the balance of the reserves is in northern west virginia  which peabody also continues to operate 
all of these reserves are being leased back to peabody for royalty rates which escalate annually over the life of the property s production 
as part of the transaction  peabody will receive the right to share in the general partner s incentive distribution rights  if any  in exchange for additional properties peabody may source to the partnership in the future 
the cash portion of the transaction was funded with long term debt and million in proceeds from the sale of us treasury notes 
the acquired coal reserves had existing productive operations that have been included in the partnership s statements of income since the closing date 
in pvr s august upshur acquisition  the partnership acquired the coal mineral interests to approximately million tons of coal reserves located on the upshur properties in northern appalachia for million in cash 
the upshur acquisition was the partnership s first exposure outside of central appalachia 
the properties  which include approximately  mineral acres  contain predominantly high sulfur  high btu coal reserves 
in may  the partnership acquired the fork creek property in west virginia  which is now referred to as the west coal river property  by purchasing approximately million tons of coal reserves for million in cash 
in early  the operator at west coal river filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
west coal river s operations were subsequently idled on march  the operator continued to pay minimum royalties to the partnership until it recovered its lease on august  in november  the partnership purchased various infrastructure at west coal river  including a ton per hour coal preparation plant and a unit train loadout facility and a railroad granted rebate on coal loaded through the facility for million  and it assumed approximately million in reclamation liabilities and approximately million of stream mitigation obligations 
the partnership leased this property in may and has assigned all reclamation and mitigation liabilities to the new lessee  which agreed to be responsible for those liabilities 
the new lessee began operations in the third quarter of results of operations selected financial data consolidated in millions  except share data revenues operating costs and expenses operating income net income earnings per share  basic earnings per share  diluted cash flows provided by operating activities included in net income for was million  or per diluted share  related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this amount is included in the oil and gas segment s contribution to net income 
the results included a pre tax gain on the sale of securities of approximately million million after tax 
this amount is included in corporate and other 
also included in the results was the impairment of certain oil and gas properties  for which we recorded a million million after tax impairment charge 
this amount was included in the oil and gas segment s contribution to net income 
consolidated net income net income for the company totaled million in  an increase of percent over the increase was driven by higher oil and gas production volumes and increased market prices for crude oil and natural gas 
oil and gas segment in our oil and gas segment  we explore for  develop and produce crude oil and natural gas in the eastern and gulf coast onshore regions of the united states 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  which are affected by numerous factors that are generally beyond the company s control 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
natural gas prices are influenced by national and regional supply and demand 
a substantial or extended decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could  under certain circumstances  result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
our future profitability and growth is also highly dependent on the results of our exploratory and development drilling programs

production volumes for the related properties sold were insignificant 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
oil and gas total revenues increased million to million in from million in crude oil and natural gas production increased to bcfe in  a percent increase over bcfe in the increase was primarily due to the south texas acquisition in january and the drilling programs in and increased oil and natural gas production accounted for approximately million  or percent  of the million increase in total oil and gas revenues from to approximately percent of our production was natural gas  for which the average natural gas price received during was per mcf compared with per mcf in  a percent increase 
the average oil price received was per barrel for  up percent from per barrel in increased oil and natural gas prices accounted for approximately million  or percent  of the million increase in total oil and gas revenues from to due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we will hedge the price received for sales volumes through the use of swaps and costless collars in accordance with our corporate policy 
gains and losses from hedging activities are included in revenues when the hedged production occurs 
we recognized a loss on settled hedging activities of million in and a loss of million in operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase related to operations associated with the south texas acquisition in january and new producing wells resulting from successful drilling activities over the last twelve months 
in addition to new operations  there were increased well workover costs associated with various fields 
exploration expenses for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in thousands seismic dry hole costs leasehold amortization other total exploration expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to unsuccessful exploratory wells and the additional purchase of seismic data to evaluate both existing and new prospects during compared to there were three unsuccessful exploratory attempts in both years  however  the location  type and depth of the wells drilled changed between years 
the unsuccessful wells in were primarily in the gulf coast region  while the unsuccessful wells in were in the appalachia region  which has smaller  less costly drilling projects than the gulf coast region 
taxes other than income taxes increased from million in to million in the increased taxes were a result of the increased revenues due to the higher prices received for natural gas and crude oil as well as increased production in as compared to oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher production  as discussed earlier  and an increase in the weighted average dd a rate from per mcfe in to per mcfe in the increase in the weighted average dd a rate was the result of a greater percentage of production coming from fields which carry higher reserve replacement cost averages 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
oil and gas total revenues increased million to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in crude oil and natural gas production  offset by a decrease in average realized prices 
crude oil and natural gas production increased to bcfe in  a percent increase over bcfe in the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of production from the gulf coast oil and gas properties acquired in july and development drilling success in connection with our gulf coast  mississippi and appalachian assets 
approximately percent of our production was natural gas 
the average natural gas price received during was per mcf compared with per mcf in  a percent decrease 
the average oil price received was per barrel for  up three percent from per barrel in due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we sometimes hedge the price received for sales volumes through the use of swaps and costless collars 
gains and losses from hedging activities are included in revenues when the hedged production occurs 
we recognized a loss on settled hedging activities of million in and a gain of million in operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the full year impact of operating costs related to our acquisition of certain gulf coast oil and gas properties in late july of exploration expenses for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in thousands seismic dry hole costs leasehold amortization other total exploration expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily due to amounts expensed for three unsuccessful exploratory wells in compared to five in  and the reduced write offs of unproved property in compared to offsetting these decreases were additional seismic expenditures of million in  up from million in taxes other than income taxes increased from million in to million in the increased taxes were a result of the higher production and revenue levels in general and administrative g a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the gulf coast oil and gas properties in july and related personnel expenses 
dd a expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher production  as discussed earlier  and an increase in the weighted average dd a rate from per mcfe in to per mcfe in the increased dd a rate resulted from revisions in reserve estimates and additional capital investment 
coal royalty and land management segment pvr the coal royalty and land management segment includes pvr s coal reserves  its timber assets and its other land assets 
the assets  liabilities and earnings of pvr are fully consolidated in our financial statements  with the public unitholders interest reflected as a minority interest 
the partnership enters into leases with various third party operators for the right to mine coal reserves on the partnership s properties in exchange for royalty payments 
approximately percent of the partnership s coal royalty revenues and percent of its coal royalty revenues were based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal sold  with pre established minimum monthly or annual payments 
the balance of the partnership s and coal royalty revenues were based on fixed royalty rates which escalate annually  also with pre established monthly minimums 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  the partnership generates coal service revenues from fees charged to lessees for the use of coal preparation and transportation facilities 
the partnership also generates revenues from the sale of timber on its properties 
the coal royalty stream is impacted by several factors  which pvr generally cannot control 
the number of tons mined annually is determined by an operator s mining efficiency  labor availability  geologic conditions  access to capital  ability to market coal and ability to arrange reliable transportation to the end user 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which may have a significant impact on the mining operations of the partnership s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require pvr  its lessees or its lessee s customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs

coal royalty revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
average gross royalties per ton decreased from in to in as a result of the lower royalty rates attributable to the peabody acquisition in december over these same periods  production increased by million tons  or percent  from million tons to millions tons 
these variances were primarily due to the following factors production increased on the new mexico property by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase was a direct result of the peabody acquisition in december production increased on the northern appalachia property by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase was a direct result of the peabody acquisition in december and the upshur acquisition in august production on the coal river property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
of these increases  million tons  or million  resulted from the addition of a mine operator and a new mine by one lessee  million tons  or million  resulted from an adjacent property lessee mining over on to pvr s property and the balance of the increase was primarily due to one lessee beginning operations in late and reaching full production in and start up operations on the west coal river property 
additional production from two lessees with high royalty rates coupled with increased demand in the region resulted in a percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton on the coal river property from per ton in to per ton in production on the wise property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
these increases were primarily due to additional mining equipment being added by two lessees and another lessee beginning operations in late and reaching full production in production on the spruce laurel property decreased by million tons  which resulted in a decrease in revenues of million 
these decreases were the result of the depletion of two mines in production on the buchanan property decreased by million tons  which resulted in a million decrease in revenues as this property continues to approach the end of its reserve life 
timber revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
volume sold declined mmbf  or percent  to mmbf in  compared to mmbf for the decrease in volume sold was due to the timing of parcel sales 
coal services revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was a direct result of our west coal river preparation and transportation facility beginning operations in july and the addition of one of pvr s three modular preparation plants 
other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to reduction of minimum rental revenues 
the decrease in minimum rental revenues was due to a lessee rejecting pvr s lease in bankruptcy in  consequently  million of deferred revenues from this respective lessee was recognized as income in additionally  a railroad rebate received for the use of a specific portion of railroad by one of pvr s lessees was paid in full in the fourth quarter of operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include both lease operating expenses and taxes other than income  increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing a percent increase 
lease operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was primarily due to maintenance costs for idled mines on the west coal river property 
pvr leased its west coal river property in may  and the on going maintenance costs were assumed by the new lessee as of that date 
the remainder of the variance is primarily attributable to increased production by lessees on subleased properties 
aggregate production from subleased properties increased to million tons for the year ended december  from million tons for the year ended december   an increase of million tons  or percent 
taxes other than income for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the variance was attributable to increased property taxes as a result of assuming the property tax obligation on the west coal river property upon re acquiring the lease from the bankrupt lessee 
the west coal river property was leased in may  and the on going property taxes were assumed by the new lessee as of that date 
g a expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing a percent increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll  an increase in insurance premiums and additional recurring expenses associated with the peabody acquisition and costs related to the secondary offering of units for peabody 
dd a expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was a result of higher depletion rates caused by higher cost bases relative to reserves added as well as increased production  both of which related primarily to the peabody and upshur acquisitions completed in the last half of interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in  an increase of million  or percent 
the higher interest expense was primarily due to the increase in pvr s long term borrowings in connection with the peabody acquisition in december interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to the liquidation of million of us treasury notes in the last half of minority interest 
minority interest was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the public s ownership percentage in the partnership  offset by a decrease in the partnership s net income for the comparable years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
coal royalty and land management segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or three percent 
coal royalty revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or three percent 
over these same periods  production decreased by million tons  or seven percent  from million tons to millions tons 
these decreases were primarily due to weaker coal demand in in general  and more specifically  the idling of production at the west coal river property caused by the lessee s bankruptcy 
timber revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or five percent 
volume sold declined mmbf  or five percent  to mmbf in  compared to mmbf for coal services revenues remained constant at million for the years ended december  and slight increases in revenues generated from pvr s modular preparation plants and dock loadout facility were offset by a minor reduction in revenues from its unit train loadout facility 
other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was primarily due to the recognition of minimum rental payments received from the partnership s lessees which are no longer recoupable by the lessee 
two of pvr s lessees  horizon resources  inc formerly aei resources  inc 
and pen holdings  inc  both of which filed chapter bankruptcies during  accounted for million of minimum rental income in operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include both lease operating expenses and taxes other than income  were million for the years ended december  and lease operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or nine percent 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in production by lessees on the partnership s subleased properties  offset by temporary mine maintenance costs on its coal river property 
aggregate production from subleased properties decreased to million tons for the year ended december  from million tons for the year ended december  taxes other than income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in state franchise taxes resulting from the partnership s change from a corporate to a partnership structure in late prior to the initial formation of the partnership  franchise taxes were calculated based on filing as a corporation 
g a expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an percent increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to a full year of fees and expenses associated with the partnership being a publicly traded entity 
dd a for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
the increase resulted from an increase in the depletive write off rate per ton caused by a downward revision of coal reserves in late  higher cost coal properties being added to the depletable base as a result of recent acquisitions and additional depreciation related to coal services capital projects 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to partnership s long term borrowings in connection with its creation in october see additional discussion of the partnership s credit facilities below in capital resources and liquidity 
interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income was due to the us treasury notes purchased by the partnership in conjunction with the closing of its initial public offering in october  and securing its own credit facility

these measures are commonly used within the industry as a measurement to determine the performance of a company s oil and gas activities 
a finding and development cost is calculated by dividing costs incurred in certain oil and gas activities exclusive of asset retirement obligation less proved property acquisitions  by reserve extensions  discoveries and other additions and revisions 
the finding and development costs used in this calculation included million for unproved property acquisition costs including the impact of deferred income taxes related to the purchase of certain gulf coast oil and gas properties in the third quarter of no proved reserves were recorded relative to these unproved property acquisition costs  for which future exploration and development activities will be conducted

in  our acquisition of gulf coast properties was funded with credit facility borrowings that were subsequently repaid with proceeds from pvr s initial public offering 
although results are consolidated for financial reporting  the change in ownership structure of pvr has resulted in the company and pvr operating with independent capital structures 
the company and pvr have separate credit facilities  and neither entity guarantees the debt of the other 
since pvr s public offering  with the exception of cash distributions received by the company from pvr  the cash needs of each entity have been met independently with a combination of operating cash flows  credit facility borrowings and  in the case of pvr s peabody acquisition  issuance of new partnership units 
we expect that our cash needs and the cash needs of pvr will continue to be met independently of each other with a combination of these funding sources

cash flows from operating activities consolidated net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with million in the oil and gas and corporate segment s net cash provided by operations was million in and million in the increase was primarily due to increased prices received for  and higher production of natural gas and crude oil 
cash in excess of working capital needs for both years was used to help fund the respective year s capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations of the coal royalty and land management segment was million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to increased production attributable to the peabody acquisition in december cash flows from investing activities consolidated net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared with million in during and  we used cash primarily for capital expenditures for oil and gas development and exploration activities and acquisitions of oil and gas properties

b amounts include million of noncash items related to equity issued in the form of pvr common units in connection with pvr s peabody acquisition 
we are committed to expanding our oil and natural gas operations over the next several years through a combination of exploration  development and acquisition of new properties 
we have a portfolio of assets which balances relatively low risk  moderate return development projects in appalachia and mississippi with relatively moderate risk  with potentially higher return development projects and exploration prospects in south texas and south louisiana 
oil and gas segment capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
approximately million of the planned oil and gas capital expenditures are expected to be for development drilling projects  including horizontal coalbed methane drilling in appalachia  exploitation of our mississippi selma chalk assets  drilling within our core assets in southern west virginia and drilling cotton valley wells in east texas and northern louisiana 
exploration drilling is expected to be approximately million of the planned expenditures  concentrated primarily in south louisiana and south texas 
expenditures to build our library of d seismic data for drilling prospect generation is expected to be approximately million  and lease acquisition and field project expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
we continually review drilling and other capital expenditure plans and may change these amounts based on industry conditions and the availability of capital 
we believe our cash flow from operations and sources of debt financing are sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures program 
cash flows from financing activities consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with million in credit facility borrowings provided approximately million of cash in and million of cash in we also received million of cash distributions in and million of cash distributions in for our ownership of pvr units 
funds from both of these sources were primarily used for capital expenditure needs 
the company has a million revolving credit facility the revolver with a syndicate of major banks led by bank one na as the administrative agent  with a final maturity of december the revolver is secured by a portion of our proved oil and gas reserves 
it has an initial commitment of million which can be expanded at our option to our current approved borrowing base of million 
the company had borrowings of million against the revolver as of december   giving us approximately million of borrowing capacity available under the revolver as of that date 
the revolver is governed by a borrowing base calculation and will be redetermined semi annually 
we have the option to elect interest at i libor plus a eurodollar margin ranging from to percent  based on the percentage of the borrowing base outstanding or ii the greater of the prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to percent 
the revolver allows for issuance of up to million of letters of credit 
at december   letters of credit issued were million 
the financial covenants require us to maintain levels of debt to earnings and dividend limitation restrictions 
we are currently in compliance with all of our covenants 
we have a million line of credit  which had no borrowings against it as of december  the line of credit is effective through june and is renewable annually 
we have an option to elect either a fixed rate libor loan  floating rate libor loan or base rate as determined by the financial institution loan 
as of december   the partnership had outstanding borrowings of million  consisting of million borrowed against a million revolving credit facility and million attributable to the partnership s senior unsecured notes million offset by million fair value of interest rate swap 
on october   the partnership entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility the pvr revolver to increase the facility from million to million and to extend the maturity date to october the revolver is with a syndicate of financial institutions led by pnc bank  national association  as its agent 
based primarily on the total debt to consolidated ebitda covenant and subsequent to the issuance of pvr senior unsecured notes  as described below  available borrowing capacity under the pvr revolver as of december  was approximately million 
the revolver is available for general partnership purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and includes a million sublimit available for working capital needs and distributions and a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
at the partnership s option  indebtedness under the pvr revolver bears interest at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus percent or the prime rate as announced by pnc bank  national association or ii the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin which ranges from percent to percent based on the partnership s ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the pvr revolver for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters 
the partnership will incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the pvr revolver at a rate per annum ranging from percent to percent based upon the ratio of the partnership s consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters 
when the pvr revolver matures in october  it will terminate and all outstanding amounts thereunder will be due and payable 
the partnership may prepay the pvr revolver at any time without penalty 
the partnership is required to reduce all working capital borrowings under the working capital sublimit under the pvr revolver to zero for a period of at least consecutive days once each calendar year 
the pvr revolver prohibits the partnership from making distributions to unitholders and distributions in excess of available cash if any potential default or event of default  as defined in the pvr revolver  occurs or would result from the distribution 
in addition  the pvr revolver contains various covenants that limit  among other things  the partnership s ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make certain loans  acquisitions and investments  make any material change to the nature of the partnership s business  acquire another company or enter into a merger or sale of assets  including the sale or transfer of interests in our subsidiaries 
at december   the partnership was in compliance with the covenants in the pvr revolver 
in march  the partnership closed a private placement of million of senior unsecured notes payable the pvr notes 
the pvr notes bear interest at a fixed rate of percent and mature over a ten year period ending in march  with semi annual interest payments through march followed by semi annual principal and interest payments beginning in september proceeds of the notes after the payment of expenses related to the offering were used to repay and retire the million pvr term loan and to repay the majority of debt outstanding on the pvr revolver 
in conjunction with the pvr notes  the partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  to hedge a portion of the fair value of the pvr notes 
this swap is designated as a fair value hedge and has been reflected as a decrease in long term debt of million as of december  under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  the counterparty pays the partnership a fixed annual rate of percent on a total notional amount of million  and the partnership pays the counterparty a variable rate equal to the floating interest rate which will be determined semi annually and will be based on the six month london interbank offering rate plus percent 
future capital needs and commitments 
in  we anticipate making total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million 
nearly all of these expenditures are expected to be made in our oil and gas segment  and are expected to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
additional funding will be provided as needed from our revolver  under which we had million of borrowing capacity as of december  in our coal royalty and land management segment  pvr anticipates making total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million for coal services related projects 
part of pvr s strategy is to make acquisitions which increase cash available for distribution to its unitholders 
pvr s ability to make these acquisitions in the future will depend in part on the availability of debt financing and on its ability to periodically use equity financing through the issuance of new units 
since completing the peabody acquisition in late  pvr s ability to incur additional debt has been restricted due to limitations in its debt instruments 
as of december   pvr had approximately million of borrowing capacity available under the pvr revolver 
this limitation may have the effect of necessitating the issuance of new units by pvr  as opposed to using debt  to fund acquisitions in the future 
our contractual cash obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years thereafter in thousands penn virginia corporation revolver pvr revolver pvr notes rental commitments total contractual cash obligations rental commitments primarily relate to equipment and building leases 
also included are pvr s rental commitments  which primarily relate to reserve based properties which are  or are intended to be  subleased by the partnership to third parties 
the obligation expires when the property has been mined to exhaustion or the lease has been canceled 
the timing of mining by third party operators is difficult to estimate due to numerous factors 
we believe the obligation after five years cannot be reasonably estimated  however  based on current knowledge  we believe pvr will incur approximately million in rental commitments in perpetuity until the reserves have been exhausted 
environmental matters our businesses are subject to various environmental hazards 
several federal  state and local laws  regulations and rules govern the environmental aspects of our businesses 
noncompliance with these laws  regulations and rules can result in substantial penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe our environmental risks are materially different from those of comparable companies nor that cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on our profitability  capital expenditures  cash flows or competitive position 
however  there is no assurance that future changes in or additions to laws  regulations or rules regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact 
we believe we are materially in compliance with environmental laws  regulations and rules 
in conjunction with the partnership s leasing of property to coal operators  environmental and reclamation liabilities are generally the responsibilities of the partnership s lessees 
lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the asset 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and recognized  and recorded an asset of million  a related liability of million and a cumulative effect on change in accounting principle on prior years of million net of taxes of million

a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas and coal industry companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property and coal property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
the emerging issues task force has added the treatment of oil and gas and coal mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how we are currently classifying these assets 
oil and gas mineral rights 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties under sfas no 
financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate line item for intangible assets 
our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with successful efforts accounting rules 
further  we do not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on our compliance with covenants under our debt agreements 
coal mineral rights 
historically  we have included both owned and leased mineral interests of pvr as a component of property and equipment on the balance sheet 
however  based on the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to the coal industry  we have begun to classify costs associated with pvr s leasing of coal reserves after june  as an intangible asset on the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized property costs 
as of december   coal mineral rights of million are included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
only require the reclassification of rights which were acquired after june  unless previously maintained records make it possible to reclassify rights acquired prior to that date 
prior to june   the partnership did not separately allocate acquisition costs between owned coal mineral interests tangible property and leased coal mineral rights intangible property  as such interests were part of the same coal seams 
accordingly  we have only classified coal mineral rights acquired after june  as an intangible asset and report them in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards on how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that we classify as liabilities the fair value of all mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that had previously been recorded as equity or elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective for all existing financial instruments beginning in the third quarter of the initial adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
the company has no outstanding guarantees as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits to enhance the disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the statement retains the disclosures required by the original sfas no 
additional disclosures have been added to those disclosures including information describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date s  plan obligations  cash flows  and components of net periodic benefit costs recognized during interim periods 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have included the required additional disclosures of the revised statement in the financial statements 
see note pension plans and other post retirement benefits 
on december   a new law was enacted which expands medicare  primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligible retirees starting in we anticipate that the benefits we pay after could be lower as a result of the new medicare provisions  however  at this time the retiree medical obligations and costs reported do not reflect any changes as a result of this legislation 
deferring the recognition of the new medicare provisions impact is permitted by fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  due to open questions about some of the new medicare provisions and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance about certain matters 
the final accounting guidance could require changes to previously reported information 
we do not believe that this regulation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of long term debt borrowed against our revolver 
the revolver matures in december and is governed by a borrowing base calculation that is re determined semi annually 
we have the option to elect interest at i libor plus a eurodollar margin ranging from to percent  based on the percentage of the borrowing base outstanding or ii the greater of the prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to percent 
as a result  our interest costs will fluctuate based on short term interest rates relating to the pva revolver 
additionally  pvr refinanced million of credit facility borrowings with ten year  senior unsecured notes payable which have a percent fixed interest rate throughout their term 
however  pvr executed an interest rate swap transaction for million to hedge a portion of the fair value of its senior unsecured notes 
the interest rate swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge 
pvr executed the transaction in a method that achieved hedge accounting in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
the debt pvr incurs in the future under its credit facility will bear variable interest at either the applicable base rate or a rate based on libor 
price risk management 
our price risk management program permits the utilization of derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  option contracts and swaps to mitigate the price risks associated with fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices as they relate to our anticipated production 
these contracts and or financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
see note hedging activities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the derivative financial instruments are placed with major financial institutions that we believe are of minimum credit risk 
the fair value of our price risk management assets are significantly affected by energy price fluctuations
