the company is one of the largest operators of senior living communities in the united states in terms of resident capacity 
the company s operating strategy is to provide quality senior living services at an affordable price to its residents  while achieving and sustaining a strong  competitive position within its chosen markets  as well as to continue to enhance the performance of its operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates

revised december consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and effective as of december   for variable interest entities that existed prior to february  the company adopted the provisions of this interpretation  as of december   and its adoption resulted in the company consolidating triad i s financial position as of december  and will result in the company consolidating triad i s results of operations beginning january  the company operates the five senior living communities and two expansions in triad i under a series of long term management agreements and accounted for triad i under the equity method of accounting prior to adopting the provisions of fasb interpretation no

the company has loan commitments to triad i for construction and pre marketing expenses  in addition to requirements to fund triad i s operating deficits through operating deficit guarantees provided for in its management agreements with triad i and other advances  totaling million and million at december  and  respectively which are eliminated upon consolidation at december  
the company evaluates the carrying value of these receivables by comparing the cash flows expected from the 
table of contents operations of triad i to the carrying value of the receivables 
these cash flow models consider lease up rates  expected operating costs  debt service requirements and various other factors 
in addition  the company entered into a support agreement with triad i during the third quarter of  whereby each of the triad entities agreed to loan excess cash flow of such triad entity to any one or more of triad i  or any of the triad entities 
the carrying value of the notes receivable from triad i could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including triad i experiencing slower than expected lease up  lower than expected lease rates  higher than expected operating costs  increases in interest rates  issues involving debt service requirements  general adverse market conditions  other economic factors and changes in accounting guidelines 
management believes that the carrying value of the notes receivable is fully recoverable  based on the support agreement  factors within its control and the future achievement of the assumptions used in these cash flow models  which are consistent with the company s operating experience 
assets held for sale the company determines the fair value  net of costs of disposal  of an asset on the date the asset is categorized as held for sale  and the asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value on that date 
the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company currently has five parcels of land held for sale 
the fair value of these properties is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of these assets could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are to years for buildings and building improvements  years for land improvements and to years for furniture  equipment and automobiles 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed 
the company considers external factors relating to each asset  including contract changes  local market developments  and other publicly available information 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company does not believe there are any indicators that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of december  and results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected historical consolidated statements of income data in thousands of dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues

as a result  during inflationary periods  the company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures

as of december   the company had million in outstanding debt comprised of various fixed and variable rate debt instruments of million and million  respectively 
changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on the company s earnings or cash flows 
fluctuations in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to either libor or the prime rate  would affect the company s earnings and cash flows but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt
