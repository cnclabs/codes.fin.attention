item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january   when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january   when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january  and all amounts are in thousands  except share and per share amounts 
business overview our core business focus is to design  develop and market performance oriented athletic footwear and athletic apparel  which we sell under the saucony brand name  and athletic apparel  which we sell under the hind brand name 
sales of saucony brand products accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the significant majority of which are sales of saucony footwear products 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are heavily dependent upon our saucony footwear business 
our ability to increase saucony footwear sales is dependent in significant part upon increasing our share of the market for athletic footwear sales 
we pursue different strategies for our two saucony footwear product categories 
for our technical footwear category  we combine high quality materials and components with technical features designed to meet the performance requirements of athletes who have a high participation rate in their choice of sport 
we incorporate either our ground reaction inertia device  or grid system  or our proprietary footwear technology  custom ride management  into a majority of our technical footwear products 
for our originals footwear category  we design fashion oriented footwear intended to appeal to younger consumers who generally do not wear the footwear for athletic purposes 
our primary footwear focus is in technical footwear 
as a result  we direct most of our design and development efforts and working capital investments towards our saucony technical footwear 
we view our originals footwear as a market opportunity which we must carefully manage due to rapid shifts in consumer preferences 
accordingly  we limit our investment in working capital for  and our spending on marketing  design and development of  our originals footwear 
our saucony technical footwear and originals footwear  along with athletic apparel we sell under the saucony brand name  constitute one operating segment 
we have another operating segment which consists of athletic apparel we sell under the hind brand name  shoes for coaches and officials  football and soccer cleats and casual leather walking and workplace footwear we sell under the spot bilt brand name and sales of all of our and third parties products at our factory outlet stores 
we refer to this segment as our other products segment 
sales from our other products segment accounted for approximately our consolidated net sales for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal a majority of these sales are sales of our hind athletic apparel 
we compete in intensely competitive markets 
our ability to achieve sales growth is dependent upon several factors including  product design and technical performance  product quality  price  styling and our ability to market and promote our brand and our products 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic patterns  such as employment levels and consumer confidence 
continued economic uncertainty and decreased consumer confidence may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our sales and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when title passes and all the rewards and risk of loss have been transferred and all the criteria for revenue recognition described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b are met 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer 
we record retail store revenues at the time of sale 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we must make estimates for defective product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
we record a provision for defective product returns and other allowances based upon past experience and the receipt of notification of pending returns 
while the returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  the product return rate may not remain constant 
any significant increase in the product return rate would require that we increase our reserves 
this would reduce our net sales and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows for the period in which the returns materialize 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we established  we would record a reduction or increase to our reserves in the period in which such determination was made 
accounts receivable allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore must estimate losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt trends  customer creditworthiness  economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as noted in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we have a credit risk concentration due to the concentration of our domestic saucony footwear sales among a relatively small customer base 
if the liquidity or financial condition of any of our larger customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments due us  or if payment schedules of our customers are otherwise delayed from historical trends  we would be required to record additional allowances to our provision for doubtful accounts 
this would increase our general and administrative expenses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or the current estimated market value 
we calculate the provision for excess and obsolete inventory as the difference between the cost of the inventory and our estimated market value of the inventory 
we estimate market value based upon estimated product demand and market conditions 
we record the provision as a charge to cost of sales 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  the estimated market value of our inventory would decrease and additional provisions to write down inventory may be required 
this could materially reduce our amount of current assets and increase our cost of goods sold and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment  including buildings  leasehold improvements  equipment and computer equipment at cost and depreciate it over the applicable estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances or changes to our business operations  can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be decreased  we would increase depreciation over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
decreasing an assets estimated useful life would increase general and administrative expenses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets property  plant and equipment and trademarks when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment of a long lived asset if the carrying value of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
we measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its estimated fair value 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of and  respectively  to reduce the carrying amount of long lived assets used in our retail operations  which carrying value we deemed to be not recoverable from its future cash flows 
the charge is included in general and administrative expenses 
should future events and circumstances cause cash flows associated with any of our long lived assets to decline significantly from our estimates  we may need to record charges for impairment of long lived assets  which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
rather  we review them for impairment 
we would record an impairment if the carrying value of the asset exceeds our estimate of its fair market value 
we record impairment charges as a component of general and administrative expenses 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually 
we completed an annual test for impairment at january  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
at january   the carrying value of goodwill was our estimates of future cash flows may differ materially from actual cash flows due to  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
a charge for impairment of goodwill may be necessary if we experience a significant decline in our future cash flows 
such a charge would affect our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions that we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish valuation allowances when we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from operating losses will not be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
during fiscal  we reversed of deferred tax valuation allowances on loss carryforwards that we expect to realize  decreasing our tax expense in the period we made that reversal 
at january   we have provided valuation allowances in an amount equal to our long term deferred tax assets which have resulted from net operating losses in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions 
us generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to defer the recognition of tax liability on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operation 
at january   we had approximately  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations for which we have not recorded deferred income taxes 
were we to repatriate foreign earnings which have been designated as indefinitely invested in foreign operations  we would record additional tax expense at the time of repatriation 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to measure stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  we measure compensation cost for stock options and restricted stock awards as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we calculate compensation cost for common stock purchase warrants based upon the fair value at the grant date 
we amortize stock based compensation arising from the issuance of restricted stock warrants  below market options and stock based compensation resulting from common stock purchase warrants over the vesting period of the stock grant  option term or the warrant term 
amortization of stock based compensation amounted to for  for and for  respectively 
in fiscal  we accelerated the vesting of the common stock purchase warrants which required us to record of stock based compensation expense 
had we determined the stock based compensation expense for our stock options based upon the fair value at the grant date for stock option awards our reported net income would have been reduced by  in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal hedge accounting for derivatives we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as the resulting intercompany liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
these contracts economically function as effective hedges of the underlying exposures  however  we are required to record changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts against earnings in the period of the change 
we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts based on foreign exchange rates as of january  at january   the notional value our foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase us dollars was  the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts at january  was  we recorded a charge of against earnings to adjust our derivatives to their fair value 
since january   the value of the us dollar has decreased against the pound sterling and has strengthened against the canadian dollar and the euro 
if the us dollar were to weaken in comparison to the pound sterling  the canadian dollar or the euro  we would record additional charges in fiscal to adjust our derivatives to their fair value 
the amount of the potential charge is dependent upon the change in foreign exchange rates from the january  rates to the time that the forward exchange contract matures or to the foreign exchange rates as of the period end reporting date 
these charges could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows

net income for fiscal was  or per class a share and per class b share on a diluted basis  compared to a net loss of  or per class a share and per class b share on a diluted basis  in fiscal we used weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents of  to calculate diluted earnings per share for fiscal we used weighted average common shares of  to calculate diluted earnings per share for fiscal common stock equivalents were not used in fiscal to calculate diluted earnings per share because they were anti dilutive 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from january  the increase was due primarily to the generation of  of cash from operations and  to a lesser extent  the receipt of from the sale of our former manufacturing facility in bangor  maine  the receipt of from the issuance of shares of our common stock as a result of option exercises  partially offset by the purchase of  of short term investments  cash outlays for purchases of capital assets of  the purchase of additional common shares of saucony canada  inc of  the payment of cash dividends of on our common stock and the repurchase of shares of our common stock of our accounts receivable at january  increased  net of the provision for bad debts and discounts which was reduced by due to a litigation settlement  as compared to at january   due primarily to increased net sales of our saucony products in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable

fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from january  the increase was due primarily to the generation of  of cash from operations and  to a lesser extent  the receipt of payment on notes receivable of  the receipt of from the issuance of shares of our common stock  the conversion of in marketable securities to cash and the receipt of from the sale of capital assets  partially offset by cash outlays for the repurchase of shares of our common stock of  purchases of capital assets of  the repayment of long term debt of and debt financing costs of our accounts receivable at january  increased to  net of the provision for bad debts and discounts  as compared to at january  due primarily to increased net sales of our saucony products in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable 
our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable increased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal the provision for bad debts and doubtful accounts decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal and a change in pricing programs for several of our larger customers to net pricing  which reduced discounts in fiscal inventories decreased  at january   as compared to at january   due primarily to improvements in our supply chain which we intended to reduce on hand inventory and our decision to reduce inventory of our hind brand apparel and spot bilt footwear products 
our inventory turns ratio increased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal principal factors  other than net income  accounts receivable  provision for bad debts and discounts and inventory  affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal  included an increase of  in accounts payable due to extended payment terms provided by our footwear suppliers  a  increase in accrued income taxes payable due to higher pre tax profits and the timing of tax payments and a  increase in accrued expenses due primarily to increased accruals for incentive compensation 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for a total expenditure of credit facility in august  we entered into a revolving credit agreement under the terms of which a bank committed up to a maximum of  to us for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
the credit facility terminates on august  maximum borrowings under the credit facility are limited to the lesser of  or the sum of of eligible receivables plus of eligible finished goods inventory 
borrowings under the credit facility are made at our election at the bank s prime rate of interest less or at the libor rate plus 
in addition  we pay a quarterly commitment fee of on the average daily unused credit line 
the credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness  restrictions on the annual amount of equipment financing and capital lease indebtedness and limits on repurchases of our common stock 
as amended in january  the credit facility permits us to pay cash dividends  and make repurchases or redemptions of  or other specified distributions with respect to  our capital stock  in a total amount of up to  in any fiscal year 
furthermore  for any fiscal quarter during the term of the credit facility  any consolidated pre tax loss may not exceed  and for any two consecutive fiscal quarters  consolidated pre tax loss may not exceed  we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility at january  as of january  we had open commitments under letters of credit of and as of march  we had open commitments under letters of credit of as of january    and as of march    was available for borrowing under the credit facility 
one of our foreign subsidiaries maintains a credit facility for cash borrowings and letters of credit in the amount of  at january  and march    was available for borrowing under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k 
capital expenditures we anticipate capital expenditures to range between  to  in fiscal of this amount  we expect to expend approximately  to  to expand and renovate our peabody  massachusetts facility   to  on computer hardware and software and to to open two factory outlet stores 
contractual obligations below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commitments at january  payments due by period less one three more contractual than one to three to five than obligations total year years years five years operating leases     other long term obligations   purchase obligations   total contractual obligations     other long term obligations include athlete and event sponsorship and employment contracts with two key executives 
the amounts included for athlete sponsorship represent base compensation consist of for less than one year and for one to three years 
actual payments may be higher than the amounts included as these contracts provide for bonus payments to the athletes based upon athletic achievements in future periods 
maximum aggregate bonus payments to athletes are as follows less than one year  and one to three years  purchase order obligations consist of open purchase orders for sourced footwear and apparel and open purchase orders for us operating expenses ordered in the normal course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements we had letters of credit outstanding of at january  and at january  all of the letters of credit were issued for the purchase of inventory 
we had forward foreign exchange contracts of  at january  and  at january   all of which are due to settle within the next months see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this annual report form k 
amounts committed january  letters of credit forward foreign exchange contracts  total  we use letters of credit to facilitate a limited number of supplier arrangements for our hind apparel inventory 
we do not believe our use of letters of credit materially affects our liquidity 
if we did not use letters of credit we would make alternative arrangements with these hind apparel inventory suppliers 
our primary market risk is the risk of exposure to unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm and anticipated purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
the purpose of our currency hedging activities is to protect our local subsidiaries cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the loss of which would expose us to increased market risk and fluctuations in our liquidity 
overall liquidity our liquidity is contingent upon a number of factors  principally our future operating results 
our liquidity fluctuates during the course of a fiscal year 
for instance  we generally use cash from operations in the first quarter  due to working capital requirements  but generate cash from operations for the balance of the fiscal year 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements and other operating expenses and to fund our capital investment needs and dividend payments for at least the next months in the near term 
during fiscal we generated  in cash from operating cash flows due to our operating profit  a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable 
in  we generated  in cash from operating cash flows  due primarily to our operating profit  an increase in our accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
as of january   we had  in cash   in short term investments   in accounts receivable and  in inventories 
as approved by our board of directors on february   we paid a special  cash dividend of per share on each of our class a common stock and class b common stock on march  the aggregate dividend payout for the special dividend amounted to approximately  we paid the dividend from available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding and  available under our credit facilities 
as of march   we had no borrowings outstanding and  available under our credit facilities 
our short term liquidity could potentially be adversely impacted should demand for our products decline significantly  which could result in extended payment terms for our customers and the increased use of price concessions to induce customers to purchase our products 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on our results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuations on our purchase of inventory from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
we are  however  subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated payables 
during fiscal the gross margins of our european and canadian subsidiaries increased due to currency fluctuation 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize various transaction currency risks 
we believe that our forward foreign currency contracts function as economic hedges of our cash flows and that our foreign exchange management program effectively minimizes various transaction currency risks

special note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language elsewhere in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements 
certain factors that may affect future results we face intense competition competition is intense in the markets in which we sell our products 
we compete with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which are large organizations with diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than ours 
the principal competitors for our saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors of our hind products are nike  pearl izumi and sugoi 
we compete based on a variety of factors  including price  product style  durability and quality  product design and technical performance  brand image and awareness  marketing and promotion and the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a technological breakthrough or marketing or promotional success by one of our competitors could adversely affect our competitive position and harm our business 
we depend on foreign suppliers a number of manufacturers located in asia  primarily in china  supply products to us 
during fiscal  one of our suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of our total footwear purchases by dollar volume 
we are subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  import quotas  administrative trade cases  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability  as well as potential disruptions in our supply chain due to transportation  geographic and other factors 
there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our foreign suppliers and compete with other athletic shoe and apparel companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
we need to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and merchandise trends the footwear and apparel industries are subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
demand for our products  particularly our originals line has been and may continue to be affected adversely by changing fashion trends and consumer style preferences 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
in addition  our decisions concerning new product designs often need to be made several months before we can determine consumer acceptance 
as a result  our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or features could lead to problems such as excess inventories and higher markdowns  lower gross margins due to the necessity of providing discounts to retailers and the inability to sell such products through our own factory outlet stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our revenues and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including o the timing and shipment of individual orders  o market acceptance of footwear and other products offered by us  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o mix of products sold  o changes in product pricing  o general economic conditions  and  o weather 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact our results of operations for a particular quarter 
our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we conduct operations in various international countries  and a portion of our sales is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  our financial results have been affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to protect us from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful  and currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns the athletic and casual footwear and athletic apparel industries in which we compete are generally characterized by significant seasonality of sales and results of operations 
sales of our saucony brand and hind brand products have historically been seasonal in nature  with the strongest sales generally occurring in the first and second quarters for our saucony brand and the first and third quarters for our hind brand 
we believe that sales of our products will continue to follow this seasonal cycle 
therefore  our results of operations for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
our operating results may be affected by order cancellations customers may cancel orders of our products at any time without financial penalty 
as a result  our backlog does not necessarily represent actual future shipments 
the rate of customer cancellations can vary quarter to quarter and year to year 
if the retail market continues to be weak or weakens again in the future  our customers could cancel further orders of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are susceptible to financial difficulties of retailers we sell our products primarily to major retailers  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect the future financial condition of such retailers will have on our business 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that our bad debt expenses will not be material in future periods 
we need effective marketing and advertising programs because consumer demand for our products is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising 
failure of such investments to achieve the desired effect in terms of increased retailer acceptance or consumer purchase of our products could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we believe that our success depends in part upon our ability to periodically launch new marketing and advertising programs 
if we are unable to successfully design or execute new marketing and advertising  or if such programs are ineffective  we may not be able to increase or maintain our sales and our brand image 
we depend on key customers approximately of our gross trade receivables balance was represented by customers at january  we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will depend to a significant extent upon sales to major customers 
the loss of or a reduction in the level of sales to one or more major customers or the failure of a major customer to proceed with a large order or to timely pay us for a large order could materially reduce our sales 
declines in revenue in our retail stores could adversely affect profitability we have made significant capital investments in opening retail stores and incur significant expenditures in operating these stores 
the higher level of fixed costs related to our retail organization can adversely affect profitability  particularly in the first half of the year  as our revenue historically has been more heavily weighted to the second half of the year 
our ability to recover the investment in and expenditures of our retail organization can be adversely affected if sales at our retail stores are lower than anticipated 
our gross margin could be adversely affected if off price sales increase as a percentage of revenue 
we depend on the strength of our intellectual property protection of our products we use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products 
we have registered our marks in the united states and in a number of foreign countries 
we may not be able to register or use our marks in each foreign country in which we seek to register them 
moreover  the registrations we seek and secure may be inadequate 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our trademarks 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business our business is sensitive to consumers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions  such as interest and taxation rates  employment levels and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial position 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the impact of these changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in order to achieve these objectives we identify the risks and manage them by adjusting fixed and variable rate debt positions and selectively hedging foreign currency risks 
borrowings under our credit facilities are based on floating rates  which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
our primary market risk is the risk of exposure to unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge firm and anticipated purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
the purpose of our currency hedging activities is to protect our local subsidiaries cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our forward exchange contracts principally hedge us denominated transactions with our canadian  dutch and british subsidiaries 
while we have a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  this program may not fully insulate us against short term fluctuations in financial results 
currency risk the fair value of our forward exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in the currency exchange rates 
as of january   the fair value of our forward exchange contracts was  we have calculated the effect of a depreciation in the year end currency exchange rates related to the forward exchange contracts 
this depreciation would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward exchange contracts of  which would affect our fiscal results of operations and financial position 
the unrealized losses on our forward exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates will be partially offset by gains on the exposures being hedged 
we have also calculated the effect of a depreciation in year end interest rates and have determined the effects to our results of operations and financial position to be immaterial 
we do not expect to make any significant changes in our management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the foreseeable future
