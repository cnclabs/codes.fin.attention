item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview azz incorporated the company operates two distinct segments  the electrical and industrial products segment and the galvanizing services segment 
the electrical and industrial products segment serves the power generation  transmission and distribution markets as well as the general industrial market 
the galvanizing services segment consists of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities located throughout the south and southwest united states that provides a value added galvanizing service to the steel fabrication industry 
for the fiscal year ended february   the company recorded revenues of million compared to the prior year s revenues of million 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated from the electrical and industrial products segment and approximately were generated from the galvanizing services segment 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in the fiscal net income as a percent of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the reduction in net income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower operating margins in the electrical and industrial products segment 
the lower operating margins for this segment are a reflection of the markets in which we participate 
these markets continue to be very competitive as a result of the capacity expansion that occurred during the strong power generation market and has produced more capacity than can be absorbed by the current market 
earnings per share decreased by to 
per share for fiscal compared to per share in fiscal  on a diluted basis 
results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  revenues the company s consolidated net revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  as compared to fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment produces highly engineered specialty products supplied to the power generation  power transmission  power distribution markets and general industrial markets as well as lighting and tubular products to the industrial and petroleum markets 
the segment recorded revenues for fiscal of million  a decrease of below the fiscal results of million 
the reduced revenues result primarily from lower demand from the domestic power generation market in fiscal as compared to fiscal this segment has worked through the backlog that was related to the domestic power generation projects 
in addition to the lack of new domestic power generation projects  the low capital spending levels in the industrial market in fiscal had a negative impact on this segment s revenues 
the federal reserve industrial capacity utilization report  while showing improvement in recent months  still remains below utilization 
factory utilization was at at february  an increase from the posted at november  a return to utilization levels experienced between and  which averaged  would have a positive impact on many of this segment s operations  which are dependant on the industrial market 
the company has continued to intensify its efforts to increase its presence in international markets and improve its position in industrial and utility markets through improvements in this segment s distribution networks 
in fiscal  there were some encouraging results from the efforts in the international markets with the consummation of a co branding and co operative agreement with jiangsu changjiang electric group co  ltd 
of china  and improved representation in the middle east and asia 
these programs will better position the company to take advantage of these markets  which are currently experiencing growth 
the electrical and industrial products segment ended fiscal with a backlog of million  an increase of as compared to fiscal backlog of million 
the segment recorded a book to ship ratio of to for fiscal as compared to 
to in the prior year 
the backlog continues to be heavily weighted towards the distribution market 
the backlog was aided by bookings for this segment s high voltage bus duct product during the later part of fiscal despite some modest improvements in our markets  as 
table of contents indicated by the book to ship ratio  they still remain extremely competitive and price sensitive as the capacity expansion that occurred during the strong power generation market has resulted in much more capacity than can be absorbed by the current market demand 
going into fiscal  the company s major concern for the electrical and industrial products segment remains its ability to sustain the book to ship ratio equivalent to the one that was obtained in fiscal the company s galvanizing services segment  which is made up of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities  generated revenues of million  a decrease from the prior year s revenues of million 
the decline in revenue for fiscal was created by the increase in steel prices during the fourth quarter  which impacted many of our steel fabrication customers and delayed some scheduled projects 
due to this segment s broad customer base  and multiple locations it was able to minimize the impact of the increased steel prices on its operations 
as steel prices stabilize  revenues should return to levels experienced in fiscal and any improvements in the economy or the industrial market should provide additional opportunities for increased revenues 
operating income the company s consolidated operating income see note to note to consolidated financial statements decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal consolidated operating margins as a percent of sales declined in fiscal to as compared to fiscal operating margins of 
the decline in operating income and margins was the direct result of lower revenues  primarily in the electrical and industrial segment and intense competition in both of the company s segments  which again resulted from difficult market conditions 
the company has sized its operations in both of its segments to reflect the extremely competitive conditions facing each of them and has continued to improve operating efficiencies which should result in improved financial performance 
while significant progress has been made in this area  the company continues to search out and seek additional improvements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began the implementation of a new erp system  which is scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal once the conversion is completed additional efficiencies should be recognized 
the electrical and industrial products segment generated of the operating income for fiscal  while the galvanizing services segment produced the remaining 
operating income for the electrical and industrial products segment declined million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for fiscal operating margins for this segment declined to for the current year as compared to for fiscal the operating profits and margins were significantly impacted by a reductions in revenues coupled with continued price competition within the markets in which these products are sold 
while the company continued to implement operational efficiencies and cost reductions it could not offset the dramatic reductions in revenues 
the company continues to align and consolidate resources to match current market conditions  while still maintaining its ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise as market conditions improve 
operating income for the galvanizing service segment declined  or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for the prior year 
operating margins were consistent at for the compared periods of fiscal and the operating income decline is attributable to a slight reduction in revenues and increased cost for natural gas 
this segment continues to benefit from the sizing of its operations to match market conditions 
the recent metal commodity pricing including the cost of zinc is of concern 
this increase may have an adverse impact on this segment s operating results in fiscal difficult market conditions may inhibit the ability to fully recover through increased selling prices the anticipated increases in the cost of zinc 
it is difficult to determine at this time what the overall customer reaction will be to our attempted recovery of the increased cost of zinc 
this is a critical factor that impacts all participants in the hot dip galvanizing business 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses were million for fiscal and fiscal as a percent of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the percentage increase

the full year of revenues received during fiscal from the company s fiscal acquisitions accounted for the increased revenues for this segment 
revenues from the acquisitions of central electric company and carter crawley  inc for the full year of operation in fiscal as compared to four months of operations in fiscal increased million or 
excluding the acquisitions  revenues for the electrical and industrial products segment decreased to million for fiscal the decline in revenue resulted from a weak industrial market for all of fiscal and a significant reduction in the fourth quarter in sales to the power generation market 
the company aggressively attempted to offset the downturn in the power generation market and weak industrial market with an increased presence in the international market place  an increased presence in the power distribution and transmission markets  as well as the industrial markets in general  but was hampered by the overall weak economic conditions and intense competition in all markets served 
the electrical and industrial products segment ended fiscal with a backlog of million  a decrease of from a backlog of million at the end of fiscal the backlog excluding acquisitions decreased to million at the end of fiscal activity levels for for the industry returned to levels prior to the dynamic expansion of the domestic power generation market as a result of deregulation 
the company s galvanizing services segment generated revenues of million  a decrease from the prior year s revenues of million 
the continuation of the weakness in the overall economic environment from fiscal prevented any internal growth in our galvanizing services segment for fiscal operating income the company s consolidated operating income see note to note to consolidated financial statements increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal improved operating income was the result of increased revenues from our electrical and industrial products segment and cost containments implemented across all of our operating segments 
consolidated operating margins as a percent of sales declined in fiscal to from the previous years operating margins of 
the overall decrease in margins resulted from the softness and intense competition in the electrical and industrial products segment s markets  as well as the closure of the company s nashville facility 
as a result of the changing market 
table of contents conditions  the company implemented stringent cost controls  improved operating efficiencies  accelerated the assimilation of the prior year acquisitions  and aggressively pursued all market opportunities 
with these actions  the company has positioned itself to better manage operations under these market conditions  while maintaining it s ability to capitalize on future improvements in the economy 
in the electrical and industrial products segment  operating income for fiscal increased to million  an increase of as compared to million in fiscal these results were aided by the elimination in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

the company incurred  in cost associated with closing the nashville facility 
these cost consisted of a  write off of the locations leasehold improvements   lease termination costs  and  in severance cost paid 
as of february   the operation was totally transferred to two of the company s other facilities 
in the galvanizing services segment  operating income increased to million for fiscal as compared million in fiscal operating margins were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal these results were aided by the elimination in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
of goodwill amortization which has been taken in the amount of  for fiscal during fiscal  the segment benefited from the stabilization of natural gas and reduced zinc costs 
costs containments implemented in fiscal and continued in fiscal contributed to the higher margins experienced 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of from fiscal as a percent of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease is attributable to lower cost for professional services and employee benefit programs

approximately million will be spent in the company s galvanizing services segment for routine capital improvements to maintain  upgrade and enhance the operational efficiencies of this segment s facilities and approximately million will be spent on the installation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
commodity pricing the company manages its exposure to commodity prices  primarily zinc used in its galvanizing services segment  by utilizing contracts with its zinc suppliers that include protective caps that reduce the company s exposure to rising commodity prices 
the company utilizes these contracts for approximately of its zinc requirements 
the contracts are normally negotiated in december of each year and normally are for a twelve month period of time 
management believes these contractual agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings 
in the electrical and industrial segment  the company has exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may be difficult to obtain 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates that affect the reported value of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for the company s conclusions 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as the business and the economic conditions change 
accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals for contingent liabilities  revenue recognition and impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
more information regarding significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying value of the accounts receivables is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments 
the allowance is determined by historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  overall level of outstanding accounts receivables  information about specific customers with respect of their inability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accruals for contingent liabilities the amounts the company records for estimated claims such as self insurance programs  warranty and other contingent liabilities requires the company to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
the company uses past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results may be different than the company s estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for the galvanizing services segment upon completion of the galvanizing services or shipment of product 
revenue is recognized for the electrical and industrial products segment upon transfer of title and risk to customers  or based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting as contract services are performed 
the extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total 
table of contents contract costs at completion 
contract costs include direct labor and material  and certain indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are able to be determined 
the assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated 
impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill the company records impairment losses on long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
in those situations  impairment loss on a long lived asset is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
a significant change in events  circumstances or projected cash flows could result in an impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets 
an annual impairment test of goodwill will be performed in december of each future year 
the test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows from the company s operating segments 
based on the present value of the future cash flow  the company will determine whether impairment will be recorded 
a significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years 
on march   the company adopted sfas no 
see recent accounting pronouncements below 
the company completed its annual impairment analysis for its two operating segments and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  an annual impairment test will be performed in december of each year 
the test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows from the company s operating segments 
a significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
application of the non amortization provisions of the statement increased the company s income before income taxes by approximately million in and for more information on the adoption of sfas no 
 see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fin no 
fin  consolidation of variable entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that companies are not required to consolidate but in which a company has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  in december  the fasb revised fin through the release of fin r  which clarifies certain aspects of fin and contains certain provisions that defer the effective date of fin to periods ending after march  the company does not expect fin to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some 
table of contents circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relating to the company s operations results primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
the company manages its exposures to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt 
the company had approximately million of variable rate borrowings at february  after its hedges 
on the company s variable interest rate borrowings  a one percent upward or downward change in interest rates would equate to an approximate  increase or decrease to interest expense 
in november  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement with its lender to modify the interest characteristics of million of debt from variable rate to a fixed rate 
in conjunction with the company s financing agreement the company discontinued hedge accounting for the february interest rate swap effective november  due to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on this swap  the company recorded  to interest income during fiscal at february  the fair value of the february swap was a liability of  the november interest rate swap  which was designated as a hedge of the company s variable rate interest  has an unrealized loss of  as of february  the accumulated balance in other comprehensive income is  net of tax of  as of february  this amount will be charged to interest expense over the respective terms of the two swaps 
the company believes it has adequately protected itself from increased interest cost under these financial arrangements 
the company manages its exposures to commodity prices  primarily zinc used in its galvanizing services segment  by utilizing contracts with its zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices 
management believes these contractual agreements ensure adequate supplies and partial offset against exposure to commodity price swings 
in the electrical and industrial segment  the company has exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may be difficult to obtain 
the company does not believe that a hypothetical change of of the interest rate currently in effect or a change of of commodity prices would have a significantly adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that either interest rates or commodity prices will not change in excess of that hypothetical amount
