item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
overview we are a worldwide provider of information technology commonly referred to as it services and business solutions to a broad range of customers 
we offer our customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business objectives  chosen from a breadth of services  including technology outsourcing  business process outsourcing  development and integration of systems and applications  and business and technology consulting services 
with this approach  our customers benefit from integrated service offerings that help synchronize their strategy  systems  and infrastructure 
as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
our customers may contract with us for any one or more of our services  which fall into the following categories it outsourcing services includes multi year contracts in which we assume operational responsibility for various aspects of our customers businesses  including application systems  technology infrastructure  and some back office functions 
we typically hire a significant portion of the customers staff that has supported these functions 
we then apply our expertise and operating methodologies to increase the efficiency of the operations  which usually results in increased operational quality at a lower cost 
our it outsourcing contracts are priced using a variety of mechanisms  including level of effort  direct costs plus a fee which may be either a fixed amount or a percentage of direct costs incurred  fixed price  unit price  and risk reward 
depending on a customer s business requirements and the pricing structure of the contract  the cash flows from a contract can vary significantly during a contract s term 
with fixed price contracts or when an upfront payment is required to purchase assets  an it outsourcing contract will typically produce less cash flow at the beginning of the contract with significantly more cash flow generated as efficiencies are realized later in the term 
with a cost plus contract  the cash flows tend to be relatively consistent over the term of the contract 
business process services includes services such as claims processing  revenue cycle management  travel agent commission settlement  and engineering services  which we offer on a stand alone basis 
we classify our business process services in three categories transaction processing services  back office services  and professional services related to non technical functions 
consulting services includes services such as application development and maintenance  system design and implementation services  application systems migration and testing  and management consulting and it strategy services  which we offer to customers typically on a short term basis 
we offer our services under three primary lines of business it solutions  government services and consulting 
we consider these three lines of business to be reportable segments and include financial information and disclosures about these reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements 
you can find this financial information in note  segment and certain geographic data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements below 
we routinely evaluate the historical performance of and growth prospects for various areas of our business  including our lines of business  vertical industry groups  and service offerings 
based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of varying factors  we may increase or decrease the amount of ongoing investment in each of these business areas  make acquisitions that strengthen our market position  or divest  exit  or downsize aspects of a business area 
during the past four years  we have used our acquisition program to strengthen our business in the healthcare and consulting markets and expand into the government market 
at the same time  we have divested  or exited  certain service offerings and joint ventures that did not meet our criteria for continued investment 

table of contents results of operations change in accounting principle for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below in critical accounting policies under the heading revenue recognition  we changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customers 
our adoption of eitf effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenues associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
this adjustment also includes approximately million of expense approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  to recognize an estimated loss on a construction service included in a contract that we expected to be profitable in the aggregate over its term and that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
to illustrate the impact of the adoption of eitf on our financial results for and  we have shown in the table below the pro forma revenue  gross profit  gross margin and net income loss as if eitf had been applied during the years ended december  and amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  impact from pro forma impact from pro forma reported eitf amounts reported eitf amounts revenue gross profit gross margin net income loss the impact of eitf on the years ended december  and  as reflected above  applied only to the it solutions segment and to domestic contracts 
exiting of a customer contract in  we entered into a long term fixed price it outsourcing contract with a customer  which included various non construction services and a construction service  which was an application development project 
in  we began to expect that the actual cost to complete the application development project would exceed the cost estimate included in the contract with the customer 
the contract provided for us to collect most of the excess of the actual cost over the cost estimate in the contract  but we expected the project to generate a loss because we did not expect to collect all of the excess of the actual cost over the cost estimate in the contract 
however  we did not recognize a loss on the contract at that time because we expected that the contract would be profitable in the aggregate over its term 
as part of our adoption of eitf in the first quarter of  we separated the deliverables in the contract into multiple units of accounting and recognized a net estimated loss on the application development project totaling approximately million approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  which was recorded as part of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
if eitf had been in effect during and  the million net estimated loss on the application development project would have had the following net impact on revenue  direct cost of services and gross profit for the years ended december  and in millions december  december  revenue direct cost of services gross profit in the second quarter of  we were unable to reach agreement with the customer on the timing and form of payment for the excess of the actual cost over the cost estimate in the contract 
as a result  we exited 
table of contents this contract and recorded an additional million of expense in direct cost of services in the second quarter of  which consists of the following the impairment of assets related to this contract totaling million  including the impairment of million of long term accrued revenue  the accrual of estimated costs to exit this contract of million  and partially offsetting the above expenses was the reversal of million in accrued liabilities that had been recognized for future losses that we expected to incur to complete the application development project 
we completed the services necessary to transition certain functions back to the client during the fourth quarter of comparison of to revenue revenue for increased by million  or  to  million from revenue of  million for as noted above  we adopted eitf effective january   which adjusted revenue recognized on existing contracts based on the new criteria of eitf regarding whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
the effect from this change in accounting is reflected above in the presentation of pro forma amounts for revenue  gross profit  gross margin and net income loss for the years ended december  and revenue for increased by million  or  compared to pro forma revenue of  million 
this increase in revenue is due to increases in revenue from the it solutions and government services segments  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the consulting segment 
revenue from the it solutions segment decreased million  or  to  in from  million in and increased million  or  from pro forma revenue of  million in this net increase as compared to pro forma revenue for was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenue from contracts signed during  primarily relating to long term it outsourcing contracts with customers in the healthcare industry 
partially offsetting this increase were million net decrease from existing accounts  short term offerings  and project work that is provided to customers within our long term account base 
within our long term client contracts we typically perform services above our base level of services 
given the discretionary nature of these additional services  the amount of these services that we provide to our customers may fluctuate from period to period depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific client needs  million decrease in revenue as a result of exiting certain business relationships and under performing delivery units during  primarily in the financial services and strategic markets industries 
of this decrease in revenue  million related to fees we received in in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures 
one of these joint ventures was with a european telecommunications company and the other was with a european financial institution 
both of these joint ventures were terminated at the convenience of the customers  resulting in the payments to us of million in termination fees 
the remaining revenue decrease is due primarily to reduced revenue from those two joint ventures as they were terminated in  and million decrease from ubs to million in from million in revenue from government services increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is attributable to the acquisitions of soza company  ltd 
soza in february and adi technology corporation adi in july revenue from the consulting segment decreased to million in from million in due primarily to the weak demand for custom application solutions and package implementation services 

table of contents domestic revenue grew by in to  million from  million in  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from in the prior year 
domestic revenue grew by in from pro forma domestic revenue of  million  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from of total pro forma revenue 
this increase is primarily the result of new contract signings and acquisitions in and non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  decreased by in to million from million in and decreased to of total revenue from of total revenue and of pro forma revenue 
the largest components of european operations are the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for decreased to million from million for in switzerland  revenue for decreased to million from million for these revenue decreases from are due primarily to a revenue decline from ubs  as well as a decrease in the number of customers in these countries  including the two joint ventures that were terminated in asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in gross margin gross margin for was of revenue  which is lower than the gross margin for of and the pro forma gross margin for of 
the following items are important in understanding the decrease in gross margin as compared to the pro forma gross margin for in  we recorded revenue of million and direct cost of services of million  resulting in gross profit of million  associated with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures  in  we received a million payment from a customer in bankruptcy reorganization that was previously believed to be unrecoverable  as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  the pro forma gross profit for includes a reduction of million associated with the adoption of eitf for a contract we exited million as a reduction of revenue and million as an increase in direct cost of services  and as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  in the second quarter of  we recorded million of expense in direct cost of services associated with the exiting of this contract 
without the effects of these items  gross margin for would have decreased to of revenue from a gross margin of in calculated by adjusting the pro forma gross margin of for for the items discussed above 
the year over year decline in gross margin is primarily due to lower up front profitability on new contracts signed during  lower profitability from short term consulting activities  an increase in expense for year end bonuses to be paid to associates  and million of expense associated with unfulfilled minimum purchase commitments 
in addition  during we recorded additional expense for associate year end bonuses as compared to  which reduced gross profit by million 
these items were partially offset by higher margins from acquisitions and improvements in long term commercial account profitability  including an increase in profitability for certain fixed price contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for decreased to million from million in sg a for was of revenue  which is lower than sg a for of of pro forma revenue 
in our analysis of sg a for both and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change during  we recorded million of expense in sg a relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities and million of expense associated with our response to investigations of the california energy crisis  and during  we recorded a reduction of expense of million resulting from revising our estimate of liabilities associated with actions in prior years to streamline our operations  which included a favorable resolution of an employment dispute 

table of contents without the effects of these items  sg a would have increased by million  or  to million for from million for as a percentage of revenue  sg a would have decreased to of revenue for from of pro forma revenue for other statement of operations items interest income  net  decreased by to million in from million in due to a decrease in the average cash balance in as compared to and an overall decrease in interest rates 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated affiliates  which primarily represents our share of the earnings of hcl perot systems bv hps  an information technology services joint venture based in india  was a million loss in as compared to million of earnings in this change from is primarily related to expenses associated with resolving the ownership structure of the hps joint venture  which negatively impacted our equity in hps earnings of approximately million and related primarily to stock option compensation expense 
included in the million of earnings from hps in was a charge to write down the goodwill related to an acquisition  which reduced our equity in earnings by approximately million  and million of expense related to a contingent liability 
on december   we acquired hcl technologies shares in hps  and changed the name of hps to perot systems tsi bv because of the late december closing of this acquisition  the post acquisition results of operations of perot systems tsi were not material to our consolidated results of operations for as a result  we continued to account for perot systems tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december   and the balance of our investment in tsi at december   was million 
we consolidated the assets and liabilities of tsi as of december  other income expense  net  was million of income in as compared to million of expense in during  we recorded non investment interest income of million and a million gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities 
during  we recorded a million loss when we divested our equity investment in billingzone  a start up joint venture

comparison of to revenue revenue for increased million  or  to  million from revenue of  million for as noted above  on january   we adopted eitf and changed our method of accounting for revenue from agreements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customer contracts 
the effect from this change in accounting is reflected above in the presentation of pro forma amounts for revenue  gross profit  gross margin and net income loss for the years ended december  and pro forma revenue for increased by million  or  compared to pro forma revenue of  million 
this increase in revenue was due to increases in revenue from the it solutions and government services segments  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the consulting segment 
revenue from the it solutions segment increased to  million in from  million in pro forma revenue from the it solutions segment increased million  or  to  million in from pro forma revenue of  million in this increase was primarily attributable to million in revenue from acquisitions consummated in and in the healthcare market  million in revenue from contracts signed during with new and existing customers in which the scope of services to be provided was expanded  
table of contents million from other existing accounts  primarily in the healthcare industry and primarily related to a full year of revenue in on a new contract that was signed in the middle of  and million of revenue in relating to fees paid in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures 
one of these joint ventures was with a european telecommunications company and the other was with a european financial institution 
both of these joint ventures were terminated after the service contracts with these customers were terminated at the convenience of the customers  resulting in the payment to us of million in termination fees 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by million decrease as a result of exiting certain business relationships and under performing delivery units and closing geographic project sales efforts in  and million decrease in revenue from ubs 
revenue from ubs decreased to million in from million in due primarily to lower spending by ubs on infrastructure and discretionary project services as a result of cost savings initiatives implemented by us and ubs 
in july  we acquired adi technology corporation and formed our government services segment 
revenue from this segment was million for revenue from the consulting segment decreased to million in from million in due to continued weak demand for custom application development services  partially offset by growth in systems integration and package implementation services 
domestic revenue grew by in to  million from million in  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from in the prior year

the largest components of european operations were the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for decreased to million from million for in switzerland  revenue for decreased to million from million for asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in  respectively 
these revenue decreases from are due to a revenue decline from ubs  as well a decrease in the number of customers in these geographic areas 
gross margin direct costs of services increased in by to  million from million in gross margin increased to of revenue in as compared to of revenue in gross margin increased to of pro forma revenue in as compared to of pro forma revenue in in our analysis of our pro forma gross margin percentages for and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change in  we recorded million of charges  including million relating to the bankruptcy of a customer  anc rental corporation  and million from reducing the basis of software and other assets used in service offerings that we exited 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  the pro forma gross profit for includes an additional million associated with the adoption of eitf for a contract we exited million as additional revenue 
as discussed above in exiting of a customer contract  the pro forma gross profit for includes a reduction of million associated with the adoption of eitf for a contract we exited million as a reduction of revenue and million as an increase in direct cost of services 

table of contents in  we received a million payment from anc that was previously believed to be unrecoverable  and we recorded million of gross profit on million of revenue associated with fees paid in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures that we exited during without the effects of these items  the gross margin for would have decreased to of total revenue from of total revenue in this decrease in gross margin was due primarily to generally lower gross margins on contracts signed since the middle of and on acquisitions consummated in partially offsetting this decline in gross margin was lower expense for associate incentive programs in consistent with market conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for decreased to million from million in sga for was of pro forma revenue  which is lower than sg a for of of pro forma revenue 
in our analysis of sg a for both and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change as discussed in more detail below  in we recorded million in expense relating primarily to severance and facility related costs as a result of realigning our operating structure  in  we recorded an additional million relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities as we continued our efforts to streamline our operations  and during  we recorded million of expense relating to an investigation of our involvement in the california energy market 
without the effects of these items  sg a would have decreased by million  or  to million for from million in as a percentage of pro forma revenue  sg a would have decreased to of pro forma revenue for from of pro forma revenue for this decrease is primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles  which was million in  a temporary decline in selling expense  and our focused efforts to reduce sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
other statement of operations items interest income  net  decreased by to million in from million in due to a decrease in the average cash balance in as compared to and an overall decrease in interest rates

as mentioned above  during we recorded an additional million relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities as we continued our efforts to streamline our operations 
as a result of these realignment activities  we realized savings that helped to offset profit pressures 
during  we recorded a reduction of expense of million resulting from revising our estimate of liabilities associated with actions in prior years to streamline our operations 
as a result of these realignment activities  we reduced both our direct cost of services and our sg a expenses  primarily resulting from reduced salary and facility costs 
these expense reductions helped offset profit pressures that we have experienced since we are unable to determine whether these savings will continue to be realized in the future  as we may decide to increase our spending in sg a areas as our business or the market environment changes 
liquidity and capital resources during  cash and cash equivalents decreased to million from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the following items are important in understanding this change long term accrued revenue increased by million in as compared to an increase of million in as discussed above  we adopted eitf effective january  this change in our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables had the impact of reducing the amount of revenue that we recorded on long term fixed price contracts during as compared to  amounts paid associated with our prior years realigned operating structure activities in decreased as compared to by million  year end bonuses paid to associates in decreased as compared to by approximately million  and net cash paid for income taxes increased by million  with net tax payments of million in compared to net tax payments of million in net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a million increase in the amount of net cash paid for acquisitions of businesses

table of contents partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in purchases of property  equipment and software in for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of cash received upon the exercise of options to purchase class a common stock and class b common stock during as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in the number of shares of our class a common stock that we repurchased in as compared to we routinely maintain cash balances in certain european and asian currencies to fund operations in those regions 
during  foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our non domestic cash balances by million  as british pounds  swiss francs  and euros all strengthened against the us dollar 
our foreign exchange policy does not call for hedging foreign exchange exposures that are not likely to impact net income or working capital 
as discussed below under subsequent events  on january   we entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that allows us to borrow up to million 
we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  expected cash flows from operating activities  and the million available under the revolving credit facility will provide us sufficient funds to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future

we are currently satisfying the minimum purchase requirements for two of the vendors 
with regard to the third vendor  under the terms and conditions of this agreement  we agreed to purchase or sell services having a gross value of million over a four year commitment period 
we entered into discussions with this vendor to restructure the terms of the commitment 
because both parties were unable to agree to change the terms  we have entered into arbitration  which we 
table of contents expect to be resolved in the first half of in  we recorded expense of million associated with this unfulfilled minimum purchase commitment 
in june  we entered into an agreement with an airline to purchase a minimum of million of air travel mileage on an annual basis for five years

as discussed in note  termination of business relationships  during we exited an under performing contract 
as a result of the exiting of this contract  we determined that certain contract related assets were impaired and additional expenses would be incurred related to the exiting of this contract  resulting in a loss of million recorded in direct cost of services 
this estimated loss represents our current estimate of the loss related to exiting this contract 
the amount of actual loss with respect to exiting this contract may exceed our current estimates 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services to our customers under contracts that contain various pricing mechanisms and other terms 
these services generally fall into one of the following categories it outsourcing services includes application systems outsourcing  technology infrastructure outsourcing including mainframe and network support services  maintenance services and helpdesk services  and back office outsourcing 
the fees under these arrangements are generally based on the level of effort incurred in delivering the services  including cost plus and time and materials fee arrangements  on a contracted fixed price for contracted services  or on a contracted per unit price of each service delivered 
the term of our outsourcing contracts generally range between five and ten years 
business process services includes services such as claims processing  revenue cycle management  travel agent commission settlement  and engineering services 
the fees for these services are generally based on time and materials  on a contracted price per unit of service delivered  or on a contracted fixed price for the contracted level of services 
the term of our business process services contracts generally range from month to month to five years 
consulting services includes services such as application development and maintenance  system design and implementation services  application systems migration and testing  and management 
table of contents consulting and it strategy services 
the fees for these services are generally based on a contracted level of effort  including time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts  and on a contracted fixed price 
the term of our consulting contracts varies based on the complexity of the services provided and the customers needs 
within these three categories of services  our contracts include non construction type service deliverables including technology and back office outsourcing  and construction type service deliverables  such as application development 
revenue for non construction type service deliverables is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when services are rendered  evidence of arrangement exists  usually evidenced by a signed contract  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
specifically  revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the term  regardless of the amounts that can be billed in each period  unless there is a better measure of performance or delivery 
revenue from time and materials contracts and unit priced contracts is recognized as the services are provided at the contractual stated price 
if the contractual per unit prices within a unit priced contract change during the term of the contract  then we evaluate whether it is more appropriate to record revenue based on the average per unit prices during the term of the contract or based on the actual amounts billed 
revenue from cost plus contracts is recognized as the cost is incurred 
for construction type services  revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  sop requires the use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as our work progresses  and we generally use the cost or hours incurred to date to measure our progress towards completion 
this method relies on estimates of total expected costs or total expected hours to complete the construction service  which are compared to costs or hours incurred to date  to arrive at an estimate of how much revenue and profit has been earned to date 
because these estimates may require significant judgment  depending on the complexity and length of the construction services  the amount of revenues and profits that have been recognized to date are subject to revisions 
if we do not accurately estimate the amount of costs or hours required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then revenues and profits may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in contracts for both non construction and construction services  we may bill the customer prior to performing the service  which would require us to record deferred revenue 
in other contracts  we may perform the service prior to billing the customer  which would require us to record an unbilled receivable 
multiple element arrangements prior to our adoption of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  effective january  as discussed below  we accounted for revenue from contracts containing both non construction and construction services  on a combined basis 
for such contracts with both non construction and construction services  we recognized revenue and profit on all services combined using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the provisions of sop as described above  under the percentage of completion method  the amount of revenue and profit was determined based on the direct costs incurred to date as compared to the estimate of total expected direct costs at completion 
adoption of eitf on november   the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf  regarding when an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
we were required to apply the provisions of eitf to all new arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  alternatively  we were permitted to apply eitf to existing arrangements and record the effect of adoption as the cumulative effect of a 
table of contents change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted eitf and changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customer contracts 
for those contracts which contain both non construction and construction services  we first determine whether each service  or deliverable  meets the separation criteria of eitf in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each separate unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a unit of accounting that has already been delivered is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another separate unit of accounting 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each separate unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each separate unit of accounting as described previously based on the nature of the arrangement 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are combined into one unit of accounting  and the appropriate revenue recognition method is applied 
our adoption of eitf effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenues associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
this adjustment also includes approximately million of expense approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  to recognize an estimated loss on a construction service included in a contract that we expected to be profitable in the aggregate over its term and that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenues of approximately million  which had been recognized prior to january  and reversed in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon adoption of eitf our accounting records for the year ended december  were prepared using the separation criteria of eitf  so for those contracts which contain both non construction and construction services  only construction service deliverables meeting the separation criteria of eitf were subject to our percentage of completion accounting controls and procedures

valuation of goodwill and intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise the estimates and assumptions we used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

based upon our estimates of future taxable income and review of available tax planning strategies  we believe that it is more likely than not that only million of such net deferred tax assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance at december   of million relating primarily to certain foreign jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of this valuation allowance based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenues and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
however  we may increase our hedging activities due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in tsi due to increased foreign currency exposures inherent in tsi s business
