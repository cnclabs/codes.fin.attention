cmg generally recognizes revenues as services are performed based on staffing hours  number of contacts or participants handled by cmg or a flat monthly fee 
supplemental revenues can sometimes be earned depending on service levels or achievement of certain performance measurement targets 
the company recognizes these supplemental revenues only after it has achieved the required measurement target 
the company expects that growth of outsourced customer management and employee care services will be driven by the trend of large companies and governmental agencies turning to outsourcers to provide cost effective  high quality customer support and employee care solutions 
additionally  the company also believes that the expansion of offshore capacity  which provides customer management clients with significantly lower costs and a highly educated labor force  will drive growth in the industry 
despite this trend  cmg s operating margins in the near term will continue to be challenged as pricing pressure intensifies and as it continues to invest in its employee care operations and customer contact center capacity in india and in the philippines

table of contents after an extended period of rapid growth  the communications industry has experienced over the last couple of years one of the most difficult periods in its history 
communications companies have focused their attention on cost reduction and margin improvement  with lower investment in billing information systems 
this has had an adverse impact on img s revenues and operating margin 
for the near future  img expects that it will continue to be challenged by pricing pressure and nominal subscriber growth by leading north american wireless carriers 
however  as communications companies continue to expand their service offerings  the requirements of billing information systems are becoming increasingly complex 
in order to remain competitive  the company believes that many communications companies will turn to third party vendors  such as convergys  for their billing information system needs 
despite the challenges facing both segments  the company believes that its financial structure and condition are solid 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and  of equity

under the lease agreement  which has been classified as an operating lease  the company s monthly lease payments include a fixed and variable component 
the company chose this structure as it provides a cost of financing lower than a traditional mortgage loan or a traditional operating lease 
upon termination or expiration  the company must either purchase the property from the lessor for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the financed by the lessor  the company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  the company is entitled to collect the excess 
the company recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
the company has recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which will be amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  the company also provides certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
the company does not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
the company has concluded that it is not required to consolidate the lessor pursuant to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as the company is not the primary beneficiary 
additionally  the company is not required to consolidate the office complex and the related lease as the lease does not qualify as a variable interest entity 

table of contents the company believes that its present ability to borrow is greater than its established credit facilities in place 
if market conditions change and the company experiences a significant decline in revenues  its cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
this could cause rating agencies to lower the company s credit ratings  thereby increasing its borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of its access to debt and ability to raise additional equity 
on january   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common shares 
on april   the board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to million of its common shares 
the company repurchased million shares of convergys stock for pursuant to these authorizations 
the company may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and the company s liquidity 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods contractual obligation total less than year years after years debt operating leases purchase commitments total this relates to contractual payments for various communication services 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately related to performance and payment guarantees 
the company believes that any obligation that may arise will not be material 
market risk the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on its operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  the company exposes itself to some counterparty credit risk 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which it enters into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   the company had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and had sold in accounts receivable on a variable rate basis 
the carrying amount of the company s borrowings reflects fair value due to its short term and variable interest rate features 
the company uses cash flow hedges for interest rate exposure from time to time 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding cash flow hedges covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon the company s exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the british pound  the indian rupee  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the company currently uses forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 

table of contents cmg serves a number of its us based customer management clients using contact center capacity in canada and in india 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by cmg to operate these non us contact centers are denominated in canadian dollars or india rupees  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
the canadian dollar cad strengthened from per us dollar at december  to per us dollar at december  once translated into us dollars  this resulted in approximately in additional operating expenses  which was mostly offset by gains that resulted from the settlement and maturity of the company s canadian dollar forward exchange contracts 
as of december   the company had open canadian forward exchange contracts maturing during the first half of  the second half of  the first half of and the second half of with notional values in canadian dollars of cad  cad  cad and cad  respectively 
the average exchange rates of these forward exchange contracts were   and  respectively 
this compares to an average hedged exchange rate of during critical accounting policies goodwill at december   the company had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
as required  the company completed its annual impairment tests for its reporting units during the fourth quarter of based on the results of the first step  the company had no goodwill impairment related to its four reporting units information management international  information management north america  customer management and employee care 
although the company makes every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of its estimate of the fair value of its reporting units  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
for example  a variance in the company s estimate of its information management international reporting unit s fair value could result in it performing the second step of the impairment test as described above for the of goodwill recorded by this reporting unit 
a decrease  however  in the estimate of any of the other three reporting units would not lead to any further tests for impairment 
deferred charges in connection with certain of the company s outsourcing arrangements  the company from time to time will incur direct and incremental costs  consisting principally of non refundable cash payments made to clients  to acquire or extend a contractual relationship 
to the extent recovery of these costs is probable  the company capitalizes these costs and amortizes them ratably over the life of the contract as a reduction of revenue 
in connection with its outsourcing arrangements  the company also performs initial implementations  which include the installation and customization of its proprietary software in its centers 
under these arrangements  the client does not take possession of the software nor has the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant economic penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain license arrangements  the company defers all revenue related to the arrangement including revenues related to the implementation services and recognizes it over the period the company is providing support and maintenance 
the company capitalizes all direct and incremental costs of the implementations  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortizes them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
at inception and throughout the term of the contract  the company evaluates recoverability by considering profits to be earned under the related contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
the company s estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on its estimate of costs 
although the company makes every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  the company may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  the company s entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that the company was in breach of contract 
however  based on its evaluation of the related contracts as of december   the company believes that the of deferred charges is recoverable 

table of contents revenue recognition for certain img contracts  the company recognizes software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  less than of the company s consolidated revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of the costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
the company believes it makes every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of its estimates of completion 
restructuring accrual the company recorded significant restructuring and impairment charges related to the reduction in headcount and facility closures during and as of december   the company had of remaining restructuring accruals  principally related to facility closure costs  which will be paid over several years as the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
the company has used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to arrive at the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
the company will continue to evaluate its estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
contingencies the company considers the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and its ability to make a reasonable estimate of its loss 
pursuant to sfas no 
 contingent liabilities  the company accrues for a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements  the company was named as an additional defendant in an action filed with the employment tribunal in glasgow  scotland  by former employees of telesens against telesens in receivership and the three individual receivers receivers 
prior to the company s acquisition of telesens assets  the receivers declared certain employees of telesens redundant and terminated their employment 
the claimants allege that the dismissals were unlawful under scottish law and that the company  as purchaser of the telesens business  is liable for the dismissals 
although not specified in the complaint  the company believes the claimants are seeking damages of approximately the company is defending the case vigorously and intends to continue to do so 
in the event of an adverse judgment  the company believes that the results of the claim would not have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company has made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding the company s financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring its obligations related to its defined benefit plans  valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets  self insurance accruals  determining vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value in connection with its license arrangements and assessing recoverability of intangible assets 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its historical experience and other relevant factors 
the company s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change
