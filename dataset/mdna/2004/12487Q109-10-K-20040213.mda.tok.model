item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business certain risks related to our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
we review the accounting policies  including those described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our accounts receivable  income taxes  goodwill  intangibles  software development  fair value of financial instruments and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors and disclosure committee 
see preparation of financial information in this section for further discussion of the disclosure committee 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and financial statement disclosures and require the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and judgments 
accounts receivable  net 
accounts receivable as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are net of reserves for customer allowances and doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for accounts receivable based on specific identification of customer accounts requiring allowances and the application of a predetermined percentage to the remaining accounts receivable balances 
generally  we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from customers 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of recognition of certain revenue and expense items  the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we establish a tax valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realizable against future taxable income 
during we recorded a net loss of million on the write off of the channelpoint investment and note receivable  including accrued interest 
for tax purposes  million of this loss was considered a capital loss  which can only be offset with net capital gains 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the capital loss will not be realized  therefore  a valuation allowance has been established for this item 
we also have foreign net operating losses from prior years related to our former ccc international operations 
we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of these foreign net operating losses because realization of these assets is doubtful 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowances would be reversed 
in  the company filed amended income tax returns to claim research and experimentation tax credits applicable to the years  and and recorded a credit to income tax expense of million  which was the company s best estimate of the amount of tax credits to be realized 
the company also recorded research and experimentation credits of million for during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional research tax credit of million 
the company also reviewed its tax reserves in conjunction with the completion of the internal revenue service tax audit for the years to and recorded a favorable adjustment of million 
goodwill and intangibles 
under the provisions of sfas no 
business combinations the purchase method of accounting is used for all business combinations 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the excess of purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets of acquired businesses is recorded as goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
under sfas  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the goodwill balance as of december  was million 
the balance from the acquisition that included the ccc valuescope service is million and the remaining balance of million represents the goodwill from the comp est acquisition completed during february see note  acquisition 
we performed our annual impairment analysis during the second quarter of intangible assets as of december  include million for customer relationships and million for acquired software  both of which are being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the values of such assets are not recoverable 
software development costs 
the company expenses research and development costs as they are incurred 
the company evaluates the establishment of technological feasibility of its software products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company sells its software products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
accordingly  technological feasibility of the company s software products is generally not established until the development of the software product is nearly complete 
the company defines technological feasibility as the completion of a working model 
the period of time during which costs should be capitalized  from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release  has historically been very short and  consequently  amounts subject to capitalization have not been significant 
should our development process change significantly the company would reevaluate the impact of sfas no 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amount of our financial instruments approximates their estimated fair value based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instruments 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these investments and notes receivable may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include market conditions  valuations for similar companies  financial performance and a going concern risk 
commitments and contingencies 
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
during  ccc recorded a pre tax charge of million  net of the expected insurance reimbursement of million  as an estimate of the amount that ccc will contribute toward a potential settlement of that would resolve potential claims arising out of approximately of ccc s total transaction volume during the time period covered by the lawsuits 
based on the current status of the settlement discussions  the company anticipates contributing approximately million  net of the expected insurance reimbursement of million  toward an initial settlement that would resolve potential claims arising out of approximately of the company s transaction volume  for valuations involving first party claims  during the period covered by the lawsuits 
as for the remainder of the original million charge  we continue to believe the recorded reserve is necessary and appropriate 
however  the consummation of the settlement with the plaintiffs and the amount of ccc s contribution to the proposed settlement remain subject to a number of significant contingencies  including  among other things  the extent of participation on the part of ccc s insurance company customers  the negotiation of settlement terms between the plaintiffs and those of ccc s customers that are participating in the settlement negotiations  as well as judicial approval of any proposed settlement agreement 
as a result  at this time  there is no assurance that the settlement will be successfully consummated or  if completed  that the final settlement will be on the terms or levels of participation set forth above 
there is also no assurance that existing or potential claims arising out of the remainder of ccc s total loss transaction volume could be settled on comparable terms 
preparation of financial information we believe that the application of accounting standards is as important as the underlying financial data in reporting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that our accounting policies are prudent and provide a clear view of our financial performance 
in  we formed a disclosure committee  composed of senior management  including senior financial and legal personnel  to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of our financial results and disclosures 
in addition  prior to the release of our financial results  key management reviews the our annual and quarterly results  along with key accounting policies and estimates  with the audit committee of our board of directors

   total revenue 






   revenues from ccc pathways increased for the year ended by million  or  compared to the same period of the automotive channel continued to be the key growth driver in this suite as we benefited from our first quarter acquisition of comp est inc and both ccc pathways and ccc pathways digital imaging sales in this channel remained strong 
this growth was partially offset as the insurance channel revenue was down versus the prior year primarily due to lost volume of one customer 
contract renewal rates remain strong with our existing customers and we are seeing increased demand in the mid market 
revenues from ccc valuescope decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of lost business  driven by a number of issues  including the decision by one of our larger customers to transition most of its valuation services to an in house solution during late we have seen customers move to other providers for a variety of reasons  including workflow issues  where certain customers using a competitive estimating platform have decided to switch to the competitor s valuation product 
in other cases  regulatory issues have had an impact  as well as industry consolidation of the customer base 
see regulation section of item business 
revenues from our workflow products increased in by million  or  compared to the prior year mainly due to the continued adoption of the ccc autoverse products 
we continue to focus on the implementation and acceptance process with our customers to help accelerate this suite s revenue growth even further

commissions  royalties and licenses increased by million  or  due to additional license fees  which resulted from the acquisition of repair facility customers through the comp est acquisition completed during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation costs tied to business performance 
the reduced compensation costs reflect anticipated reductions in bonus payments of approximately million for the reductions represent adjustments made to align projected payouts with our final financial results 
we have also continued to focus on controlling expenses  specifically in the management information systems area including the consolidation of our data center operations 
the savings described above were also partially offset by operating expenses related to the comp est acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  as a result of fewer investments in internal use software and customer leased computer equipment as well as using fully amortized software 
this was partially offset by the amortization recorded on the intangible assets acquired from the comp est acquisition 
product development and programming 
product development and programming increased by million  or  due to development projects related to our existing workflow and information products  as well as work being done under a new multi customer contract 
in  we expensed million of research and development funding made to a third party software development company

this charge was based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies that establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for loss contingencies 
as settlement negotiations have progressed  the number of participants and the cost of the proposed settlement have fluctuated 
based on the current status of those discussions  ccc anticipates completing an initial settlement that would eliminate the viability of class claims in of the class actions  pending in the trial and appellate courts against the company and certain of its customers related to ccc valuescope and would resolve potential claims arising out of approximately of the company s total transaction volume  for valuations involving first party claims  during the time period covered by the lawsuits 
the company estimates that its contribution toward such a settlement would be approximately million  net of the expected insurance reimbursement of million 
as for the remainder of the original million charge  we continue to believe the recorded reserve is necessary and appropriate 
the company currently anticipates that the proposed settlement would include a resolution of any potential claims for indemnification or contribution by its customers relating to the transactions covered by the settlement 
however  the consummation of the settlement with the plaintiffs and the amount of ccc s contribution to the proposed settlement remain subject to a number of significant contingencies  including  among other things  the extent of participation on the part of ccc s insurance company customers  the negotiation of settlement terms between the plaintiffs and those of ccc s customers that are participating in the settlement negotiations  as well as judicial approval of any proposed settlement agreement
