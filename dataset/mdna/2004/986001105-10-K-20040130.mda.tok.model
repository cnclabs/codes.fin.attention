item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general yocream internationals primary focus is on manufacturing  marketing and sales of superior quality frozen yogurt  frozen custard  sorbet  smoothie  coffee latte and ice cream products in a variety of premium  low fat  and nonfat flavors in either non organic or organic formulations 
the company also copacks similar products for other companies 
due to the nature of these products  sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the summer months normally being the busiest season 
the introduction and roll out of new products has tended to level the seasonal fluctuations 
in fiscal  the company achieved a increase in sales  primarily from new products  which included soft frozen custard  gourmet ice cream  and aseptic coffee latte 
the increase in sales  however  was not as high as expected due to the following economic conditions the sluggish economy and high unemployment have had an impact on the rate of sales growth 
as a result  management has focused on the development of new products that will enable the company to reach new markets 
for example  the company invested over million in for a new aseptic production line to address the market for shelf stable products see manufacturing section 
this processing system  completed in october  will initially produce smoothies and coffee concentrate beverages 
see sales section below 
other products conducive to this processing system are being evaluated to meet the high demand of the away from home marketplace for shelf stable products 
market trends while traditional frozen yogurt remains entrenched in the marketplace  it is presently in its mature stage 
in response  the company has developed unique cultured items in the frozen dessert category 
for example  the company developed a soft serve soy cultured frozen dessert  to appeal to the health conscious consumer 
this product is currently being marketed through a national broadline foodservice distributor under their private label 
see sales section below 
the company has also developed a low carb frozen yogurt to respond to strong consumer demand 
this product will be introduced at food shows in february  the dannon alliance in january  the company initiated a program whereby the sales teams for both the company and dannon began representing their combined product lines to the away from home market 
in unifying the broker sales network to represent both companies  broker changes were made which resulted in a loss of some customers 
yocream regional sales personnel aggressively pursued the program and attention was diverted from the sale of the companys core products 
by the third quarter the program was revised in cooperation with dannon and the companys sales staff refocused its attention on the sales of the companys core products 
the company continues to value its relationship with the dannon company 
the two companies are now representing selected products to specific distribution market segments 
under this arrangement  sales teams are defined involving personnel from both companies to jointly coordinate sales efforts 
the companies expect to find additional opportunities to develop their mutual business interests 
the strength of the dannon name along with yocreams concentration on the foodservice or away from home marketplace is expected to offer opportunities for increased sales and market share in the future 
management believes that the two companies are similar in philosophy  and both companies yogurt products are known for their high live culture count  with an emphasis on product quality and appeal to consumers with concerns for health and nutrition 
other factors in the first two quarters of  the company began selling a proprietary gourmet softened ice cream in a vanilla bean and a coffee variety to a major regional chain of specialty restaurants 
in june the customer suspended purchasing the product due to pricing concerns 
the company has formulated a new product to meet the customers needs and expects sales to begin again in the second quarter of fiscal the company expected a higher level of sales of its coffee latte beverage to its lead customer  which was not achieved in see explanation below 
military sales did not meet anticipated expectations due to troop deployment overseas 
management believes that the sluggish economy  market trends  the temporary diversion of its sales staff  and the other factors listed above will impact sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal  but expects that results will improve through the balance of the year 
while the company achieved a modest sales increase in a tough economy  a decrease in income from operations and a decrease in net income was experienced as a result of the following raw materials the industry experienced increases in raw materials costs including vanilla  cocoa  and sugar 
the company responded with high quality product reformulations 
inventory levels inventory levels were significantly reduced as a result of operating efficiency initiatives 
while the accounting effect of this reduction negatively impacts operating income  management expects future benefits of increased inventory turns  reduced storage expenses  as well as increased cash flow see liquidity section 
coffee latte in the company developed a pre mixed coffee latte product for its lead customer  which resulted in significant sales 
the customer decided it wanted this product in a shelf stable form 
the company responded by having the product co packed aseptically  which resulted in significantly reduced margins 
the customer then accepted an aseptic concentrated form of the product from a competitor  which significantly impacted the companys sales of coffee latte and related economies of scale 
upon completion of the companys aseptic processing system in october  a concentrated shelf stable coffee product was developed  which duplicates the flavor profile of the original product 
the concentrate will be presented to this customer for consideration in new markets 
legal fees the company incurred higher legal fees than expected due to the transition of its former president  to a consultant position 
unusual expenses a freight reimbursement settlement of  with its lead customer was incurred by the company in the underlying circumstances of this charge have been remedied and management believes the matter to be fully resolved 
see details in other income expense in the future  the company may entertain potential acquisitions where appropriate  to broaden its product lines or increase market share 
the company has retained the services of an investment banker to assist in analyzing such opportunities 
in august the companys president  who was one of its founders  retired after years of outstanding service 
he continues to be a major shareholder and the company has retained the benefit of his experience on a consulting basis 
management believes that the companys commitment to the industry evidenced by its significant investment for expansion and its responsible plan for growth effectively positions the company to increase shareholder value
