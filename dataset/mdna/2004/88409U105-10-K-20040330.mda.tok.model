item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results the following information  including  without limitations  the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk that are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of these statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as believe  expect and may 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include product demand fluctuations in the timing and volume of customer requests for its products 
telecommunication systems industry and general economic conditions 
competitive pressure on selling prices 
market acceptance of the company s products and its customer s products and services 
costs associated with possible litigation or settlement  including those related to the use or ownership of intellectual property 
loss of a major customer 
a few customers account for a major portion of the company sales 
a loss of such a customer would have a major adverse impact on the company s results 
third party suppliers increase the risk that the company may not have adequate supply to meet demand 
introduction of new products 
the company s markets are subject to technological change  so its success depends on its ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive 
some of its competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 
the company s future success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain key design engineering  sales and executive personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel  in particular  design engineers  and the company may not be able to attract and retain engineers and other qualified personnel necessary for the development and introduction of new products or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel that may leave its employ 
expense levels  in the short term  are fixed 
sales variances from quarter to quarter would have a significant effect on the results of operations 
other risk factors detailed in this annual report on form k and in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings 
given the uncertainties  the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
results the company reported net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  sales decreased million from the sales of the company s domestic operations declined 
million 
the decrease in sales was in both the direct and indirect channels with the exception of sales of cx to a large domestic telecommunication service provider 
sales to this customer increased million in from the prior year 
the uk distributorship operation decreased 
million in from the prior year  in spite of a favorable foreign currency fluctuation of 
in addition  sales to its largest customer increased in from decreases in sales to its other customers more than offset these improvements 
the company s backlog at december  was 
million versus 
million in in both and  a major portion of the company s domestic revenue came from two customers and a significant portion of the uk distributorship s revenue came from one customer 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on the company 
in  sales declined million from the sales of the company s domestic operations declined million 
this decrease was primarily in the indirect channel and reflects significant reduction in capital spending by telecommunication companies 
the uk distributorship operations sales decreased 
million 
consolidated gross margin was in  in and in included in cost of products sold were inventory obsolescence charges of 
million in  fixed asset impairment and inventory obsolescence charges of million in  and inventory obsolescence charges of 
million in research and development decreased 
million in and 
million in from the prior year 
the decrease in primarily reflects lower contract engineering services and lower personnel cost 
the decrease in reflects lower material costs and recruiting expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased 
million in and million in from the prior year 
the decrease in was due to a 
million decrease in the us operations primarily reflecting lower personnel costs offset by an increase of 
million in the uk primarily reflecting exchange rate variance 
the decrease in was due to a 
million decrease in the us reflecting lower commissions and bonuses and a decrease of 
million in the uk reflecting personnel cost reductions 
other income of million in includes a non cash gain of 
million on the termination of the company s postretirement health benefit plan 
the remaining other income of 
million in  
million in and 
million in is primarily interest income 
the decrease in from is primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average invested balances 
the company s effective tax rate for was versus for and for included in the tax expense is a  increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
forming a conclusion that such an allowance is not needed is difficult when there is evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
included in the effective tax rate in is a favorable adjustment of  to the tax provision attributable to actual amounts differing from previously recorded estimates 
the provision for income taxes is discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation has not had a significant impact on the operating results of the company over the past few years 
technological advances and productivity improvements are continually being applied to reduce costs  thus reducing inflationary pressures on the operating results of the company 
exchange rate changes will impact the reported dollar sales and cost of sales of the company s uk distributorship operations 
in addition  at december   the company s uk distributorship operations had net assets of million  which would be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  the impact of such rate change would be reflected in the translation adjustment recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the company does not hedge this foreign currency net asset exposure 
total rental expense amounted to  in   in and  in future annual payments for long term noncancellable leases for each of the five years in the period ending december  are approximately     and  respectively  and thereafter 
off balance sheet arrangements none

million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
included in and were loans to officers  net of repayments  of 
million and 
million  respectively

working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  and at december  the decreases in working capital in and from the prior year is due to the results of operations 
the company s contractual obligations are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period less more than than contactual obligation total year years years years operating leases  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately 
million  maintaining the current level of expenditures for research and development and may repurchase up to  shares of its common stock in management believes that the cash and cash equivalents at december  and the cash flow  if any  from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term and long term needs 
assumptions and estimates used in critical accounting policies in the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make critical decisions regarding accounting policies and judgments regarding their application 
materially different amounts could be reported under different circumstances and conditions 
revenue revenue is recognized when earned 
the company generally recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment and in certain circumstances upon acceptance by the customers 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence in and  due to a prolonged slow down in spending by telecommunication service providers  inventory turnover has slowed 
the company recorded charges of 
million and million and to reduce its carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
if future capital expenditures by telecommunication service providers do not increase or decrease further  additional charges may be required 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company has a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
in making such a determination  the company considers its current and past performance  the market environment in which it operates  estimated future earnings  tax planning strategies and other factors 
in the future  as these factors change  a change in the valuation reserve may be required 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the company s pension plan assets have earned in excess of  therefore  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of gains losses are amortized to expense in accordance with sfas no 
the plan assets earned a rate of return in excess of the assumed rate of return in and less than the assumed rate of return in at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   the company used a rate of 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
item a market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities
