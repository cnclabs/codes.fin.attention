the angiojet system consists of a drive unit capital equipment that powers a disposable pump and a family of disposable catheters  each aimed at a specific indication 
the main factors in the angiojet system revenue increase were increased sales resulting from the company commencing us marketing of the angiojet system with additional labeling claims and the expansion of its direct sales force

the company has signed contracts with seven purchasing groups in order to accelerate orders and increase market penetration 
these purchasing groups evaluate and screen new medical technologies on behalf of their members  and once they recommend a technology  such as the angiojet system  they negotiate pre determined discounts on behalf of their members

the discounts reduce gross revenue on the income statement  while marketing fees are included in selling  general and administrative expense on the income statement 
the company expects us angiojet system sales to continue to grow primarily through obtaining additional food and drug administration fda approved product uses  introduction of new catheter models for existing indications  introduction of angiojet system related products  more face time selling to existing accounts  peer to peer selling  and the publication of clinical performance and cost effectiveness data

currently  the japanese ministry of health and welfare mhw is reviewing the company s regulatory approval submission
