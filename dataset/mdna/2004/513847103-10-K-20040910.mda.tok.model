item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products including specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets  glassware and candles for the retail  industrial  floral and foodservice markets  and automotive accessories for the original equipment market and aftermarket 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important in understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended june  and our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity and contractual obligations 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere herein 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to our consolidated operating results for the fiscal year ended june   net sales for the year ended june  decreased to  million from the prior year total of  million 
gross margin decreased to million from the prior year comparable total of million 
net income for the current year was million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in the prior year 
our current year results reflected an environment of increased competition and higher raw material costs 
during the year  we found our opportunities to increase prices to be limited and generally not sufficient to offset the impact of the higher material costs 
we have been able to maintain a strong balance sheet with no debt throughout this fiscal year 
our consolidated cash balance increased by million to million compared to the prior year total of million 
overall results were also affected by the decrease in funds received under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of cdsoa 
in fiscal  we received million under cdsoa compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal on december   we purchased substantially all the operating assets of warren frozen foods  inc warren  a privately owned producer and marketer of frozen noodle and pasta products 
warren is reported in our specialty foods segment 
this acquisition s final purchase price was approximately million  including an estimated net asset adjustment of approximately  as determined under the terms of the purchase agreement  and this transaction is discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on april   we announced our intent to close our automotive floor mat manufacturing facility located in waycross  georgia 
we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes 
manufacturing effectively ceased as of june  the decision to close the plant was brought on by a decline in demand for compression molded rubber floor mats that resulted in excess segment capacity 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles automotive expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales net sales and gross margin fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods      glassware and candles 
     automotive      total      gross margin      gross margin as a percent of sales consolidated net sales during fiscal reached  million  essentially flat as compared to the prior year sales level of  million 
sales through fiscal had increased for eleven consecutive years before the decline in fiscal like many other consumer product companies  our sales for fiscals and were impacted by unsettled domestic economic conditions 
we also experienced heightened competitive influences  particularly in nonfood markets 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in and in the specialty foods segment gross margin was lower in fiscal and due to continuing higher ingredient costs  especially soybean oil and certain dairy related products 
the consolidated gross margins have also been impacted by lower margins occurring within the glassware and candles segment 
this segment has experienced significant price competition as well as less favorable fixed cost absorption on reduced production levels 
gross margin as a percentage of sales within the automotive segment has remained flat over the past two fiscal years despite increasing material costs  especially for synthetic rubber  aluminum and steel 
the automotive margins benefited from the inclusion of a million gain on the august sale of an idle manufacturing facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses      sg a expense as a percent of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled million and were down as compared with the total of million and declined million from the total of million 
the total included a second quarter provision for bad debts within the glassware and candles segment of approximately million million after taxes related to our accounts receivable exposure to kmart corporation 
the full year total includes a million recovery of bad debt associated with kmart corporation 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively stable for the years ending june  and  while was impacted by the bad debt provision noted above 
restructuring and impairment charge in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes for costs incurred as of june  related to the closing of our automotive floor mat manufacturing facility located in waycross  georgia 
manufacturing effectively ceased as of june  the decision to close the plant was brought on by a decline in demand for compression molded rubber floor mats that resulted in excess segment capacity 
the cash costs associated with this closure totaled approximately million and included termination benefits and other closing costs  such as costs to remove and relocate certain equipment  costs to prepare the building for sale  and various other charges 
approximately million of the restructuring and impairment charge relates to this facility s impairment of property  plant and equipment 
an analysis of our restructuring activity and the related liability within the automotive segment is as follows in thousands accrual at charge cash outlays june  restructuring and impairment charge employee separation costs other costs subtotal asset impairment total restructuring and impairment charge  the restructuring accrual is located in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at june  we expect that the remaining cash outlays for this plan will occur over the next fiscal year 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes related to the consolidation of certain glass manufacturing operations 
the charge consisted of employee separation costs  pension curtailment costs  closure and cleanup costs  and the writedown of property  plant and equipment having no future utility as a result of the restructuring decision 
the plant consolidation was substantially completed by june the liability that remains for this restructuring is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements 
operating income fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs

operating income specialty foods      glassware and candles      automotive      corporate expenses    total      operating income as a percent of sales specialty foods glassware and candles 
automotive consolidated declines in operating income in each of the three operating segments  due to the factors discussed above  led to consolidated operating income for fiscal totaling million  an decrease from fiscal operating income of million 
the fiscal total had increased from fiscal operating income totaling million 
other income expense in december  january and february  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  under cdsoa 
these amounts were recorded within the accompanying financial statements as other income 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress the unfair dumping of imported products through annual cash payments to eligible affected companies 
we are aware that certain other candle manufacturers have initiated legal proceedings against the us customs and border protection service cbp  claiming a right to share in the total proceeds previously paid  or to be paid  to candle manufacturers currently considered eligible recipients under cdsoa 
there also exists other litigation initiated by plaintiffs other than candle manufacturers that more broadly challenges various aspects of cdsoa  including its constitutionality 
to date  those matters that have been ruled upon by trial courts have been adjudicated in favor of the cbp 
however  several matters await ruling at the trial court level or the results of plaintiff s appeal to the applicable federal appeals court 
if the cbp is ultimately unable to prevail in these matters  it might become asserted that the payments that we have received should be reduced by an undetermined amount through either smaller future distributions or as refunds to the cbp 
income before income taxes as affected by the decreased cdsoa payments  our income before income taxes for fiscal of million decreased from the fiscal total of million 
as influenced by the cessation of nondeductible goodwill amortization in fiscal as discussed below  our effective tax rate was  and in fiscals  and  respectively 
net income per common share fiscal diluted earnings per share totaled  a decrease from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was more than fiscal diluted earnings per share of 
earnings per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to no longer be amortized but reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal or other means continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
amortization of other intangibles for  and was   and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for was approximately million 
of the million in goodwill at june   approximately million related to the specialty foods segment and approximately million related to the automotive segment 
segment review specialty foods record levels of net sales were again achieved by the specialty foods segment during fiscal  but operating income of million fell from the fiscal level of million due mainly to higher raw material costs 
net sales during fiscal totaled million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
fiscal sales had increased over the fiscal total of million 
the percentage of retail customer sales was approximately during fiscal compared to and in fiscals and  respectively 
the sales growth experienced in was primarily volume driven from both retail and foodservice customers 
fiscal also benefited from the sales growth attributable to the december warren acquisition 
this acquisition provided approximately million in incremental sales during fiscal the segment s retail customer sales growth over the last two years was most influenced by the strength of the frozen bread product lines 
the level of foodservice sales during the two year period increased due to well received product development efforts for existing national account customers 
the specialty foods segment operating income in fiscal totaled million  a decrease from the fiscal total of million 
the level was above the fiscal level of million 
the decrease in fiscal s operating income was principally caused by generally higher raw material costs incurred during the year  especially for soybean oil and certain dairy related products 
the adverse impact to results of soybean oil costs alone is estimated to have exceeded million  and higher soybean oil costs are currently anticipated to continue to adversely affect comparative results through at least the first half of fiscal these soybean oil costs also impacted the year over year comparisons in ingredient costs between fiscal and  as it was estimated that the impact of the increased soybean oil costs was in excess of million in segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of candles and related accessories 
the segment s sales during fiscal totaled million  and declined compared to fiscal net sales of million 
similarly  compared to net sales in fiscal totaling million  fiscal sales declined by 
the sales decline in each year was attributable to continued weakness in both candle and glassware demand and intense competitive pressures  including pricing 
toward the end of fiscal  candle sales increased as compared to the prior year period  benefiting from the mid year introduction of a new line of private label candle products 
the segment s operating income totaled million during fiscal  a decrease from the prior year s total of million 
compared to fiscal operating income of million  fiscal income increased by 
income has been adversely affected by a less favorable sales mix  competitive pricing conditions  and lower production levels leading to less favorable levels of overhead absorption in both candle and glassware manufacturing operations 
in addition to recording a related bad debt provision of million for kmart corporation during fiscal  the segment s sales to this customer were adversely affected by the impact of the reorganization process on kmart corporation s sales 
somewhat offsetting this impact has been the income associated with the liquidations of lifo glassware inventory acquired at substantially lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as discussed previously  the million restructuring charge related to the consolidation of glass manufacturing operations also impacted fiscal results 
while the resulting reduction in glass manufacturing facilities has reduced overhead costs  the anticipated levels of manufacturing productivity of the combined operations have not yet been achieved 
we continue to assess alternative approaches to attaining satisfactory efficiencies 
we are seeing a slight upturn in the demand for candle and candle related products  but the glassware category is still exhibiting weak demand and high levels of competition 
we monitor our operations for indicators of impairment 
to the extent such indicators are present  we evaluate the long lived assets for recoverability 
see further discussion in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during fiscal totaled million  an decrease from the prior year sales level of million 
fiscal sales increased from the sales level of million achieved in fiscal fiscal sales to several original equipment manufacturers oem increased  but those gains were not large enough to offset the loss of a larger aluminum accessory oem program beginning in the first quarter of this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and indirectly through third party tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier suppliers ongoing ability to maintain their relationship with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  sales to oems comprised of this segment s sales compared to and in and  respectively 
also  consistent with the trend experienced in fiscal  aftermarket sales of floor mats continued to decline in operating income of the automotive segment totaled million for fiscal  a decrease from the prior year total of million 
this decrease was attributable to less fixed costs absorption due to the segment s reduced production levels and higher material costs 
as discussed earlier  the million restructuring charge related to the closure of the waycross  georgia location  which produced compression molded rubber floor mats  also impacted fiscal results and was meant to reduce this segment s excess capacity for floor mats 
the operating income of million was a increase over the prior year total of million 
the improvement in fiscal results above fiscal s operating income was primarily attributable to greater sales levels  a more favorable sales mix and better overhead absorption 
liquidity and capital resources the strength of our balance sheet at june  is reflected by the existence of over million in cash and equivalents  nearly million in shareholders equity  and the continued absence of debt 
we believe that this financial position provides us with substantial flexibility to consider business acquisitions  especially those that are complementary in function to that of our existing operations  evaluate share repurchase levels and otherwise meet ongoing liquidity requirements 
we maintain a revolving credit arrangement with several commercial banks totaling million 
terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
we also have an uncommitted line of credit for short term borrowings from one bank for million 
we did not have any borrowings under either arrangement in fiscal or fiscal we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facilities and an ability to obtain additional financing  combined with the current cash and cash equivalents on hand  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
our cash flows for the fiscal years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided from operating activities in fiscal totaled million  a decrease from the prior year total of million and a decrease from the fiscal total of million 
cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal were impacted by the lower level of net income and relative changes in working capital  including accounts receivable and inventory 
the june  level of accounts receivable declined from prior year levels due to the lower sales in the glassware and candles segment and a shift within accounts receivable to a greater proportion of specialty foods segment sales  as these receivables have shorter payment terms than do the sales of our two other segments 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures totaling million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital spending allocations during fiscal by segment were to specialty foods  to glassware and candles and to automotive 
expenditures in fiscal included approximately million for the expansion of a frozen roll manufacturing facility of the specialty foods segment 
based on current plans and expectations  total capital expenditures for fiscal may increase to as much as million due to the anticipated start of a new salad dressing facility  which is not expected to be completed until fiscal during fiscal  we acquired warren for a final purchase price of approximately million 
an estimated net asset adjustment of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet at june  this net asset adjustment is subject to the review by and agreement of the seller  but we do not expect any significant change to the estimated amount 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in and  payments totaling million and million  respectively  were made as required under the terms of a contingent payment arrangement associated with a business acquired in fiscal no such payment was required during fiscal  the last year of the arrangement 
financing activities used net cash totaling million  million and million in fiscals  and  respectively 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in may  our board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares of which approximately  remained authorized for future purchase as of june  in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of an additional  shares 
total dividend payments for were million  which was nearly greater than the total of million 
this increase reflects the higher dividend payout rate of 
per share present during as compared to 
per share during and 
per share in fiscal marks the st consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board of directors and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operation  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations  which are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    minimum required pension contributions other long term liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet   total     operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients  supplies  raw materials  and machinery and equipment 
this amount does not include million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the minimum pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  and deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation raw material costs during fiscal were above fiscal levels  which had increased from the levels 
among commodities most affecting this increase were soybean oil and certain dairy related products in the specialty foods segment and certain metals and petroleum derived materials used in the automotive segment 
while the costs of certain of these commodities may abate during fiscal  material costs as of june  were generally above levels of a year ago 
we generally attempt to adjust our selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments have historically been difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
minimizing the exposure to such increased costs is our diversity of operations and our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition customer sales are recognized when revenue is realized and earned 
we recognize revenue when the risk and title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products 
in addition  the number of stock keeping units may impact our allowance for obsolescence 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
the valuation during interim periods of inventories determined under the lifo method of accounting requires estimations regarding the year end mix of inventory quantities and costs of product 
such estimates may differ from the actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
these assumptions follow the guidance provided in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we  along with third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
 we elected to defer recognizing the effect of the act on the accounting for our postretirement benefit plans until authoritative accounting guidance was issued 
in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
 which provided final guidance on accounting for the act 
we will adopt the provisions of the staff position no 
in the fiscal year ended june  therefore  amounts included in the financial statements related to our postretirement benefit plans do not reflect the effects of the act 
the provisions of the act are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flow or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued revised sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
sfas no 
r revises the annual disclosure requirements for pension and postretirement plans to include additional disclosures about assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit pension and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
sfas no 
r also revises the interim disclosure requirements to include disclosures of the net periodic benefit costs for each period in which an income statement is presented and the employer s contributions paid and expected to be paid during the current fiscal year  if the contributions are significantly different than previously disclosed amounts 
the statement was effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  for interim period disclosures  the statement was effective for interim periods beginning after december  we adopted this statement for interim period disclosures with our march  form q  and we are adopting the annual disclosures with this june  form k 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations  as it pertains only to disclosure provisions 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the appropriate classification for and accounting of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that financial instruments be classified as a liability or an asset in certain circumstances if they are within the scope of the statement 
the statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the provisions of fin have been adopted and we determined that there are no variable interest entities which would require consolidation or disclosure at this time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents have been maintained only with maturities of days or less 
these financial instruments may be subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase during their limited term to maturity 
as of june   there was no long term debt outstanding
