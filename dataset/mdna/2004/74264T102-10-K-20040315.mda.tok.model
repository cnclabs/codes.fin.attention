overview we were formed in june to succeed to the business operations of companies previously acquired by bwi 
from our formation through our initial public offering  or ipo  on october   we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi  and procured a number of services from  and engaged in a number of financial and other transactions with  bwi 
after the ipo  we continued to be controlled by bwi  but operated on a stand alone basis 
on december   bwi distributed to the holders of bwi common stock on december  all of the shares of our class a common stock owned by bwi  making priority healthcare corporation a stand alone public company 
priority is a national specialty pharmacy and distributor that provides biopharmaceuticals  complex therapies and related disease treatment programs and services to individuals with chronic diseases 
priority fills individual patient prescriptions  primarily for self administered biopharmaceuticals 
these patient specific prescriptions are filled at licensed pharmacies in lake mary  florida  byfield  massachusetts  new castle  delaware  memphis  tennessee  oldsmar  florida  new york  new york  carpinteria  california and monrovia  california and are shipped directly to the patient overnight in specialized packages 
we also provide disease treatment programs for hepatitis  cancer  infertility  hemophilia  human growth hormone deficiency  rheumatoid arthritis  crohn s disease  infertility  pulmonary hypertension  pain management  multiple sclerosis  sinusitis  age related macular degeneration and others 
we also sell over  skus of specialty pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to office based physicians in oncology and other specialty markets and to outpatient renal care centers 
priority offers value added services to meet the specific needs of these markets by shipping refrigerated pharmaceuticals overnight in special packaging to maintain appropriate temperatures  offering automated order entry services and offering customized distribution for group accounts 
from distribution centers in sparks  nevada and grove city  ohio  we service over  customers in all states  including office based oncologists  renal dialysis clinics  ambulatory surgery centers and primary care physicians 
our objective is to continue to grow rapidly and enhance our market position as a leading healthcare company by capitalizing on our business strengths and pursuing the following strategy i continue to focus on further penetrating the core specialty distribution and pharmacy market  ii develop new manufacturer relationships that provide access to new products and services  iii continue to develop group purchasing organization and payor networks  iv enter new specialty markets  and v pursue acquisitions to complement existing product offerings and further penetrate markets 
over the past three years  we have continued to grow as we have executed on our growth strategy 
due to the nature of healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry  there is constant pressure on profit margins 
competition has resulted in some margin reduction on our products 
however  as we have done in the past  we expect to be able to partially offset this impact through the continuing benefits of scale  as well as cost containment measures 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the financial statements 
the items in our financial statements that we believe are the most dependent on the applications of significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers with appropriate provisions recorded for estimated discounts and contractual allowances 
discounts and contractual allowances are estimated based on historical collections from all unaffiliated customers 
any differences between our estimates and actual collections are reflected in operations in the year payment is received 
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual performance varies from our estimates 
receivables receivables are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
receivables include trade and patient account receivables and the current portion of trade receivables that have been converted to note receivables 
we regularly review and analyze the adequacy of these allowances after considering the age of each outstanding receivable and the collection history 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances are based on these analyses 
although doubtful accounts and contractual allowances have historically been within expectations and allowances established  there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
intangibles effective on december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which superseded apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
this statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill effective december  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with sfas no 
these evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on our operations  and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results 
if actual external conditions or future operating results differ from our judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we perform an annual goodwill impairment review  as defined in note  intangibles to the consolidated financial statements  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the fair value of an asset could vary  depending upon the estimating method employed  as well as assumptions made 
this may result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and or goodwill  or alternatively an acceleration in amortization expense 
an impairment charge would reduce operating income in the period it was determined that the charge was needed 
as a result of the january  impairment testing  no impairment adjustments were deemed necessary 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction 
results of operations compared to net sales 
net sales increased to billion in from billion in  an increase of 
the growth primarily reflected the addition of new customers  new product introductions  additional sales to existing customers  the acquisitions of hoss effective march  and sinus effective september  and inflationary price increases

gross profit increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in gross profit reflected increased sales and the acquisitions of hoss and sinus 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributed to contraction on gross profit related to oncology distribution products  infertility sales and margins being negatively impacted by a change in the spread between average wholesale price awp and wholesale acquisition cost wac  as published by first databank  during part of the year  and the change in sales mix  as lower margin products experienced increased sales 
competition continues to exert pressure on margins 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative  or sga  expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the increase in sga expense reflected the growth in our business  costs related to new business relationships with drug manufacturers  significant premium increases for property and liability insurance  increased costs attributable to providing more clinically oriented services and the acquisitions of hoss and sinus 
the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales resulted from spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base in management continually monitors sga expense and remains focused on controlling these increases through improved technology and efficient asset management

impairment of investment 
the impairment of investment charge of million in related to writing off our external internet investment in cytura corporation 
management considered continuing operating losses and significant changes in the technology industry to be its primary indicators of impairment 
fair market value was estimated based on valuations derived from sales of equity interests in cytura

interest income decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
in  we earned on an average invested balance of million 
in  we earned on an average invested balance of million 
the decrease in interest income was due to the lower average invested balances and lower interest rates earned  which was primarily due to the eleven short term interest rate cuts during and the one short term interest rate cut in in and  the interest income was primarily related to amounts earned by investing cash and funds received from operations  the secondary public offering of our class b common stock and stock option exercises in overnight repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and in marketable securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and represented of earnings before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund working capital needs to support internal growth  for acquisitions and for capital expenditures 
our principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
management controls inventory levels in order to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities 
we sell inventory to our customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of our major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although we monitor closely the creditworthiness of our customers  there can be no assurance that we will not incur some collection loss on accounts receivable in the future 
on january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
on february   we entered into an agreement with suntrust bank  as administrative agent  for an unsecured three year revolving credit facility for up to million 
we intend to use the available proceeds to fund acquisitions  repurchase shares of our class b common stock  provide for working capital and capital expenditures  and for other general corporate purposes 
the revolving credit facility requires us  among other things  to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  a minimum interest coverage ratio and limits our leverage ratio 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  working capital  revolving credit facility and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least one year 
net cash provided by operating activities 
our operations generated million in cash during net receivables increased million  primarily to support the increase in sales and due to the extension of credit terms to meet competitive conditions 
finished goods inventory  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily due to new product introductions  to support the increase in sales and to take advantage of some purchasing opportunities 
the million increase in accounts payable  net of acquisitions  partially reduced the cash requirements for receivables and finished goods inventory  this increase was attributable to the increase in finished goods inventory  the timing of payments and the credit terms negotiated with vendors 
other current assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  decreased cash by million  primarily due to the payment of income taxes and accrued expenses 
we anticipate that our operations may require cash to fund our growth 
net cash used by investing activities 
in  we sold million of marketable securities primarily to finance the acquisition of sinus  make an earn out payment related to the freedom drug acquisition  make an earn out payment related to the infurx acquisition  make a holdback payment related to the physicians formulary acquisition  purchase fixed assets and purchase treasury stock 
capital expenditures during totaled million 
these purchases were primarily for our new enterprise wide information technology system  computer hardware and software  telecommunications equipment  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we expect that capital expenditures during will be approximately to million 
we anticipate that these expenditures will relate primarily to our new enterprise wide information technology system  computer hardware and software  telecommunications equipment  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
in  other assets decreased million primarily due to recovering our investment in our joint venture upon its sale to advancepcs  offset by an additional deposit with a major supplier 
effective september   we acquired substantially all of the assets of sinus  the leading provider of intranasal nebulized therapies for the treatment of chronic sinusitis 
we paid million related to the acquisition of sinus 
during  we paid million related to the acquisitions of freedom drug and infurx because they achieved certain predetermined financial results during the year ended december  during  we also paid million related to a holdback on the acquisition of physicians formulary 
net cash used by financing activities 
during  we received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and we purchased treasury stock for million 
on july   the board of directors approved the purchase of up to  shares of our outstanding shares of class b common stock 
the purchases are approved through july  the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions and other considerations 
from july  to january    shares were purchased in the open market at an average price of and were included in treasury stock 
we purchased the treasury stock because management believed the stock was undervalued 
inflation our financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of our ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  we believe that our gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products we distribute 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as we receive them and therefore they reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth below under contractual obligations  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the specified contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period s omitted total beyond operating lease obligations    recent accounting pronouncements in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure was issued 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  this statement amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
as required  we adopted this statement effective in the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of a decline in the market value of our investments in marketable debt securities as a result of potential changes in interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates on securities included in our portfolio  and given the short term maturities of all of our investments in interest sensitive securities  this hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the period end carrying value
