introduction we are a global branded consumer products company with leading market positions in our two major product categories consumer batteries and electric personal care products 
we are a leading worldwide manufacturer and marketer of alkaline batteries  zinc carbon batteries  and hearing aid batteries  a leading worldwide designer and marketer of rechargeable batteries and a leading marketer of battery powered lighting products 
we are also a leading designer and marketer of electric shavers and accessories  electric grooming products and hair care appliances 
we sell our products in over countries through a variety of trade channels  including retailers  wholesalers and distributors  hearing aid professionals  industrial distributors and oems 
we enjoy strong name recognition in our markets under the rayovac  varta and remington brands  each of which has been in existence for more than years 
we have manufacturing and product development facilities located in the us  europe  china and latin america 
a significant portion of our products are manufactured by third party suppliers 
on may   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock  including all voting stock  of microlite  a brazilian battery company  from varta of germany and tabriza of brazil 
the total cash paid was approximately million  including approximately million in purchase price  approximately million of contingent consideration and approximately million of acquisition related expenditures  plus approximately million of assumed debt 
the contingent consideration will be earned by tabriza upon microlite s attainment of certain earnings targets through june  upon the calculation of the total contingent consideration due to tabriza  if any  tabriza will transfer microlite s remaining outstanding capital stock to us 
microlite operates two battery manufacturing facilities in recife  brazil and has several sales and distribution centers located throughout brazil 
the acquisition of microlite consolidates our rights to the rayovac brand in latin america 
in addition  microlite s manufacturing facilities will support our business throughout the south american region  resulting in more efficient product sourcing with lower unit costs 
subsequent to the acquisition  the financial results of microlite are reported as part of our consolidated results in our latin america segment 
microlite contributed million to our net sales  and recorded an operating loss of approximately million 
microlite s operating results reflect a period of transition and do not fully take into consideration the capital structure changes and other business changes that have occurred since the acquisition

ningbo  founded in  produces alkaline and zinc carbon batteries for retail  oem and private label customers within china 
ningbo also exports its batteries to customers in north and south america  europe and asia 
subsequent to the acquisition  the financial results of ningbo are reported as part of our consolidated results in our europe row segment 
ningbo contributed million in net sales to our results  and recorded an operating loss of approximately million 
during fiscal  we completed two major acquisitions i the acquisition of substantially all of the consumer battery business varta on october   and ii the acquisition of remington  on september  
table of contents with the acquisition of varta  we greatly enhanced our status as a global battery manufacturer and marketer and acquired additional low cost manufacturing capacity and advanced battery technology 
by expanding our product line with the acquisition of remington  we became a diversified consumer products company with a focus beyond the battery and lighting product markets 
our financial performance is influenced by a number of factors including general economic conditions  foreign exchange fluctuations  and trends in consumer markets  our overall product line mix  including sales prices and gross margins which vary by product line and geographic market  and our general competitive position  especially as impacted by our competitors promotional activities and pricing strategies 
we manage our business based upon three geographic regions 
the regions are as follows north america  which includes the united states and canada  latin america  which includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean  and europe row  which includes continental europe  the united kingdom  china  australia and all other countries in which we do business 
cost reduction initiatives we continually seek to improve our operational efficiency  match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe that we can continue to drive down our costs with continued focus on cost reduction initiatives 
fiscal in january  we announced a series of initiatives to position us for future growth opportunities and to optimize the global resources of the combined remington and rayovac companies 
as of september   all these global integration initiatives were complete  as follows remington s north american operations have been integrated into rayovac s existing business structure 
remington s european operations were consolidated into rayovac s european business unit 
remington s and rayovac s north american and european distribution facilities have been consolidated 
rayovac and remington research and development functions have been merged into a single corporate research facility in madison  wi 
in addition  a new global product innovation team has been organized and is functioning to develop future product innovations across all of our product categories 
the remington manufacturing operations in bridgeport  ct have been consolidated into rayovac s manufacturing facility in portage  wi 
all operations at remington s united kingdom and united states service centers were discontinued 
rayovac s corporate headquarters were moved to atlanta  ga 
we recorded pretax restructuring and related integration charges of million in cash costs of the integration program  including those recorded as additional acquisition costs  are expected to total approximately million 
cash savings related to these costs are projected to be approximately million when fully realized in fiscal the result of these initiatives is a reduction of approximately positions  or approximately  of the combined organization 
as a result of the integration of remington and rayovac operations  we no longer separately report profitability for remington and rayovac legacy operations 
gross profit information related to the products sold historically by each company is available and presented below in our discussions of segment profitability 

table of contents fiscal in  in conjunction with the acquisition of the varta consumer battery business  we announced a series of initiatives designed to position our consumer battery business for future growth opportunities and to optimize the combined global resources of rayovac and varta 
these initiatives provide significant benefits to the combined organization  including the renegotiation of certain sourcing arrangements  the elimination of duplicate costs in our consumer battery business and the consolidation of sales and marketing functions 
also in  we closed our mexico city  mexico zinc carbon manufacturing facility and transferred the majority of the production requirements to our guatemala manufacturing facility 
the consolidation of our zinc carbon capacity within latin america was consistent with the global market trend away from zinc carbon toward alkaline batteries  and was intended to allow us to more closely match our manufacturing capacity to anticipated market demands 
we also announced the closure of operations at our madison  wisconsin packaging center and middleton  wisconsin distribution center in these facilities were closed during fiscal and their operations were combined into a new leased complex in dixon  illinois 
transition to the new facility was completed in june we expect that all geographies will benefit from decreased costs and expenses resulting from the varta initiatives 
these initiatives are anticipated to create long term opportunities for procurement savings  resulting from renegotiated raw material and finished good sourcing arrangements  and lower operating costs as duplicative administrative support and sales and marketing functions are consolidated and overlapping functions are eliminated 
annual savings associated with all varta related initiatives are projected to be approximately million when fully realized in fiscal fiscal in fiscal  we closed our santo domingo  dominican republic manufacturing facility and transferred production of zinc carbon batteries to our guatemala city  guatemala manufacturing facility 
we also outsourced a portion of our zinc carbon battery production previously manufactured at our mexico city  mexico facility 
meeting consumer needs through technology and development we continue to focus our efforts on meeting consumer needs for portable power  personal care  and lighting products through new product development and technology innovations 
research and development efforts at remington allow us to maintain our unique manufacturing process in cutting systems for electric shavers 
remington is continuously pursuing new innovations for its line of shavers including foil improvements and new cutting and trimmer configurations 
during fiscal  remington introduced the remington titanium line of men s microscreen and microflex shavers  a line of personal grooming products that utilize titanium coated components 
during fiscal  the remington titanium line was expanded to include shavers with automatic cleaning systems 
remington also devotes resources to the development of new technologies for its other products 
during fiscal  we introduced the wet straight professional straightener 
this ceramic hair straightener dries and straightens hair in one step and includes special steam vents that release moisture to allow hair to dry as it is straightened 
we believe that our products are well poised to meet the portable power  lighting and electric personal care needs of consumers 
we will continue to focus on identifying new technologies necessary to meet consumer and retailer needs within the marketplace 
competitive landscape we primarily compete in two major product categories within the consumer products industry consumer batteries and electric personal care products 

table of contents the consumer battery industry has two major segments general and specialty 
general batteries consist of non rechargeable alkaline or zinc carbon batteries in cell sizes of aa  aaa  c  d and volt 
specialty batteries include rechargeable batteries  hearing aid batteries  photo batteries and watch calculator batteries 
most consumer batteries are marketed under one of the following brands rayovac varta  duracell  energizer or panasonic 
in addition  batteries are marketed under retailers private label brands  particularly in europe 
in north america and europe  the majority of consumers purchase alkaline batteries 
the latin america market consists primarily of zinc carbon batteries  but is slowly converting to higher priced alkaline batteries as personal income grows 
within north america and europe  the rechargeable battery business has experienced dramatic changes over the past three years

ongoing industry innovation in battery design and performance technology is also expected to help expand the size of the market 
within the hearing aid battery category  we continue to maintain a leading global market position according to management estimates 
we believe that our close relationship with hearing aid manufacturers and other customers  as well as our product performance improvements and packaging innovations  position us for continued success in this category 
we also operate in the electric personal care industry  which consists of electric shavers and accessories  electric grooming products and hair care appliances 
electric shavers include men s and women s shavers both rotary and foil design and electric shaver accessories consisting of shaver replacement parts primarily foils and cutters  preshave products and cleaning agents 
electric grooming products include beard and mustache trimmers  nose and ear trimmers and haircut kits and related accessories 
hair care appliances include hair dryers  hairsetters  curling irons  hair crimpers and straighteners and hot air brushes 
electric shavers are marketed primarily under one of the following brands remington  braun and philips norelco 
europe and north america account for the majority of the worldwide industry sales  with other major markets including japan and asia pacific 
our ability to succeed in these highly competitive product categories is influenced by the following factors strong diversified global brand portfolio 
we have a global portfolio of well recognized consumer product brands 
our rayovac and varta brand names have been used to market batteries for over years 
we use the rayovac brand name primarily in north america  latin america and the united kingdom and the varta brand name primarily in europe and selected countries in latin america

these increases were partially offset by lower non cash charges and the negative impact of changes in working capital of approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used by investing activities decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the change is primarily due to payments totaling approximately million made in associated 
table of contents with the varta and remington acquisitions 
capital expenditures were consistent with the level of spending in fiscal during  approximately million options to purchase common stock were exercised  resulting in cash proceeds to us of approximately million 
we believe our cash flow from operating activities and periodic borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet the short term and long term liquidity requirements of our existing business prior to the expiration of those credit facilities  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
our senior credit facilities include a term loan of million  the term c loan facility  a euro denominated term loan of million million at september   the euro term c loan facility  a revolving credit facility of million  the revolving credit facility  and a euro denominated revolving credit facility of million million at september   the euro revolving credit facility 
as of september   the following amounts were outstanding under these facilities million under the term c loan facility  million under the euro term c loan facility  and million under the revolving credit facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under the euro revolving credit facility 
in addition  approximately million of the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
approximately million remains available under these facilities as of september  during  we redeemed the remaining million of series b and d senior subordinated debentures assumed in connection with the acquisition of remington 
the notes were redeemed with the cash remaining following our debt offering of the million senior subordinated notes 
we also made net payments of million  which represented gross payments of million offset by borrowings of million  on the term b loan facility using a combination of cash remaining following the debt offering of the senior subordinated notes and cash generated from operating activities 
in addition  we made payments of million on the euro term a and b loan facilities using cash generated from our operating activities 
additional payments of approximately million were made in connection with other senior debt and capitalized lease obligations 
also during this period  we borrowed approximately million under our revolving credit facility primarily for the acquisitions of ningbo and microlite 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these acquisitions 
the remaining increase in indebtedness for the period of million is primarily related to debt acquired with the aforementioned acquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange effects 
in addition to principal payments  we have annual interest payment obligations of approximately million associated with our debt offering of the million senior subordinated notes due in we also incur interest on our borrowings associated with the senior credit facilities  and such interest would increase borrowings under the revolving credit facilities if cash were not otherwise available for such payments 
based on amounts currently outstanding under the senior credit facilities  and using market interest rates and foreign exchange rates in effect as of september   we estimate annual interest payments of approximately million would be required assuming no further principal payments were to occur and excluding any payments associated with outstanding interest rate swaps 
the third restated agreement  as amended  to the senior credit facilities the third agreement contains financial covenants with respect to borrowings  which include maintaining minimum interest  fixed charge ratios and maximum leverage ratios 
in accordance with the third agreement  the limits imposed by such ratios become more restrictive over time 
in addition  the third agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make investments or specified payments  give guarantees  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  and enter into a merger or acquisition or sell assets 
the terms of the million senior subordinated notes permit the holders to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes in the event of a change of control 
in addition  the terms of the notes 
table of contents restrict or limit our ability to  among other things i pay dividends or make other restricted payments  ii incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  iii create liens  iv incur dividend and other restrictions affecting subsidiaries  v enter into mergers  consolidations  or sales of all or substantially all of our assets  vi make asset sales  vii enter into transactions with affiliates  and viii issue or sell capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
payment obligations of the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries  including rov holding  inc our foreign subsidiaries  which do not guarantee the payment obligations under the notes  are directly and wholly owned by rov holding  inc  with the exception of ningbo  which is owned by us 
as of september   we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the senior credit facilities and senior subordinated notes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations other commercial commitments contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the table excludes other obligations we have reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  such as pension obligations see employee benefit obligations  note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k in millions contractual obligations payments due by fiscal year thereafter total debt debt  excluding capital lease obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations consist primarily of obligations to purchase specified quantities of raw materials and finished products

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and fairly present our financial position and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management judgment and estimates in areas that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of assets and asset impairment we evaluate certain long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections associated with such assets 
impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management when it believes that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review 
circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line  a sudden or consistent decline in the sales forecast for a product  changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used  a history of operating or cash flow losses  or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others  may trigger an impairment review 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and trade name intangibles for impairment annually 
during  we changed the annual impairment testing date for goodwill and trade name intangibles from october to august of each year 
the august date is preferable as it provides us with more time prior to the fiscal year end to complete impairment testing and to report the impact of the impairment tests in our annual form k filing 
the fair values of our goodwill and trade name intangibles exceeded the carrying amounts  and accordingly  no impairment is indicated as of august  fair values are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
these include anticipated growth rates by geographic region  the long term anticipated growth rate  estimates of the cash flows discount rate 
changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are i our projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trade name models  which management believes are reasonable growth rates for long term projections  ii our projected long term growth rate of percent for determining terminal value  and iii our discount rate of approximately percent  representing our targeted near term weighted average cost of capital wacc 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and will change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
factors inherent in determining our wacc are i the value of our common stock  ii the variability in the value of our common stock  iii our interest costs on debt and debt market conditions  and iv the amounts and relationships of debt and equity capital 
we evaluate net deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
an asset s value is deemed impaired if the earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value of the asset 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and other assumptions  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease future earnings projections and could  therefore  change the determination of whether an asset is realizable 
see note h  note i  note  note  and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about these assets 

table of contents revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer  which is the point at which all risks and rewards of ownership of the product are passed  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed reasonably assured 
we are generally not obligated to allow for  and our general policy is not to accept  product returns for battery sales 
we do accept returns related to our shaving  grooming and personal care products 
we estimate and accrue the cost of these returns based on historical experience  which are treated as a reduction of net sales 
we enter into various promotional arrangements  primarily with retail customers  including arrangements entitling such retailers to cash rebates from us based on the level of their purchases  which require us to estimate and accrue the estimated costs of the promotional programs 
these costs are generally treated as a reduction of net sales 
we also enter into promotional arrangements targeted to the consumer 
such arrangements are treated as either a reduction of net sales or an increase in cost of sales  based on the type of promotional program 
the income statement characterization of our promotional arrangements complies with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
cash consideration  or an equivalent thereto  given to a customer is generally classified as a reduction of net sales 
if we provide a customer anything other than cash  the cost of the consideration is classified as an expense and included in cost of sales 
for all types of promotional arrangements and programs  we monitor our commitments and use statistical measures and past experience to determine the amounts to be recorded for the estimate of the earned  but unpaid  promotional costs 
the terms of our customer related promotional arrangements and programs are individualized to each customer and are generally documented through written contracts  correspondence or other communications with the individual customers 
we also enter into various contractual arrangements  primarily with retail customers  which require us to make an upfront cash  or slotting payment  to secure the right to distribute through such customer 
we capitalize slotting payments  provided the payments are supported by a time or volume based contractual arrangement with the retailer  and will amortize the associated payment over the appropriate time or volume based term of the contractual arrangement 
the amortization of the slotting payment is treated as a reduction in net sales and the corresponding asset is included in deferred charges and other in our consolidated balance sheets 
our trade receivables subject us to credit risk which is evaluated based on changing economic  political  and specific customer conditions 
we assess these risks and make provisions for collectibility based on our best estimate of the risks presented and information available at the date of the financial statements 
the use of different assumptions may change the estimate of collectibility 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral 
our credit terms generally range between and days from invoice date  depending upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and history 
we monitor our customers credit and financial conditions based on changing economic conditions and adjust our credit policies with respect to any individual customer as we determine appropriate 
these adjustments may include  but are not limited to  restricting shipments to customers  reducing credit limits  shortening credit terms  requiring cash payments in advance of shipment  or securing credit insurance 
see notes b  c  and e to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our revenue recognition and credit policies 

table of contents pensions our accounting for pension benefits is primarily based on discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets  and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
in calculating the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets  for and  we used a discount rate of to and to  respectively 
in adjusting the discount rate from to  we considered the change in the general market interest rates of debt and solicited the advice of our actuary 
we believe the discount rate used is reflective of the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
in both and  we used an expected return on plan assets of to 
based on the advice of our independent actuary  we believe the expected rate of return is reflective of the long term average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
an increase in the expected return on plan assets used by us would have the effect of decreasing future pension expense 
if such expected return were overstated  it would ultimately increase future pension expense 
similarly  an understatement of the expected return would ultimately decrease future pension expense 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the markets and or interest rate declines our pension liability would increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our employee benefit plans 
restructuring and related charges restructuring liabilities are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments  and measures undertaken by management to exit certain activities 
costs for such activities are estimated by management after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment and other current or long term assets  lease termination payments  plus any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring and related charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as management executes the restructuring plan 
during fiscal  we adopted the requirements of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which impacts the timing of recognition of certain exit or disposal costs 
we report restructuring and related charges associated with manufacturing and related initiatives in cost of goods sold 
restructuring and related charges reflected in cost of goods sold include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs associated with manufacturing employees  asset impairments relating to manufacturing initiatives  and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiatives implemented 
we report restructuring and related charges associated with administrative functions in operating expenses  such as initiatives impacting sales  marketing  distribution  or other non manufacturing related functions 
restructuring and related charges reflected in operating expenses include  but are not limited to  termination and related costs  any asset impairments relating to the functional area described above  and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of recent restructuring initiatives and related costs 

table of contents loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the outcome of existing litigation and the impact of environmental matters and pending or potential examinations by various taxing authorities are examples of situations evaluated as loss contingencies 
estimating the probability and magnitude of losses is often dependent upon management s judgment of potential actions by third parties and regulators 
it is possible that changes in estimates or an increased probability of an unfavorable outcome could materially affect future results of operations 
see further discussion in item  legal proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above  are also critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in derivative financial instruments  note r of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
the general level of us interest rates  libor  and euro libor affects interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements  as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to and from our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales and purchases are made primarily in euro  pounds sterling and brazilian reals 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  intercompany loans  firm purchase commitments  accounts payable and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts  foreign exchange rate swaps and foreign exchange options 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for purchases of zinc used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks 
earnings projections are before tax 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding interest rate derivative instruments  assuming a percentage point unfavorable shift in the underlying interest rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in one year s interest expense on the related debt due to the same shift in interest rates  would be a net gain of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding foreign exchange derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying exchange rates would be immaterial 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the effect of the change in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures  would be immaterial 

table of contents as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding commodity price derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying commodity prices would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in cost of one year s purchases of the related commodities due to the same change in commodity prices  would be a net gain of million 
forward looking statements we have made or implied certain forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report  including the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business  regarding our business strategy  future operations  financial position  estimated revenues  projected costs  projected synergies  prospects  plans and objectives of management  as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties  are forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  the words anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  believe  expect  project  could  will  should  may and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words 
since these forward looking statements are based upon current expectations of future events and projections and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein  and you should not place undue reliance on these statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein include  without limitation competitive promotional activity or spending by competitors or price reductions by competitors  the loss of  or a significant reduction in  sales to a significant retail customer  difficulties or delays in the integration of operations of acquired businesses  the introduction of new product features or technological developments by competitors and or the development of new competitors or competitive brands  the effects of general economic conditions  including inflation  fluctuation in raw material and labor costs  and stock market volatility or changes in trade  monetary or fiscal policies in the countries where we do business  our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and protect our intellectual property  our ability to successfully implement  achieve and sustain manufacturing and distribution cost efficiencies and improvements  and fully realize anticipated cost savings  the impact of unusual items resulting from the implementation of new business strategies  acquisitions and divestitures or current and proposed restructuring activities  the cost and effect of unanticipated legal  tax or regulatory proceedings or new laws or regulations including environmental regulations  changes in accounting policies applicable to our business  interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations  and the effects of political or economic conditions or unrest in international markets 
some of the above mentioned factors are described in further detail in the immediately following section entitled risk factors 
you should assume the information appearing in this annual report is accurate only as of september  or as otherwise specified  as our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date 
except as required by applicable law  including the securities laws of the united states and the rules and regulations of the sec  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward looking statement 

table of contents risk factors any of the following factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the risks described below are not the only risks that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we participate in very competitive markets and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the consumer battery and electric personal care product markets in which we participate are very competitive 
in the consumer battery market  our primary competitors are duracell a brand of gillette  energizer and panasonic a brand of matsushita 
in the electric personal care products market  our primary competitors are braun a brand of gillette and norelco a brand of philips 
we and our competitors compete for consumer acceptance and limited shelf space based upon brand name recognition  perceived quality  price  performance  product packaging and design innovation  as well as creative marketing  promotion and distribution strategies 
our ability to compete in these consumer product markets may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following our primary competitors in both the battery markets and electric personal care product markets are well established companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources and greater overall market share than we do 
in some key product lines  our competitors may have lower production costs and higher profit margins than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering retail discounts and other promotional incentives 
product improvements or effective advertising campaigns by competitors may weaken consumer demand for our products 
consumer preferences may change to products other than those we market 
consolidation of retailers and our dependence on a small number of key customers for a significant percentage of our sales may negatively affect our profits 
during the past decade  retail sales of consumer products  including battery  electric shaving and lighting products  have been increasingly consolidated into a small number of regional and national mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs 
this trend towards consolidation is occurring on a worldwide basis 
as a result of this consolidation  a significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a very limited group of retailer customers 
wal mart stores  inc our largest retailer customer  alone accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal our sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders  consistent with industry practice 
because of the importance of these key customers  price or promotional demands by such customers  reductions in their purchases  change in their financial condition or loss of their accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we primarily sell branded products and a move by one of our customers to sell significant quantities of private label products which compete with products that we sell could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness 
we have  and we will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of september   we had total indebtedness of million 
our substantial indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for our business  including make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the terms of our indebtedness  
table of contents require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures and other business activities  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity or dispose of assets 
in addition  a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our cash flow 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
although the terms governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  new debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries current indebtedness levels  the related risks that we face would be magnified 
the terms of our indebtedness impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes each contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to borrow money or sell preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock  make certain types of investments  sell stock in our restricted subsidiaries  restrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  issue guarantees of debt  and sell assets or merge with other companies 
our senior credit facilities also require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including  but not limited to  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
these covenants may also restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
our ability to generate cash flow to make payments on and to refinance our debt  and to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  
table of contents such as prevailing economic  financial and competitive conditions and changes in regulations  and if such events occur  we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes and or the agreement governing our senior credit facilities 
if there were an event of default under the indenture for the notes and or the agreement governing our senior credit facilities  holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately 
additionally  if we fail to repay the debt under the senior credit facilities when it becomes due  the lenders under the senior credit facilities could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock which we have pledged to them as security 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to repay borrowings under the outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder 
we may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates  our acquisition strategy may divert the attention of management and our acquisitions may not be successfully integrated into our existing business 
we intend to pursue increased market penetration and expansion of our current product offerings through additional strategic acquisitions 
we may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and even if we do  acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms or successfully integrated into our existing business 
any acquisition we make could be of significant size and involve either domestic or international parties 
the acquisition and integration of a separate organization would divert management attention from other business activities 
this diversion  together with other difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may borrow money or issue additional stock to finance acquisitions 
such funds might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and could increase our leveraged position or be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to improve existing products and develop new  innovative products  our sales and market share may suffer 
we believe that our future success in both our battery and electric personal care product markets will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue making innovations in our existing products and to develop  manufacture and market new products 
if we fail to successfully introduce  market and manufacture new products or product innovations  our ability to maintain or grow our market share may be adversely affected  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have made and continue to make significant investments in research and development  as have our competitors 
if our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a certain market segment or otherwise outperform our products  or are perceived by consumers as doing so  we may be unable to compete successfully in market segments affected by these changes 
in the battery market  we may be unable to compete if our competitors develop or apply technology which permits them to manufacture batteries at a lower relative cost 
the fact that our principal competitors have substantially greater resources than us increases this risk 
pre emptive patent rights  restrictions on our ability to expand or modify manufacturing capacity or constraints on our research and development activity may also limit our ability to introduce products that are competitive on a performance basis 
our foreign operations may expose us to a number of risks related to conducting business in foreign countries 
our international operations and exports and imports to and from foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to economic and political destabilization  governmental corruption and civil unrest  restrictive actions by foreign governments eg  duties  quotas and restrictions on transfer of funds  changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  
table of contents changes in us and foreign laws regarding trade and investment  changes in the economic conditions in these markets  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
in many of the developing countries in which we operate  there has not been significant governmental regulation relating to the environment  occupational safety  employment practices or other business matters routinely regulated in the us as such economies develop  it is possible that new regulations may increase the expense and risk of doing business in such countries 
in addition  social legislation in many countries in which our business operates may result in significantly higher expenses associated with labor costs  terminating employees or distributors and with closing manufacturing facilities 
we may face a number of risks related to foreign currencies 
our foreign sales and certain of our expenses are transacted in foreign currencies 
with the exception of purchases of remington products  which are denominated entirely in us dollars  substantially all third party materials purchases are transacted in the currency of the local operating unit 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
significant increases in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we generally hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure  we are still vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect our sales to  purchases from and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with our customers  suppliers and creditors that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that the amount of our revenues and expenses transacted in foreign currencies will increase as our latin american  european and asian operations grow and our exposure to risks associated with foreign currencies could increase accordingly 
sales of our products are seasonal and may cause our quarterly operating results and working capital requirements to fluctuate 
sales of our products are seasonal  with a large percentage of net sales occurring during the fiscal quarter ending on or about december  due to the impact of the december holiday season 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly during the year 
in addition  orders from retailers are often made late in the year  making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult 
furthermore  adverse business or economic conditions during these quarters could materially adversely affect results of operations for the full year 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially 
for a more detailed discussion of the seasonality of our product sales  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonal product sales 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights  we rely upon a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  together with licenses  confidentiality agreements and other contractual covenants 
the measures we take to protect our technology and other intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or other intellectual property 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate or may operate in the future do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us which may negate our competitive or technological advantages in such markets 
also  some of the technology underlying our products is the subject of nonexclusive licenses from third parties 
as a result  this technology could be made available to our competitors at any time 
if this technology were licensed to a competitor  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents third party infringement claims against us could adversely affect our business 
from time to time we have been subject to claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property of others and it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product delays or require us to enter into licensing or other agreements in order to secure continued access to required technology 
licensing or other agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if claims of infringement against us are successful  they may also require us to pay significant damages or subject us to an injunction against the sale or use of our products 
in the event of a ruling against us on any such claim  a license or similar agreement may not be available to us on reasonable terms 
remington is involved in a number of legal proceedings with philips with respect to trademarks owned by philips relating to the shape of the head portion of philips three head rotary shaver 
an adverse finding against us in these or similar litigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for more information  see legal proceedings litigation 
we are dependent on a few suppliers located in asia and one of our us facilities for many of our electric personal care products 
a disruption in the supply of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our electric personal care products are manufactured by suppliers located in china and japan 
although we have long established relationships with many of these suppliers  we do not have long term contracts with them 
any adverse change in any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations relationships with our suppliers  the financial condition of our suppliers  the ability to import outsourced products  or our suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products on a timely basis 
if our relationship with one of our key suppliers is adversely affected  we may not be able to quickly or effectively replace such supplier and may not be able to retrieve tooling and molds possessed by such supplier 
in addition  we manufacture the majority of our foil cutting systems for our shaving product lines  using specially designed machines and proprietary cutting technology  at one of our facilities 
this manufacturing facility is subject to the normal hazards that could result in any material damage to any such facility 
damage to this facility  or prolonged interruption in the operations of this facility for repairs or other reasons  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell our shaving products 
our dependence on  and the price of  raw materials may adversely affect our profits 
the principal raw materials used to produce our products including zinc powder  electrolytic manganese dioxide powder and steel are sourced on a global or regional basis  and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply demand trends  transportation costs  government regulations and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  price controls  the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances 
we regularly engage in forward purchase and hedging transactions to effectively manage our raw materials costs for the next six to twelve months 
these efforts may not be effective and  if we are unable to pass on raw materials price increases to our customers  our future profitability may be materially adversely affected 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
we are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our current executive officers and we likely will depend on the senior management of any business we acquire in the future 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of these persons and the inability to attract and retain qualified replacements 

table of contents class action lawsuits  regardless of their merits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rayovac and certain of its officers and directors have been named in the past  and may be named in the future  as defendants of class action lawsuits 
regardless of their subject matter or the merits  class action lawsuits may result in significant cost to us  which may not be covered by insurance  divert the attention of management or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur material capital and other costs due to environmental liabilities 
because of the nature of our operations  our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment 
these include laws and regulations that govern discharges to the air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes  and remediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
risk of environmental liability is inherent in our business 
as a result  material environmental costs may arise in the future 
in particular  we may incur capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies 
although we believe that we are substantially in compliance with applicable environmental regulations at our facilities  we may not be in compliance with such regulations in the future  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have facilities that have been in operation by us or prior operators for decades and are constructed on fill that includes  among other things  battery materials containing various heavy metals 
from time to time  we have been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of our properties  including without limitation  the effect of the generation and disposal of wastes such as manganese  cadmium and mercury  which are or may be considered hazardous  and releases from underground storage tanks 
we have not conducted invasive testing to identify all potential environmental liability risks 
given the age of our facilities and the nature of our operations  there can be no assurance that material liabilities will not arise in the future in connection with our current or former facilities 
if previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our manufacturing facilities is discovered  we could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses 
if this occurs  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have accepted a deed restriction on one such property in lieu of conducting remedial activities  and may consider similar actions at other properties if appropriate 
although we are currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at a few of our facilities  we do not expect that such projects will cause us to incur material expenditures  however  there can be no assurance that our liability will not be material 
we have been  and in the future may be  subject to proceedings related to our disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off site disposal locations 
these proceedings are under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla or similar state laws that hold persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal 
liability under cercla is typically joint and several  meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all of the costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site 
as a practical matter  liability at cercla sites is shared by all of the viable responsible parties 
while we currently have no pending cercla or similar state matters  we may be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material 

table of contents the price of our common stock could fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over time 
we believe that factors such as quarterly operating results  changes in market conditions  securities analysts estimates of future operating results and the overall performance of the economy and the stock market  as well as the other risks affecting our business  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in the future 
broad market fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of any individual company 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price  regardless of operating results 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
anti takeover and other provisions of wisconsin law and in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
our shareholders may be liable for certain employee liabilities up to the par value of their shares 
the corporation law of the state of wisconsin and our articles of incorporation and by laws each contain certain provisions which may  in effect  discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place 
these provisions may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and could also adversely affect the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock 
in addition  in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations under provisions of wisconsin law  shareholders may be liable for unpaid wages of our employees up to the par value of their shares
