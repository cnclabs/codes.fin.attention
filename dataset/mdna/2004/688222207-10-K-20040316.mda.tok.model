during  the company experienced a reduction in net sales to its wholesale customers as well as lower net sales in our own retail stores 
both our wholesale and retail business units struggled with relatively weak product sell thru which pressured our gross profit margins 
our wholesale business was also adversely affected by reduced bookings as our customers remained cautious on their approach to managing their inventories 
significant increases in margin support to our wholesale customers along with liquidation of close out merchandise through off price channels had signficantly reduced selling prices which hurt both our net sales and gross profit margin 
we experienced a comparable store sales decrease at our outlet stores  as this distribution channel is maturing 
aggressive markdowns were needed to support our sales and to liquidate excess inventories  with a negative impact on gross margin 
we expanded our store base to stores  which added selling  general and administrative costs on a reduced level of gross margin  resulting in reduced operating income 
the company saw a significant increase in its royalties  due to initial sales of the genuine kids from oshkosh product  sold exclusively at target stores 
sales of licensed product began in july with the back to school season 
other license income from the oshkosh b gosh label both domestically and internationally was affected by the same pressures as our wholesale business  and was down from previous years 
despite the decline in operating profit  the company maintained a solid balance sheet  with no long term debt and sufficient working capital to continue to invest in the development of new business ideas  including our oshkosh company stores family lifestyle store concept 
the company increased its quarterly dividend in mid to 
per share  to return a larger portion of its income to shareholders

gross profit the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in the company s gross margin declined for several reasons 
in both our wholesale and retail businesses  the decision made in to reduce selling prices an average of ten percent implemented with our fall back to school season had a continuing impact on our margins in  particularly in the first half of the year 
the company also continued to support wholesale customers margins through negotiated support payments 
in addition  a substantial increase in the number of units sold as close outs  at substantially reduced selling prices  lowered our gross margin 
the company also recorded a charge of approximately million against cost of sales to reduce excess inventory and related spring purchase commitments resulting from the decision of a significant customer to close its children s apparel stores in early and cancel orders 
in the company s retail stores  lower customer traffic and sluggish product sell thru necessitated markdowns to effectively flow seasonal inventory through our retail stores 
the company continues to evaluate and execute its sourcing strategy to reduce the overall cost of its product offering  considering production capacity in mexico and central america  the far east and other regions of the world 
however  pressures on selling prices could not be fully offset by product cost reductions 
in addition  the company s reinvigorated design direction is to add distinguishing features to its product which frequently results in incremental product costs

seasonality of business the company s business continues to be seasonal  with highest sales and income in the second half of the year  which includes significant wholesale shipping periods and a major retail selling season at its retail stores

significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the company s annual report 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and the results of operations  require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and involve uncertainties 
the company s most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  net  inventories  accrued expenses  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management must use informed judgments and best estimates to properly apply these critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition retail store revenue is recognized at the time of sale and is net of returns 
revenue within the company s wholesale business is recognized at the time merchandise is shipped from the company s distribution centers  as this is when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
revenue is reduced by provision for returns when the return is authorized by the company 
revenue reductions related to margin support  allowances and advertising support are recorded when revenue from the related shipment of product is recognized 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns  margin support  allowances and certain advertising support 
returns the company determines the amount of potential returns of unsaleable products  and reduces sales for the full amount of the credit that is anticipated will be issued or has been issued to its wholesale customers 
margin support in the apparel industry  a supplier often faces pressure from its customers to support retail margins on the sale of the supplier s product 
the company has periodically provided allowances to its customers to assist the customer in meeting its margin expectations  and to maintain or establish long term customer relationships 
to determine the adequacy of its support  as reflected on the financial statements  the company periodically reviews potential customer support obligations for all product shipped through the date of the financial statements 
these amounts are evaluated on a customer by customer basis based on an evaluation of product sell through results  retailer performance  current market conditions  the strategic importance of the customer s ongoing business relationship and any unauthorized deductions taken by the customer 
settlements of margin support arrangements are periodically compared to the company s original estimates to enhance the compan y s ability to predict support levels in subsequent seasons 
margin support arrangements are recorded as a reduction of sales 
advertising support support for customers advertising activities  product presentation or other promotions are considered reductions of revenue unless such support relates to advertising material the company could obtain independently  which is recorded as advertising expense provided it does not exceed the fair value of such services 
the company records advertising commitments during the year as they are formalized  considering the company s prior history in dealing with customer advertising support 
accounts receivable  net in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to customers 
accounts receivable  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  is net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other allowances 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historic trends and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
the company regularly receives unauthorized charge backs from its customers for a variety of operational reasons 
the company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserve for such amounts by reviewing the historical collection of operational charge backs 
the company also considers likely charge backs that are anticipated to be taken in the foreseeable future based on historical charge back rates to properly match subsequent charge back activity with the revenue reflected in the company s financial statements 
allowances for returns of unsaleable products and margin support which reduce net sales are also reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable as they are generally settled upon payment of customer invoices 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost using the last in  first out method or market 
the company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories by season to assess slow turning  current season product as well as prior season fashion product 
this analysis is significantly influenced by customer cancellations that occur after the company has made commitments to produce its seasonal products 
due to a limited sales period for each fashion season  excess product from current and prior seasons has a diminished market value 
the company sells these units as close outs  generally at substantially reduced selling prices 
factors influencing net realizable value include desirability of the product  quantity and size range of each item available  the overall supply of close out merchandise in the off price market  recent negotiated selling prices and the seasonality of the product being sold 
the company evaluates the net realizable value of remaining inventory by season and records the inven tory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for employee health insurance  workers compensation  profit sharing  contracted advertising  professional fees and other outstanding company obligations are assessed based on statistical trends and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
income taxes the company estimates its current tax expense state and federal  and identifies temporary and permanent differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s consistent history of taxable income makes the realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets probable 
the company also periodically evaluates and has sufficiently provided for potential assessments of additional tax and interest by federal and state governmental authorities based on the ultimate settlement of current or pending audits 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation on stock options and restricted stock grants under the intrinsic value method  as permitted by apb no 
under this pronouncement  compensation expense is recorded based on the difference between the exercise price of stock options and the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant 
under the company s non qualified stock option program  the exercise price has consistently been set at the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant  resulting in no additional compensation expense 
for restricted stock grants  the company calculates compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock on date of the restricted stock grant  and amortizes this amount over the vesting period of the underlying restricted stock grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure requires proforma disclosure concerning the impact on net income had fair value accounting called for under sfas no 
been applied 
the company utilizes the black sholes method to determine the fair market value of non qualified stock option grants  and discloses all relevant assumptions inherent in this valuation model and the proforma information required under sfas no 
in a footnote to its financial statements 
the company updates the assumptions necessary to properly value stock options on the date of non qualified stock option grants or restricted stock grants 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes certain judgements and uses estimates and assumptions when applying significant accounting policies in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the development and selection of critical accounting policies and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
while there have not been any changes in the selection or application of significant accounting policies during the year  the company utilizes critical estimates and assumptions relating to the application of its provision for obsolete inventory  as described below 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value  the company estimates what portion of its seasonal inventory  including non cancelable inventory commitments  may ultimately become obsolete 
obsolete inventory is generally sold as close outs  generally at substantially reduced selling prices 
in applying this accounting principle  the company must estimate the portion of each season s inventory that may result in excess or obsolete inventory  and further must estimate the net realizable value of this inventory 
net realizable value is affected by the timing of product availability  quantities of product available  and overall market conditions including the availability of similar product 
changes in the assumptions regarding what portion of seasonal inventory will be obsolete  or the net realizable value of obsolete inventory could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
for example  if the company were to over estimate the net realizable value of its obsolete inventory by  the impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin and operating income would be approximately  while the company uses historic information and carefully analyzes current market conditions in making these estimates  it cannot be assured that the ultimate liquidation of this inventory or the actual amount of obsolete inventory that must be sold through off price channels will correspond with its estimates as of january  forward outlook the retail climate  particularly in many of the channels in which the company s products are sold  remains challenging 
the company currently projects net sales will be in the range of million to million 
the company s booked orders in dollars for the spring and summer seasons were below orders booked in dollars for the comparable season 
the company believes that this reduction is due primarily to lower unit price points  the economic pressure being placed on the company s wholesale customers for market share and the cautious approach to inventory management by many of the company s wholesale customers 
the promotional environment that exists in our wholesale business is likely to continue well into the company is currently planning comparable store sales in our retail business unit to be flat for early  gradually improving to low single digit increases over the remainder of two new retail outlet stores are expected to be opened during  and the company expects to experience incremental sales in stores opened during five under performing retail stores were closed in early the impact of these closings is immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company remains committed to its retail family lifestyle store concept 
the company intends to open family lifestyle stores during seven family lifestyle store locations are under lease  with six stores scheduled to open in the first half of the year 
the company anticipates that royalty income from domestic and international use of oshkosh b gosh and related trademarks for will be comparable with amounts 
the genuine kids licensing arrangement will generate royalty income throughout the entire year however  due to the seasonal nature of children s apparel sales  we anticipate that this royalty income will be greater in the second half of the year
