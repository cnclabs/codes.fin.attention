item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing and investing yields 
in  the company periodically utilized its credit facility to meet short term working capital needs and these borrowings were typically repaid in the near term 
the company had borrowings of million outstanding against its credit facility at december  the company did not utilize its credit facility in in  the company utilized its credit facility in connection with the acquisition of kan build and such borrowings were repaid within six months 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would primarily impact the company s long term debt 
at december   the company had million of long term debt  including current maturities 
long term debt consists mainly of industrial development revenue bonds 
in january of  the company entered into various interest rate swap agreements that became effective beginning in october of these swap agreements  which are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through november of  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
a loss of  net of taxes  attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the company had four interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of    and  respectively  that were used to convert the variable interest rates on certain industrial development revenue bonds to fixed rates 
in accordance with the terms of the swap agreements  the company pays    and interest rates  respectively  and receives the bond market association index bma  calculated on the notional amounts  with net receipts or payments being recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the company had million invested in marketable securities 
the company s marketable securities consist of public utility preferred stocks which typically pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
these financial instruments are subject to market risk in that available energy supplies and changes in available interest rates would impact the market value of the preferred stocks 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes us treasury bond futures options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of the company s investments in these fixed rate preferred stocks 
outstanding options are marked to market with market value changes recognized in current earnings 
the us treasury bond futures options generally have terms ranging from to days 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   including variable or floating rate debt and derivatives used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate preferred stocks  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
