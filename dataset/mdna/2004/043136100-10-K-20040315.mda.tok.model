overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets products based on our patented coblation technology 
our products allow surgeons to operate with increased precision and accuracy  limiting damage to surrounding tissue thereby reducing pain and speeding recovery for the patient 
our products operate at lower temperatures than traditional electrosurgical or laser surgery tools and enable surgeons to ablate  shrink  sculpt  cut  or aspirate soft tissue surgery procedures with one multi purpose surgical system 
we have organized our marketing and sales efforts based on product markets 
these business units are comprised of the following sports medicine shoulder and knee arthroscopic products  ent to include ear  nose  throat and the visage cosmetic products  arthrocare spine to include spinal and neurosurgery products and coblation technology to include gynecology  urology  laparoscopic  general surgical and cardiology products 
coblation technology is applicable across many soft tissue surgical markets 
our systems are used to perform many types of arthroscopic surgery 
our strategy includes applying our patented coblation technology to a broad range of other soft tissue markets  including spinal surgery  neurosurgery  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  general surgery  gynecology  urology and various cardiology applications 
in april  we announced that we had entered the cosmetic surgery market and formed a business unit called visage to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in early  we entered into a license and distribution agreement with collagen aesthetics  inc  which was subsequently purchased by inamed corporation 
under this agreement  inamed corporation acquired exclusive  worldwide  marketing right for our cosmetic surgery line of products for the dermatology and cosmetic surgery markets 
in march  we terminated this contract  alleging breach by inamed of certain terms of the contract 
we signed a settlement agreement with inamed mutually releasing all claims against each other in in april  we began marketing and selling our cosmetic surgery product line through a network of distributors and direct sales representatives 
in we granted exclusive distribution rights to one us distributor  and through this distributor  a network of sub distributors  to sell the visage product line  exclusive for microtouch only 
in may  we announced that we had entered the ear  nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called entec to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in early  we formed a business unit  angiocare  for the purpose of further developing and commercializing our technology in specific applications in the field of cardiology 
as part of those efforts  in february  we entered into a license agreement under which boston scientific corporation would help develop  obtain regulatory approval for and market products based on coblation technology for myocardial revascularization procedures 
in we terminated this agreement and now retain all rights to coblation technology in this field 
in september  we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market 
in february  we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery 
we are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide 
in october  we signed a merger agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of medical device alliance  inc and its majority owned subsidiary  parallax medical  inc mda  a business focused on the treatment of vertebral compression fractures 
the acquisition was consummated on january   we have received k clearance to market our arthroscopic system for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  ankle  elbow  wrist and hip  and our arthroscopy system is ce marked for use in arthroscopic surgery 
our spinal surgery system is ce marked and we have received k clearance in the united states to market this system for spinal surgery and neurosurgery 
our ent surgery system has received k clearance in the united states and is ce marked for general head  neck and oral surgical procedures  including tonsillectomy  adenoidectomy  snoring and the treatment of hypertrophic nasal turbinate and submucosal tissue channeling and shrinkage 
our cosmetic surgery system is ce marked for general dermatology and skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction procedures and we have received k clearance for use of our cosmetic surgery system in general dermatology procedures and for skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction in the united states 
we have received k clearance to market coblation technology for general surgery  gynecology and urology 
in december  we introduced our arthroscopy system commercially in the united states and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system 
our strategy includes placing controller units at substantial discounts or placing controllers at customer sites at no cost or in return for a commitment to purchase a minimum number of surgical wands  to generate future disposable product revenue 
our strategy also includes applying our patented coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets  including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery  neurosurgery  gynecology  urology  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  cardiology and general surgery 
we have received k clearance for use of our technology in several fields 
we cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
results of operations year ended december  revenues product sales royalties  fees and other total revenues cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income reclassifications on january  we implemented eitf  which relates to the consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s product and stipulates that commissions we pay to stocking distributors be reflected as a reduction of revenues in the statement of income 
fiscal amounts have been reclassified to conform to this new standard  resulting in a million decrease in revenues 
the revenue reduction was offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses  thereby having no impact on the fiscal net income 
revenues product sales consist of sales of controller units and disposable devices 
product sales for were million  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
product sales by product market for the periods shown were as follows year ended december  atlantech other sports medicine total sports medicine ent arthrocare spine coblation technology total product sales product sales by geography for the periods shown were as follows year ended december  united states international total product sales several years ago  we began aggressively transitioning our distribution channel away from stocking distributors to a more direct sales model 
the execution of this strategy was substantially complete by the end of in connection with this strategy  we recorded million in revenue reduction adjustments and charges in due to termination of stocking distributor agreements 
the increase in direct sales presence had a positive effect on product sales in both and  as did the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through continued promotional programs of controller placements  commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy and introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform 
additionally  our improved presence in europe and our acquisitions of the atlantech distributors and product line have added to our product sales growth 
we generally sell our controller units at substantial discounts to generate demand for our disposable devices 
we generally sell our disposable devices at or near list price  except for sales to international distributors and marketing partners  which are sold at discounted prices 
we expect these discounts to continue in the future 
for fiscal years   and  disposable device sales comprised approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales 
we anticipate that disposable device sales will remain the primary component of our product sales in the near future 
we shipped approximately  disposable devices in  compared to approximately  and  devices in and  respectively 
based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year  we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market  while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment 
to achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time  we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures  expand physicians education with respect to coblation technology  and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications 
we believe that  in our seven years of product shipments  we have penetrated to of the hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states 
we believe that approximately of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures 
we expect our sales to continue to be strong in  as we continue to increase our presence in europe and add the mda product line to our sales mix 
royalties  fees  and other revenues consist mainly of revenue from the licensing of our products and technology 
royalties  fees  and other revenues increased to million in from million in royalties  fees  and other revenues decreased in from million for fiscal  primarily due to the cancellation of agreements in with distribution partners resulting in recognition of million in fees that previously had been deferred 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consists of manufacturing costs  material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs 
additionally  cost of product sales includes amortization of controller unit placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of controller units shipped to customers  with the costs being capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the useful life of the controller unit 
cost of product sales for was million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales for and million  or of product sales  for fiscal gross product margin as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in both and the increase in gross margin percentage compared to was mainly attributable to the increased efficiency of our manufacturing operations resulting mostly from the transition of manufacturing operations to our costa rica facility and increased production volume to cover our increased product sales  partially offset by the increased controller unit amortization and the lower gross margin on sales of atlantech products 
the decrease in gross product margin in compared to was mainly attributable to increased average selling prices of disposable devices  increased manufacturing efficiency due to a half year of manufacturing at our costa rica facility and increased production volume  offset by increased controller unit amortization and the first of our atlantech sales 
the gross product margin was additionally impacted by a million charge to revalue inventory to bring it into line with our new  lower manufacturing cost structure and a million charge relating to purchase price adjustments to inventory due to our acquisition of atlantech 
we expect gross product margins to continue at around levels as we continue to experience savings from our costa rica manufacturing facility 
operating expenses research and development expense increased to million  or of total revenues  in from million  or of total revenues  in and from million  or of total revenues  in the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our continued investment in coblation technology  which we believe is essential for us to maintain and improve our competitive position 
the increase consists of million in increased compensation and related expenses due to increasing headcount  and million in increased prototype development costs 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to increased compensation and related expenses of million due to increasing headcount  and increased development prototype materials expense of million  and million in increased facility and information system costs in conjunction with expanding our infrastructure 
we believe that investment in our coblation technology is essential for us to maintain our competitive position 
we expect to increase the dollar amount of research and development expenses through continued expenditures on new product development  including for the newly acquired mda products  regulatory affairs  clinical studies and patents  with expenses as a percentage of product sales to remain essentially flat 
sales and marketing expense increased to million  or of total revenues  in from million  or of total revenues  in  and from million  or of total revenues  in increased expenses in as compared to related primarily to million in increased sales commissions associated with the increased sales volume  million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force  especially in europe  and million in amortization of intangible assets due to the purchase of our atlantech distributors 
increased expenses in as compared to related primarily to increased commission expenses of million as a result of increased sales  a million increase in sales and marketing activity in our businesses other than arthroscopy and our expanded international operations  million in additional compensation and related expenses 
we anticipate that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the expansion of our distribution capabilities to address the spinal surgery and ear  nose and throat markets  higher dealer commissions from increased sales  the additional cost of penetrating international markets  higher promotional  demonstration and sample expenses  and additional investments in the sales  marketing and support staff necessary to market products and to commercialize future products 
further absolute dollar increases in sales and marketing expenses are expected to be driven by increased sales volumes from the mda product line 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of total revenues in from million  or of total revenues  in  and from million  or of product sales  in the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to is due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related expenses due to increased staffing in the united states and international locations and a million increase in legal costs due to the expenses involved in patent infringement litigation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in staffing and salaries  a million increase in the cost of general and patent related legal services and approximately million increase due to business development activities  insurance and other expenditures necessary to expand our corporate infrastructure 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of product sales  but will increase in dollar amounts as we incur additional legal expenses and continue business development activities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in and from million in the decrease in interest and other income  net  in is primarily due to lower interest income due to lower average cash balances  partially offset by increased foreign exchange gains due to the strong european currencies in the decrease in interest and other income in was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of a decrease in the amount of cash and investment balance resulting from our investing and financing activities  declining interest rates throughout  and a million gain on the sale of an investment in fiscal as opposed to a gain of million in due to the use of cash and borrowings in our purchase of mda in january  we anticipate interest and other income to decrease in the future 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million for  compared to million for and million for the effective tax rate for was  compared to in and in the improvement in effective tax rate is primarily due to management s belief that deferred tax assets recorded in prior years are more likely to be realized given the company s continuing history of net profits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in working capital  compared to million at december  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term available for sale securities 
cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
cash generated by operating activities was million in  mainly attributable to net income  adjusted for non cash items  of million  partially offset by an increased investment in inventory  necessary for our increased sales volume  and a buildup of accounts receivable and other assets  also precipitated by our increased sales volume and operating activity 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in inventory was in order to support anticipated increasing product sales activity 
we expect future inventory levels to increase in absolute dollar value in order to support sales volume increases  to provide safety stock and support our expansion into additional markets 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in accounts receivable in was due to significant increase in sales  slightly offset by an improvement in average collection times 
cash used in investing activities was million in  due mainly to an investment in fixed and intangible assets of million  partially offset by million in net maturities of available for sale securities 
investments in property and equipment increased to million for compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the capitalization of controllers placed under various promotional programs  in addition to normal increases in equipment 
cash used in financing activities was million for  due to million in purchases of treasury stock under the company s stock purchase plan  partially offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of common stock options 
the increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants from is primarily driven by our higher stock price in the last quarter of  which led to increased exercises of options and warrants 
in the past  we have financed our operating and capital needs principally with cash from product sales  cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities and related interest  and existing capital resources 
however  in october  we announced our intent to acquire medical device alliance inc  an acquisition which was completed on january   pursuant to which we were to make an initial cash payment of approximately million in cash  net of certain holdbacks  which used a significant portion of our cash reserves 
in anticipation of the cash needs for this acquisition  we entered into a million revolving credit facility and a million term credit facility with banc of america securities and wells fargo bank as co loaners 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to million at the bank of america prime rate plus to or at libor plus to at our discretion for operating needs 
the increase over the base rate is determined by our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
under the terms of the term credit facility  we may borrow million for specified acquisitions at the same rates as noted above 
the credit facility contains covenants which specify minimum financial ratios and limit our ability to take on additional debt  or make future acquisitions or dispositions 
on january   in connection with the acquisition of medical device alliance inc  we borrowed million under the term credit facility at an interest rate of which will become due on june  we believe that the above described credit and term facilities  in addition to cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations through fiscal year and in the near future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our success in commercializing our products  development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all material contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect our financial condition and liquidity as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations contractual obligations to former atlantech owners total in connection with the acquisition of medical device alliance inc  which was consummated on january   we borrowed million under our term credit facility 
this amount will become due in june the total purchase price was million  net of certain holdbacks of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory allowances  warranty costs  goodwill impairments  contingencies and other special charges  and taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product and royalty revenue upon shipment of our products to customers  upon fulfillment of acceptance terms  if any  when no significant contractual obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is reported net of a provision for estimated product returns 
revenue related to collaborative research and development contracts is recognized as the related work is performed 
we recognize license fee and milestone revenue from business partners over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee or milestone is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling costs are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues and related costs are classified as cost of product sales 
inventory allowance inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
we record an allowance against our inventory value to the extent be believe that demand for certain inventory items has decreased or if certain inventory items have become obsolete 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than the expectations on which the accrual had been based  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
goodwill impairment we currently have recorded goodwill related to our purchase of our atlantech european distributors 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
impairment is measured by the difference between the recorded value of goodwill and its implied fair value when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally one to five years 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the amount accrued is net of any recuperation of costs or insurance recovery 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting 
under this method  employee stock based compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of the company s stock and the exercise price of the award 
we account for stock options issued to non employees using the fair value method of accounting  which requires us to assign a value to the stock options issued based on the black scholes pricing model and to record that value as a compensation expense 
if we were to account for stock options issued to employees using the fair value method of accounting rather than the intrinsic value method  our results of operations would be significantly affected 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance could be accounted for as equity  be classified as liabilities in the statement of financial position 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our results of operations or cash flows for our cash and cash equivalents and our short term investments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term available for sale securities average interest rate although payments under the operating leases for our facility are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with operating leases 
borrowings under our credit facility are dependant on current market interest rates 
to the extent that these rates fluctuate  our ability to borrow needed capital at a critical time could be significantly affected 
a significant portion of our european sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  most of these currencies grew stronger against the us dollar 
to the extent that these currencies continue to become stronger or become weaker against the us dollar  we will experience variations in our results of operation and financial condition
