item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of radio stations and our acquisition of other media businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under item for additional information 
overview as a radio broadcasting company with a national radio network  we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the number of stations in the market as well as the number of stations in the market in our format that are competing for the same listeners  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
our sources of revenue and product offerings also include other media businesses  including internet businesses and publishing 
the following table shows gross broadcasting revenue  the percentage of gross broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source and net broadcasting revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials salem radio network other gross broadcasting revenue less agency commissions net broadcasting revenue our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
historically we have not subscribed to traditional audience measuring services 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audience 
in selected markets we subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our network have a general pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds generally with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually 
our cash flow is affected by a transition period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial or advisable to change its format 
this transition period is when we develop a radio station s customer and listener base 
during this period  a station will typically generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include employee salaries and commissions  facility expenses such as rent and utilities  promotional expenses and music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network  our internet business  earns its revenue from sales of streaming services  sales of banner advertising and sponsorships on the internet  and  to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
salem publishing also referred to as ccm  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as other media on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
with regard to fiscal quarters  we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the quarter  as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year 
same station results for a full year are based on the sum of the same station results for the four quarters of that year 
results of operations we have reclassified our statements of operations data for all periods presented to reflect our sale on september   of the assets of radio station wygy fm  which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in addition  we have reclassified barter transactions to reflect increases to revenues and expenses as appropriate  eliminating the practice of reporting the net contribution of these transactions in our statements of operations 
the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated net broadcasting revenue other media revenue total revenue broadcasting operating expenses cost of denied tower site and license upgrade other media operating expenses legal settlement corporate expenses cost of terminated offering depreciation and amortization operating income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net broadcasting revenue

other media operating expenses increased million or to million in from million in the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in selling and editorial costs associated with the integration of our internet portal crosswalk

revenue from advertising as a percentage of our gross broadcasting revenue increased to in from in revenue from block programming time as a percentage of our gross broadcasting revenue decreased to in from in this change in our revenue mix was primarily due to the launch of our contemporary christian music format in several of our markets and our continued efforts to develop more advertising revenue in all of our markets

as a result of this settlement  we recorded a one time charge of approximately million in the second quarter of corporate expenses 
corporate expenses increased million or to million in from million in  primarily due to a additional overhead costs incurred for all of as compared to a portion of in connection with the acquisitions of radio stations and an internet business during and b additional overhead costs associated with the acquisitions of radio stations during  partially offset by a reduction in senior management bonuses in depreciation and amortization

income from discontinued operations was million net of income tax expense of million in  compared to a loss of million net of a tax benefit of million in discontinued operations relate to the operations of wygy fm  cincinnati  ohio  which was sold on september  for million 
the increase in income from discontinued operations was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the assets of the radio station of million net of income tax expense of million during net income 
as the above discussion reflects in further detail  we recognized net income of million in as compared to net income of million in non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate station operating income 
we define station operating income as net broadcasting revenue less broadcasting operating expenses 
station operating income is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that station operating income is useful  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and by analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  we use station operating income as one of our key measures of operating efficiency and profitability 
station operating income does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our station operating income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  station operating income 
station operating income increased million or to million in from million in as a percentage of net broadcasting revenue  station operating income increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to the effect of radio stations acquired during and that previously operated with formats other than their current format and the effect of the growth of our contemporary christian music format 
acquired and reformatted radio stations typically produce low margins during the first few years following conversion 
station operating income margins improve as we implement scheduled program rate increases and increase advertising revenue on our stations

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and long term debt and debt covenant compliance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies  which affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets most of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is generally our policy to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or other media businesses under consideration for acquisition 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or other media business at the close of the transaction 
when we exchange assets  we consider whether the exchange is an exchange of a business or otherwise requires the assets received to be recorded at fair value with the recognition of a gain or loss on the transaction  or the exchange is an exchange of similar productive assets that should be recorded on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recorded 
in accordance with purchase accounting methodology  the operating results of the acquired assets and businesses are included in the consolidated operating results since the dates of acquisition 
from time to time we undertake projects to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs up to the point where the project is complete  at which point we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
in certain cases where a project s completion is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the unlikely event the required approval is considered not probable  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
as of december   there are two significant upgrade projects with an aggregate amount of million which is included in other assets  in addition to several other projects aggregating an insignificant amount 
allowance for bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and performing other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets under the financial accounting standards board s rules  sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  but perform annual impairment tests in accordance with these statements 
we believe our fcc licenses have indefinite lives under the new standard and accordingly amortization expense will no longer be recorded for our fcc licenses as well as our goodwill effective july   for assets acquired subsequent to june   and effective january   for all other assets 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we perform an annual test of impairment on our fcc licenses and our goodwill 
these tests include comparing the recorded values to the appraised values  calculations of discounted cash flows  operating income and other analyses 
as of december   based on our application of the impairment rules  no impairment was recorded 
the assessment of the fair values of these assets and the underlying businesses are estimates which require careful consideration and judgements by our management 
if conditions in the markets in which that our stations and other media businesses operate or if the operating results of our stations and other media businesses change or fail to develop as anticipated  our estimates of the fair values may change in the future and result in impairment charges 
valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine the realizability of the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of our borrowings under our credit facility as long term debt in our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the borrowing restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments will be required pursuant to the credit agreement 
these projections are estimates which are inherantly uncertain and dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors  our actual results could differ from these estimates 
should our actual results differ materially from these estimates  payments may become due under our credit facility or it may become necessary to seek an amendment to our credit facility 
based on our management s current assessment  we do not anticipate principal payments becoming due under our credit facility or a further amendment of our credit facility becoming necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
in addition  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we adopted this statement in the first quarter which resulted in the write off of deferred financing costs and termination fees related to the repayment of debt being reclassified from extraordinary loss to loss on early retirement of debt included in other income and expense for all periods presented 
fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to january   the provisions of fin were originally effective as of the beginning of the three months ended september   however  the fasb subsequently delayed the effective date of this provision until the first interim or annual period ending after december  the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  salem is currently performing a review of its investments in both non marketable and marketable securities as well as other arrangements to determine whether the investee or other party is a vie and then whether salem is the primary beneficiary of any of the related entities 
the review has not identified any vie that would require consolidation as of the year ended december  salem expects to complete the review during the first quarter of provided that salem is not the primary beneficiary  the maximum exposure to losses related to any entity that may be determined to be a vie is generally limited to the carrying amount of the investment in the entity 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand  borrowings under the credit facility and operating cash flow 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations  fund acquisitions and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
cash 
cash and cash equivalents was million on december  working capital was million on december  cash and cash equivalents was million on december  working capital was million on december  additionally  on december   we had million classified as restricted cash  which was held in a trust account that was used to redeem on january   all of our outstanding million senior subordinated notes due plus accrued interest  and million held by a qualified intermediary under a like kind exchange agreement to preserve our ability to effect a tax deferred exchange 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to million used to acquire the assets of seven radio stations during and payments of million against our credit facilities  offset by borrowings of million from our credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in station operating income  an increase in deferred revenue from a long term operating lease  an increase in accounts receivable turnover and a decrease in deferred income taxes 
net cash used by investing activities increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase is due to cash used for acquisitions cash used of million to purchase the assets of seven radio stations during as compared to cash used of million to purchase the assets of five radio stations and the assets of an internet business during offset by a decrease in capital expenditures and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of radio station assets no radio station assests were sold in as compared to approximately million received from the sale of radio station wygy fm  cincinnati  ohio  in 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the difference was primarily due to increased repayments under our credit facility of million in as compared to million in  partially offset by additional borrowings of million under the credit facility in as compared to million in credit facility 
our wholly owned subsidiary  salem communications holding corporation holdco  is the borrower under our credit facility 
the credit facility was amended and restated as of september   and includes a million senior secured reducing revolving credit facility our credit facility as well as a million term loan facility term loan

at december   the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facilities was 
if an event of default occurs  the rate may increase by 
the maximum amount that holdco may borrow under our credit facilities is limited by a ratio of our consolidated existing total adjusted funded debt to pro forma twelve month cash flow the total leverage ratio 
our credit facilities will allow us to adjust our total debt as used in such calculation by the lesser of i of the aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of newly acquired non religious formatted radio stations that we reformat to a religious talk  conservative talk or religious music format or ii million  and the cash flow from such stations will not be considered in the calculation of the ratio during the period in which such acquisition gives rise to an adjustment to total debt 
the total leverage ratio allowed under the credit facilities was to as of december  thereafter  the maximum ratio will decline periodically until december   at which point it will remain at to through march the total leverage ratio under our credit facilities at december   on a pro forma basis  was to  resulting in a borrowing availability of approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
we actively monitor these fluctuations and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments only for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction  or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management 
our use of derivative instruments may result in short term gains or losses and may increase volatility in our earnings 
at december   an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million was outstanding 
the interest rate swap agreement is used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of a portion of our notes that may result due to changes in interest rates 
this agreement expires in when the notes mature  and effectively swaps the fixed interest rate on million of our debt for a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement and the change in fair value of the debt hedged by the swap  based on current market rates  were each million at december  the fair value of the swap agreement is included with long term assets  and the fair value of the debt hedged by the swap is recorded in long term debt consistent with the maturity date of the swap and related debt 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged are recorded as part of interest expense 
because this fair value hedge is effective that is  the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument is designed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the item being hedged  there was no income statement effect relative to the change in the fair value of the swap agreement 
interest expense for the year ended december   was reduced by million as a result of the difference between the fixed interest rate on our debt and the floating interest rate under the swap agreement  which was for the six month period ended june   and for the six month period ended december  the counter party to this interest rate swap agreement is a major financial institution 
although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party 
on july   we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million 
this agreement also relates to our notes 
this agreement expires in when the notes mature  and effectively swaps the fixed interest rate on million of the notes for a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the estimated negative fair value of this swap agreement and the excess of book value over the change in fair value of the debt hedged by the swap  based on current market rates  were each million at december  changes in the fair value of the swap and the changes in the fair value of debt being hedged are recorded as part of interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreement is included with long term liabilities  and the fair value of the debt hedged by the swap is recorded in long term debt consistent with the maturity date of the swap and related debt 
because this fair value hedge is effective that is  the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument is designed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the item being hedged  there was no income statement effect relative to the change in the fair value of the swap agreement 
interest expense for the year ended december   was reduced by million as a result of the difference between the fixed interest rate on our debt and the floating interest rate under the swap agreement  which was from inception through december  under sfas no 
 as amended  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument at each new measurement date is dependent upon its intended use 
the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment  referred to as a fair value hedge  is recognized as gain or loss in earnings in the period of the change together with an offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the differential paid or received on the interest rate swap is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires all derivative instruments to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities 
in addition  all derivative instruments used in hedging transactions must be designated  reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended 
market risk in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above under derivative instruments  borrowings under the credit facility are subject to market risk exposure  specifically to changes in libor and in the prime rate in the united states 
at december   we had borrowed million under our credit facility 
as of december   we could borrow up to an additional million under the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under our credit facility bear interest at a base rate  at our option  of the banks prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the revolving credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
for the term loan portion of our credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
in each case  the spread is based on the total leverage ratio on the date of determination 
at december   the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facility was 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in the prime rate or libor  as applicable  would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis 
in addition to the variable rate debt disclosed above  we have fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million as of december   with an aggregate fair value of million 
we are exposed to changes in the fair value of these financial instruments based on changes in the market rate of interest on this debt 
the ultimate value of these notes will be determined by actual market prices  as all of these notes are tradeable 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair value of the notes to approximately million and a hypothetical basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in the increase of the fair value of the notes to approximately million
