critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
table of contents revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
the company believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include its allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation and accounting for goodwill 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains valuation allowances based upon the expected collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on many factors such as industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables and changes in customer payment patterns 
at december   the company had accounts and notes receivable of million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on net income 
the company actively manages its accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
inventory valuation 
in order to state inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market  the company maintains an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory based upon the expectation that some inventory will become obsolete and be sold for less than cost or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as age of the inventory and historical trends 
at december   the company had inventory of million  net of an allowance of million 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer could result in unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin  and net income 
the company actively manages its inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and has consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas state that goodwill should not be amortized but should be tested for impairment upon adoption of the standard and  at least annually  at the reporting unit level 
as a result  the company no longer records goodwill amortization expense 
the company performs an impairment test of its goodwill based on its reporting units as defined in sfas on an annual basis 
in performing the impairment test  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which can include multiples of the units earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  present value of expected cash flows and quoted market prices 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current market capitalizations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value to determine potential impairment 
the company s goodwill totaled million at december  the impairment review required by sfas requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
the application of alternative assumptions  such as a change in discount rates or ebitda multiples  or the testing for impairment at a different level of organization or on a different organization structure  could produce materially different results 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than 
table of contents voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies as of march  management does not expect application of this interpretation to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
customer risk the company is subject to risks associated with changes in the healthcare industry  including competition and continued efforts to control costs  which place pressure on operating earnings  changes in the way medical and surgical services are delivered  and changes in manufacturer preferences between the sale of product directly to hospital customers and the use of wholesale distribution 
the loss of one of the company s larger customers could have a significant effect on its business
