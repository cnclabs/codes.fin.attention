overview we serve an active customer base of over  dentists through dental laboratories located in states 
our business consists of a single industry segment  which is the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
product offerings include restorative products that are permanently affixed by a dentist to a patients existing dental anatomy  including traditional porcelain fused to metal crowns and bridges and dental implants 
reconstructive products that are removable prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures  including partial and full dentures 
cosmetic products that consist primarily of porcelain veneers designed to enhance the appearance of the front of a tooth as well as all ceramic crowns that are made without a traditional metal substructure and more closely replicates the appearance of natural teeth 
this category also includes composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
internal revenue growth has been relatively flat over the past three years 
early in  we made note that the economic climate appeared to be impacting the dental laboratory industry 
in  we began to believe that many patients and dentists were postponing optimal treatment plans  such as crowns  and pursuing less expensive alternatives such as amalgam fillings  for which we recognize no revenue 
as a result  sales of restorative products were unfavorably impacted 
we believe that while a portion of this segment can be temporarily deferred by patients  the work will eventually be required and will be done 
during  the economic situation was much like that in  although we have seen some recent favorable signs in the marketplace that industry growth may be returning to more positive trends 
we have also continued to pursue an acquisition strategy  which has played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in however  operating margins as measured as a percentage of sales declined over this period 
the main cost drivers for us are the cost of labor and related employee benefits 
competition for labor resources and increases in medical insurance costs drive these costs higher 
these increased costs combined with flat internal sales growth have contributed to lower operating margins 
during  we reviewed and adjusted staffing levels at each of our locations to minimize the costs of the slowdown in sales growth 
we have been cautious about labor reductions due to the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce in anticipation of future sales growth 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we first developed and subsequently continued to invest in the ndx reliance program tm  a national marketing and branding campaign that we believe holds long term value and will help us attain our sales objectives 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital decreased from  at december  to  at december  cash and equivalents decreased  from  at december  to  at december  operating activities provided  in cash flow for the year ended december  existing cash and cash equivalents along with cash flows from operating activities were sufficient to cover cash used in investing activities 
cash outflows related to dental laboratory acquisitions totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of acquisition activity in compared to during  we acquired approximately  in assets compared to  in capital expenditures for were  compared to  in during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock from treasury stock as directors fees at a total cost of  we maintain a stock repurchase program and may repurchase stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares as of december  we maintain a financing agreement the agreement with citizens bank of massachusetts the bank 
the agreement  as amended and extended on december   includes revolving lines of credit of  and  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit is the prime rate minus or the london interbank offered rate libor plus  at our option 
both revolving lines of credit mature on june  we are currently evaluating competitive proposals to both increase and extend our current credit facilities 
we expect to finalize new agreements in april and do not anticipate any difficulties in concluding new lending arrangements 
a commitment fee of one eighth of is payable on the unused amount of both lines of credit 
at december   the full principal amount was available to us under both revolving lines of credit 
the agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth and other financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our management believes that cash flow from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet contemplated operating and capital requirements  including costs associated with anticipated acquisitions  if any and deferred payments associated with prior acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than greater than total year years years years operating leases real estate vehicles equipment laboratory purchase obligations contingent laboratory purchase price total 
table of contents laboratory purchase obligations totaling  classified as deferred acquisition costs are presented in the liability section of the balance sheet 
contingent laboratory purchase price includes amounts subject to acquisition agreements that are tied to earnings performance  as defined  over a three year period 
as payments become determinable  they are recorded as goodwill 
we are committed under various non cancelable operating lease agreements covering our office space and dental laboratory facilities  vehicles and certain equipment 
certain of these leases also require us to pay maintenance  repairs  insurance and related taxes 
as sponsor of the national dentex corporation dollars plus plan  the plan  a qualified plan under section a of the internal revenue code  we are preparing to file a retroactive plan amendment under the internal revenue service s voluntary correction program to clarify the definition of compensation in the plan 
based on our consultation with our erisa counsel  we believe this issue will be favorably resolved without requiring additional employer contributions or jeopardizing the tax qualified status of the plan

increases in labor and related expenses were partially offset by decreases in materials costs 
our labor reduction program instituted during the second half of the year helped to mitigate labor costs  although health care costs continued to increase 
during the fourth quarter  we revised our health insurance plan in an attempt to control these increasing medical costs by implementing design changes and cost sharing with employees 
the decrease in material cost as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the continued implementation of various pricing strategies along with new supplier purchasing agreements

other marketing costs were reduced from  in to  in in addition  commission expense decreased by approximately  in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of an ongoing restructuring of our sales force and related compensation plans that we expect will improve internal sales growth over the long term

the effective tax rate for fiscal year decreased to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to non deductible expenses  primarily goodwill amortization  constituting a smaller portion of taxable income as a result of the elimination of such amortization due to the adoption of fas on january  net income as a result of all the factors discussed above  net income decreased to  or per share on a diluted basis in from  or per share on a diluted basis in critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
as released by the securities and exchange commission requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
while the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period  we do not believe our financial statements are significantly affected by complex accounting policies and methods 
a summary of certain of our significant accounting policies is presented below 

table of contents summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized as the dentists orders are shipped 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized upon shipment 
shipping and handling costs totaling approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
inventories inventories  consisting principally of raw materials  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we use estimates based on specific identification to maintain proper reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
additionally  we estimate work in process inventories by applying current labor  materials and selected overhead expense rates to standard production schedules 
finally  we estimate the value of unrefined precious metal scrap based on the application of various return and refining statistics 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated depreciable lives buildings years furniture and fixtures years laboratory equipment years computer equipment years leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives or the lease terms 
gains and losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation expense totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets at each balance sheet date  our management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  using certain financial indicators  such as historical and future ability to generate income from operations 
our policy is to record an impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination is based on an evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant event  a significant change in the environment in which the business operates or if the expected future undiscounted cash flows become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
we believe that no impairment of long lived assets existed as of december  and other assets included in other assets are the costs of noncompetition agreements  which are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis according to the terms of the agreements over to years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill amortization ceased on december  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the value of goodwill has been impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis  based on a two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit 
table of contents to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step would be to record an impairment loss to the extent of that difference 
the company determines fair value using factors based on revenue and operating margins 
as of december   there has been no impairment of goodwill 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
the amount of deferred tax asset or liability is based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse

the amended disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and we have adopted the amended disclosure provisions at december  we have not decided whether or not we will voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation at this time 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no

fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin  as revised in december  must be applied at the end of periods ending after march   and is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  our management does not believe that the adoption of the revised fin will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
