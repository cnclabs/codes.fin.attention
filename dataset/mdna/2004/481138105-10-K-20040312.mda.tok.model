item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
general the company s principal business is publishing newspapers in the united states  and its publications are primarily daily and non daily newspapers and similar publications 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from advertising  paid circulation and commercial printing 
as of december   the company owned and operated daily newspapers and non daily publications strategically clustered in six geographic areas greater philadelphia  connecticut  greater cleveland  central new england  and the capital saratoga and mid hudson regions of new york 
as of december   the company had total paid daily circulation of approximately  total paid sunday circulation of approximately  and total non daily distribution of approximately million 
the principal elements of the company s strategy are to i expand advertising revenues and readership  ii grow by acquisition  iii capture synergies from geographic clustering  and iv implement consistent operating policies and standards 
as part of the company s strategy  the company focuses on increasing advertising and circulation revenues and expanding readership at its existing and newly acquired properties 
the company has also developed certain operating policies and standards that it believes have resulted in significant improvements in the cash flow and profitability of its existing and acquired newspapers  including i focusing on local content  ii maintaining and improving product quality  iii enhancing distribution  and iv promoting community involvement 
the company is a leader in the newspaper industry in executing a clustering strategy 
the company believes that its clustering strategy creates significant synergies and cost savings within each cluster  including cross selling of advertising  centralized news gathering and consolidation of printing  production and back office activities 
the company also believes that its clustering strategy enables it to improve print quality and distribution  introduce new products and services in a cost effective manner and increase readership 
in addition  clustering enables the company s advertisers to expand their reach and target their message both geographically and demographically 
the company s revenues are derived from advertising percent of fiscal year revenues  paid circulation percent of fiscal year revenues  including single copy sales and subscription sales  and commercial printing and other activities percent of fiscal year revenues 
advertising revenues are comprised of three basic categories retail approximately percent of fiscal year advertising revenues  classified approximately percent of fiscal year advertising revenues and national approximately percent of fiscal year advertising revenues 
the company s advertiser base is predominantly local 
the company s newspapers seek to produce desirable results for local advertisers by targeting readers based on certain geographic and demographic characteristics 
the company seeks to increase readership  and thereby generate traffic for its advertisers  by focusing on high product quality  compelling and often proprietary local content and creative and interactive promotions 
the company s advertising revenues for fiscal year were derived primarily from a broad group of local advertisers 
no single advertiser accounted for more than one percent of the company s total fiscal year revenues 
the company s management believes that its advertising revenues tend to be relatively stable because its newspapers rely on a broad base of local retail and local classified advertising  rather than the generally more volatile national and major account advertising 
however  the company s advertising revenues are susceptible to economic swings  particularly those that affect the local economies in the markets in which the company operates  and can be difficult to predict 
in addition  the company is committed to expanding its business through its internet initiatives 
online revenues are included in advertising revenues and constituted approximately percent of total advertising revenues in fiscal year the company s online objective is to make its websites  all of which are accessible through www 
journalregister 
com  the indispensable source of useful and reliable community news  sports and information in their markets by making the websites the local information portal for their respective markets 
the company currently operates websites  which are affiliated with the company s daily newspapers and non daily publications 
the company promotes single copy sales of its newspapers because it believes that such sales have even higher readership than subscription sales  and that single copy readers tend to be more active consumers of goods and services  as indicated by an naa study 
single copy sales also tend to generate higher profit margins than subscription sales  as single copy sales generally have higher per unit prices and lower distribution costs 
subscription sales  which provide readers with the convenience of home delivery  are an important component of the company s circulation base 
the company also publishes numerous special sections and niche and special interest publications 
such publications tend to increase readership within targeted demographic groups and geographic areas 
the company s management believes that as a result of these strategies  its newspapers represent an attractive and cost effective medium for its readers and advertisers

critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  remaining useful lives of long lived assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  as well as contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and actuarial studies and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives for the years presented in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if required  for impairment 
this asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses estimates for future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal year if the provisions of sfas no 
were applied to the company s fiscal year results  the company s amortization expense would have been reduced by approximately million and  correspondingly  the company s earnings per diluted share would have increased by per diluted share for pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in determining these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future as a result of fluctuations in the company s headcount and changes in actuarial assumptions 
self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its insurance costs 
the company analyzes its claims experience and consults with actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insured claims 
litigation the company is involved in a number of litigation matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that the outcome of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue is earned from the sale of advertising  circulation and commercial printing 
advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions  in the period when advertising is printed or placed on the company s websites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers or other paid publications are distributed 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of apb no 
this interpretation provides new consolidation accounting guidance for entities involved with variable interest entities vie 
this guidance requires a primary beneficiary  defined as an entity which participates in either a majority of the risks or rewards of such vie  to consolidate the vie 
a vie would not be subject to this interpretation if such entity has sufficient voting equity capital such that the entity is able to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
interpretation had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
certain factors which may affect the company s future performance newspaper industry competition the company s business is concentrated in newspapers and other publications located primarily in small metropolitan and suburban areas in the united states 
revenues in the newspaper industry primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation 
competition for advertising and paid circulation comes from local  regional and national newspapers  shopping guides  television  radio  direct mail  online services and other forms of communication and advertising media 
competition for advertising revenues is based largely upon advertiser results  readership  advertising rates  demographics and circulation levels  while competition for circulation and readership is based largely upon the content of the newspaper  its price and the effectiveness of its distribution 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
dependence on local economies the company s advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenues are dependent on a variety of factors specific to the communities which the company s newspapers serve 
these factors include  among others  the size and demographic characteristics of the local population  local economic conditions in general  and the related retail segments in particular  as well as local weather conditions 
capitalization as of december   the consolidated indebtedness of the company was million  which represents a multiple of times the company s twelve months trailing ebitda of approximately million see reconciliation of certain non gaap financial measures 
as of december   the company had a net stockholders equity of million and total capitalization of million and  thus  the percentage of the company s indebtedness to total capitalization was percent 
the company may incur additional indebtedness to  among other things  fund operations  capital expenditures  future acquisitions or share repurchases 
the company s management believes that cash provided by operating activities  future borrowings and its ability to issue securities will be sufficient to fund its operations and to meet payment requirements under its term loans and the revolving credit facility of the credit agreement 
however  a decline in cash provided by operating activities  which could result from factors beyond the company s control  such as unfavorable economic conditions  an overall decline in advertising revenues or increased competition  could impair the company s ability to service its debt 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on the company  which may restrict  among other things  the company s ability to declare dividends  repurchase company stock  incur indebtedness  create liens  sell assets  consummate mergers and make capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions 
acquisition strategy the company has grown through  and anticipates that it will continue to grow through  acquisitions of daily and non daily newspapers and similar publications 
acquisitions may expose the company to risks  including  without limitation  diversion of management s attention  assumption of unidentified liabilities and assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
depending on the value and nature of the consideration paid by the company for acquisitions  such acquisitions may have a dilutive impact on the company s earnings per share 
in making acquisitions  the company competes for acquisition targets with other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities  assessing the value  strengths and weaknesses of such opportunities  executing acquisitions successfully  achieving anticipated synergies  evaluating the costs of new growth opportunities at existing operations or managing the publications it owns and improving their operating efficiency 
historically  the company has financed acquisitions through available cash  free cash flow  borrowings and sales of non strategic properties 
the company anticipates that it will finance future acquisitions through these same resources 
the credit agreement limits acquisitions to certain permitted investments and newspapers in the united states  and requires that acquisitions be financed through certain permitted sources 
in addition  the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement may limit the company s ability to make acquisitions
