item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading seasonality and variability in quarterly results of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the seasonal aspects of airnet s business 
competition the air and ground courier industry is highly competitive 
airnet s primary competitor in the transportation of cancelled checks is the federal reserve s check relay network 
the actions of the federal reserve are regulated by the monetary control act  which requires the federal reserve to price its services at actual cost plus a set percentage private sector adjustment factor 
airnet believes that the purpose of the monetary control act is to curtail the possibility of predatory pricing by the federal reserve when it competes with the private sector 
no assurance beyond the remedies of law can be given that the federal reserve will comply with the monetary control act 
in the private sector  there are a large number of smaller  regional carriers that transport cancelled checks  none of which airnet believes have significant interstate market share 
the two largest private sector air couriers  fedex and united parcel service ups  both carry cancelled checks where the deadlines being pursued fit into their existing system 
airnet does not believe that fedex or ups represent significant competitors in the time critical cancelled check market to date 
airnet provides customized service for its customer base  often with later pick ups and earlier deliveries than the large  national couriers provide 
airnet competes with commercial airlines and numerous other carriers in its express delivery business 
airnet estimates its market share in this industry at less than 
airnet believes that this market represents a significant expansion opportunity for ultra time critical shipments requiring later pick ups or earlier deliveries than are typically provided by major integrators and freight forwarders 
airnet believes that it is in an excellent position to leverage the use of its national air network system  airnet s proprietary information technology and its historically high on time performance level to compete in this market 
in the passenger charter business  airnet competes with other owner operators and charter brokers of small business jets 
airnet believes its nationwide network of maintenance and related support facilities provides added flexibility in deploying and servicing the passenger charter aircraft fleet to meet customer demands 
environmental matters airnet intends to commence construction of a new corporate and operational headquarters on land leased from the columbus regional port authority in portions of the leased land  as well as portions of the aircraft ramp  on which airnet intends to conduct a significant portion of its columbus operations  contain known pollution conditions 
the appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters addressing these sites are to be supplied to airnet by the columbus regional port authority prior to beginning construction 
airnet has received the applicable no further action letters 
identification of additional pollution conditions on the leased land or attached ramp or the inability of the columbus regional port authority to provide the approved amended post closure plan could increase costs and have an adverse affect on airnet s ability to construct the rickenbacker facility 
airnet believes that compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing environmental matters have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on airnet s capital expenditures  operations or competitive position

the company adopted the provisions of the sop in its consolidated financial statements as of january  which resulted in the write off of unamortized start up costs at that time 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general airnet s bank revenues continue to decline as a result of the continuing evolution of electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks and other market forces 
the decline in bank services requires that airnet restructure its existing transportation network which was originally established to service its bank customers 
airnet is taking steps to expand its express and passenger charter services businesses to offset the expected decline in bank services revenue 
in addition  airnet is evaluating and adjusting its aircraft mix and fleet size in response to these changing business conditions 
airnet introduced the caravan and eliminated the aerostar from its fleet in recent years and  barring new route requirements  intends to eliminate additional piston aircraft and its learjet s in airnet is reviewing its ground operations for efficiencies and cost reductions and will continue this review throughout the security surcharge and modified fuel surcharge will continue in changes in airnet s regional sales and operational structure  increased marketing efforts and adaptation of its fleet to changing market conditions are all critical to achieving airnet s goals 
the following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies of airnet 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements  which include additional information about airnet s significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie its financial results 
results of operations net revenues in s net revenues increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to delivery services net revenues bank services express services total delivery services revenues passenger charter services revenues aviation services revenues total revenues airnet has experienced overall net revenue growth each of the last three years 
this can be attributed to several factors including increased express shipment volume  growth in passenger charter services  the implementation of a security surcharge program in august and  increased revenues from the fuel surcharge program resulting from increased fuel prices and changes to the surcharge program implemented in airnet assesses its customers a fuel surcharge which is based on the oil price index summary columbus  ohio opis cmh index 
as index rates increase above a set threshold  surcharge rates increase 
in august  airnet modified its fuel surcharge program for its bank customers to help offset timing differences between market prices and the opis chm index used to determine surcharge rates 
in and through january  airnet s express customers paid a temporary fuel surcharge on most revenues under a separate program 
in february  airnet rescinded this temporary surcharge on express services revenues and implemented the program described above based on the opis cmh index 
bank services revenues in s bank services revenues increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to bank revenues fuel surcharge federal excise tax total net bank revenues consistent with airnet s expectations  bank revenues excluding the impact of fuel surcharge and federal excise taxes continue to decline year over year 
this decline slowed as airnet continues to focus on additional services for banks beyond cancelled check transportation  such as proof of deposit and interoffice mail delivery services 
from to weekday shipment volume decreased per flying day and weekend shipment volume per flying day was down by 
the decrease in weekly shipment volume was offset by increased fuel surcharges in as compared to lower check delivery volume as a result of historically low interest rates and the declining use of checks  contributed to the reduction in revenues  as did increased competitive factors from regional carriers and transportation cost reduction initiatives by airnet s bank customers 
airnet believes that this decline will continue as the check act becomes effective in october  however  at this time airnet is unable to predict the ultimate impact of this act on future years 
weekday shipment volume decreased from to a portion of the relative lost volume was attributed to additional volume in that was transported during the days immediately following the september  tragedy  during which airnet transported checks for several of its bank customers who relied on airnet for services their normal or secondary vendors could not provide at the time 
the decrease in weekday volume was partially offset by a increase in weekend shipment volume  rate increases implemented in january averaging approximately and the implementation of the security surcharge program related to bank customers in september express services revenues in s express services revenues increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to express revenues non charter express revenues charters fuel surcharge federal excise tax total net express revenues airnet s express services a variety of markets with its time critical shipping solutions through a combination of airnet s scheduled air and ground system  commercial airlines and dedicated charter services 
the increase in express revenues is primarily the result of airnet s efforts to diversify its revenue base and continue its penetration of the medical market 
revenues from medical and related companies increased in as airnet continues to expand its services for transportation of radiopharmaceutical drugs  diagnostic specimens  umbilical cord blood for cryogenic storage and human blood and tissue 
airnet also increased its revenues for services in the media and entertainment market by in compared to  a market where customers demand a reliable and secure transportation system for the distribution of film screenings and tape distribution 
while airnet experienced a decrease in revenues from dedicated charters from to  the decrease was offset by growth in the scheduled nightly volume of non charter shipments  approximately of which are transported via the airnet air transportation network 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increased shipment volume due to increased market penetration in select markets such as medical  as well as a rate increase to most customers in february and an increase in security surcharge in august passenger charter services revenues in s passenger charter revenues increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to passenger charter services revenues average annual number of jets average revenues per jet passenger charter services revenues have shown the largest percentage growth for airnet in recent years 
as airnet commits additional investment in this area  it expects revenue growth to continue as it widens the distribution of its passenger charter aircraft in the united states 
airnet s passenger charter services allow customers greater control and flexibility in air travel than commercial airlines 
airnet has increased its passenger charter fleet from three aircraft at december  to seven at december  and nine at december  airnet s passenger charter fleet includes owned aircraft as well as leased and managed aircraft 
airnet will continue to invest in the passenger charter business with the anticipated addition of four aircraft in  all of which are expected to be midsized learjet aircraft 
aviation services revenues these revenues primarily relate to the airnet s fixed base operation and maintenance services provided in columbus  ohio 
while these services will continue  no significant future growth is expected 
operating expenses and income from continuing operations in s operating costs and expenses increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft maintenance contracted air costs ground courier depreciation insurance  rent and landing fees travel  training and other total operating costs and expenses the increase in passenger charter services from to accounted for million  or  of the overall increase in operating expenses 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to increased hours flown and service and support costs associated with the increase in express shipment volumes 
flight hours for the cargo fleet increased from to  but remained flat from to an increase in pilots to support the passenger charter operation accounted for of the increase in wages and benefits from to additional customer support center staff to service the increase in express shipment volume and an increase in health benefits costs resulted in a increase in wages and benefits 
the increase from to is also attributed primarily to the increase in passenger charter pilot staff and express support staff 
in s aircraft fuel increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to aircraft fuel fuel surcharge revenues net hours flown increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to hours flown total aircraft fuel expense has increased year over year as a result of the increase in the number of hours flown as well as the increase in fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel has increased in compared to and decreased in compared to increased operational efficiencies allowed airnet to reduce fuel burn per hour in by compared to and airnet continues to maintain its fuel surcharge program to offset these increases in fuel expense 
the amounts related to the fuel surcharge program are classified as revenue 
while overall hours flown from to increased only slightly  maintenance expense remained flat as airnet began to experience the benefits of phasing out the aerostar aircraft in and and replacing them with the more operating efficient cessna caravans 
the increase in maintenance expense from to was directly related to the increase in flight hours 
contracted air expense includes costs associated with shipments transported on the commercial airlines and costs to third party air operators for subleased air routes and back up charter services 
commercial airline costs decreased from to and from to as airnet was able to secure better rates with the commercial carriers it utilizes most often 
back up and sublease charter expenses decreased from to as airnet decreased its reliance on outside providers as a result of adding aircraft and pilots 
however  the expense increased from to as airnet  once again  began to experience pilot shortages and elected to outsource more routes 
in s ground courier costs increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to company courier costs contracted courier costs total ground courier costs number of bank shipments number of non charter express shipments number of charter express shipments the increase in ground costs can be primarily attributed to the increase in express services shipment volume 
airnet continues to shift its ground services from employees to contracted vendors and independent contractors to better align its costs with the more variable express shipment volumes 
historically  ground courier cost per shipment levels were lower as most bank deliveries were scheduled or transportation services were from airport to airport with limited ground services 
the express services business requires expanded delivery services  generally in a more unscheduled environment with greater fluctuations in day to day shipment volumes 
depreciation expense in s increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to aircraft aircraft improvements  engines  inspections other total depreciation aircraft depreciation has increased significantly in and compared to as airnet has added aircraft and accelerated deprecation related to its cessna s and lear s 
airnet continually reviews the remaining useful life and expected salvage value of its aircraft in connection with its depreciation calculation 
aircraft and engines are depreciated based on the number of hours flown 
increased depreciation in over is also related to the increased hours flown 
other depreciation includes depreciation related to building and leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software and vehicles 
insurance  rent and landing fees in s increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to insurance rent ramp  landing and tie down fees total insurance  rent and landing fees with the firming of the aviation insurance market after the september  tragedy  airnet has continued to incur increased insurance costs related to operating the air transportation network 
in addition  increases in its fleet size and value have increased the cost of insurance coverage 
airnet expects that the insurance market will remain firm in the near future 
rent expense increased in and mainly due to airnet leasing additional aircraft for both its delivery services and its passenger charter services businesses 
selling  general and administrative costs in s increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to total selling  general and administrative costs less severance costs selling  general and administrative  net of severance airnet has incurred substantial severance costs due to changes in its management group in and selling  general and administrative costs also increased as a result of several other factors 
airnet self insures its employee group medical coverage 
claims have increased significantly year over year with the largest increase in primarily due to increased prescription drug costs  several high dollar claims  and rising medical costs in general 
airnet annually reviews its medical insurance costs and continues to work to reduce these costs 
professional fees increased substantially in and related to the expansion of the passenger charter business as well as lobbying efforts related to bank services 
airnet expects to incur substantial costs in and related to ensuring compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
airnet continues to work toward identifying additional cost reduction opportunities and to create more efficiency in its air transportation network 
impairment charges in  airnet tested its remaining goodwill for impairment in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and found there was no impairment and  therefore  no charge against goodwill was made during in  airnet recorded a million  or per diluted share  non cash after tax charge in accordance with its adoption of sfas no 
a review of goodwill associated with the purchase of mercury business services  indicated that the million pre tax of remaining goodwill related to this acquisition was impaired as of january   and therefore an impairment charge was recorded in under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 this non cash charge was treated as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of january  in  airnet recorded a non recurring million impairment charge on its investment in the check exchange systems co 
chexs 
float control  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of airnet holds a interest in chexs 
float control accounts for its investment in chexs under the equity method of accounting 
during  chexs received notice that one of its customers  who accounted for a significant portion of chexs revenue  would not renew its contract with chexs beyond august as a result  the million impairment charge on investment was recorded in the second quarter of this charge included approximately million of goodwill 
interest expense in s increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to interest expense average debt balances average annual interest rate interest expense decreased from to due to a reduction in debt and lower interest rates 
interest expense remained flat from to as an increase in debt was offset by significantly lower interest rates 
airnet plans on investing in its passenger charter services business and expects to begin construction of a new corporate and operational headquarters in these investments are expected to be financed through debt  which is expected to increase interest costs in income taxes in s increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to increase decrease to income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes effective income tax rate airnet s effective tax rates  excluding the effect of discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change  were for  for  and for the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of permanent differences expenses which are not deductible for tax purposes and state franchise taxes based on equity 
discontinued operations on august   airnet completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its mercury business services unit to mercury business services  inc  a delaware corporation owned by a group that includes the original owners of the mercury business 
the sales price of the transaction was approximately million 
mercury business services  inc paid approximately  of the sales price through the issuance of a ninety day promissory note secured by the assets being sold and guaranteed by each of the shareholders of mercury business services  inc under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  approximately  of the purchase price was paid with airnet common shares owned by the shareholders of mercury business services  inc  including  common shares tendered to airnet prior to closing at per share the closing price of the airnet shares on the nyse on july  and  common shares tendered to airnet on the closing date at per share the average closing price of the airnet shares on the nyse on august

based upon projected engine hours in  airnet estimates the cost of the fmp to be approximately  airnet anticipates that cash flow from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet airnet s expected long term needs for the operation of its business  including anticipated capital expenditures 
there were no material capital commitments at december  under the terms of gerald g 
mercer s retirement agreement  airnet purchased  common shares from mr 
mercer at a total cost of million in july this privately negotiated transaction was funded through a revolving bank credit facility and airnet intends to hold these common shares in treasury

mercer or spring hill camps 
airnet has filed a registration statement with respect to those common shares under the securities act of  as amended  for resale on behalf of the investors 
in february  airnet announced a stock repurchase program allowing airnet to purchase up to million of its common shares 
during  airnet purchased million in common shares funded by cash flows from operations 
there was no repurchase activity under this program in  or as such  purchases of approximately million of airnet s common shares may still be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
such future purchases would be considered based on availability of funds  current market conditions and the stock price 
following is a summary of airnet s capital expenditures in millions for through and expected amounts for aircraft aircraft improvements  engines and inspections increase in prepaid engine costs technology  rickenbacker facility and other total costs of major aircraft inspections  overhauls and engine work are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown 
the original cost of airframes less a salvage value is depreciated based on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the aircraft 
aircraft maintenance costs not meeting airnet s capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred 
in  the engines of approximately in  and in of airnet s learjet aircraft were covered under fleet maintenance plan fmp  in which airnet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs 
these prepayments  which totaled approximately million at december  approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  are classified in fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until services have been performed  at which time the prepaid balances are reclassified into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown 
airnet intends to cover all of its lear jet engines under fmp plans over the next several years as major overhauls on the non covered engines become due 
although airnet has historically financed long term capital investments through the use of internally generated cash from operations or revolving bank credit facilities  all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital 
based upon such consideration  airnet entered into two five year term loans in totaling approximately million with fixed interest rates of  each secured by an aircraft  and a million term loan with a floating interest rate based upon libor  secured by two aircraft 
in december  airnet financed the  cost of a learjet for its passenger charter services business using its bank credit facility

in september the lease terms were extended an additional year 
in january airnet also entered into operating leases for two cessna caravan b aircraft  one with a lease term of years and one with a lease term of years 
airnet determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values  liquidity and after tax cash flows 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  airnet does not record operating leases in its consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements to the accompanying audited financial statements 
in september  airnet entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility and a five year million unsecured term loan 
the term loan requires quarterly installments of million 
the agreement bears interest at airnet s option of a fixed rate based upon libor plus a margin determined by its leverage ratio as defined in the agreement  or a floating rate based on the greater of the prime rate and the sum of 
plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time 
the new agreement requires the maintenance of certain minimum tangible net worth and cash flow levels  imposes certain limitations on capital expenditures and the sale of assets  and restricts the amount of additional debt 
as of december   there was million available under the credit facility 
as of march  airnet is negotiating a new  secured bank revolving credit facility with its existing bank group to increase borrowing availability 
airnet expects to finalize the new credit facility in april seasonality and variability in quarterly results airnet s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal relative to holidays observed by financial institutions 
when financial institutions are closed on holidays falling on monday through thursday  airnet s revenue and net income are adversely affected 
airnet s fiscal quarter ending december is often the most impacted by bank holidays 
operating results are also affected by the weather 
winter weather often requires additional costs for de icing  hangar rental and other aircraft services 
airnet generally experiences higher maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending march selected quarterly data unaudited the following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods ended in thousands  except per share data quarters ended  march june september december net revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax note net income per share basic and diluted income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income per share net revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income loss from discontinued operations note cumulative effect of accounting change note net income loss note per share basic and diluted income loss from continuing operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss note note in august  airnet sold the assets of its mercury business services unit  resulting in discontinued operations 
note airnet adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in in accordance with the transition provisions of this statement  airnet recorded the cumulative effect of the accounting change effective january  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
airnet maintains a thorough process to review the application of its accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates  however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies  and are material to airnet s financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and with its independent auditors 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable historically  airnet s credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because its credit management processes have been effective 
airnet also recognizes billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts  money back service guarantees and billing corrections 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts  adjustments processed  current collection trends  and the individual assessment of customers credit quality 
once airnet considers all these factors  a determination is made as to the need for a bad debt allowance 
allowances for these future adjustments aggregated million at december  and million at december  airnet considers the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate  as changes in economic conditions and pricing arrangements can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances 
major aircraft maintenance costs of major aircraft inspections  overhauls and engine work are capitalized as incurred and depreciated based on hours flown 
the original costs of airframes  less an estimated salvage value  are depreciated based on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the aircraft 
aircraft maintenance costs not meeting airnet s capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred 
the engines of approximately of airnet s learjet aircraft are covered under fleet management plan fmp  in which airnet prepays certain repair and overhaul costs 
these prepayments  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  are classified in fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin until services have been performed  at which time the prepaid balances are reclassified into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown 
airnet intends to cover all of its learjet jet engines under fmp plans over the next several years as major overhauls on the non covered engines become due 
property and equipment airnet s delivery service and passenger charter service businesses are capital intensive 
over of its total assets are invested in flight equipment to serve these markets 
airnet capitalizes only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
the depreciation or amortization of airnet s capital assets over their estimated useful lives  and the determination of any salvage values  requires management to make judgments about future events 
because airnet utilizes many of its capital assets over relatively long periods  management periodically evaluates whether adjustments to estimated lives or salvage values are necessary 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
historically  gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material 
however  such amounts may differ materially in the future based on technological obsolescence  accident frequency  regulatory requirements  and other factors beyond airnet s control 
airnet must project aircraft requirements multiple years in advance based on expected volume levels 
as a result  airnet has risk that capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of its assets may occur 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
because the cash flows of airnet s transportation network cannot be identified to individual assets  and based on the ongoing profitability of its operations  airnet has not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time airnet makes decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of capacity needs  and those decisions may result in a loss being recognized 
stock based compensation airnet accounts for stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs related to stock options to be recorded in net income  as all options granted under its stock option plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common shares at grant date 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 provides guidance on acceptable approaches to the implementation of sfas no 
 and requires more prominent disclosures of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share determined as if the fair value method of accounting for stock options had been applied in measuring compensation cost 
stock options are further detailed in the notes to airnet s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
self insurance accruals airnet is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims and benefits paid under employee health care programs 
at december   airnet had total self insurance accruals reflected in its consolidated balance sheet of approximately million million at december  
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
airnet accounts for these costs primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 
airnet believes its recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on an appropriate basis  however  changes in health costs  loss development factors  accident frequency and severity  and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
incentive compensation plans airnet maintains a company wide incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of quarterly company earnings goals and personal departmental goals 
bonuses are calculated as a percent of base pay  depending on participation levels  which vary between management and staff levels 
costs related to the company earnings portion of the plan are accrued based on actual quarterly results 
at december  and december   no accrual existed for this portion of the plan  as the quarterly targets were not met 
airnet accrues for costs related to the personal departmental goals portion of the plan based on estimated achievement rates of set goals applied to individuals base pay rates 
payouts may be made quarterly or annually  depending on the nature of the goals 
at december  and  a million accrual was recorded for the personal departmental goals portion of the plan 
income taxes airnet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles accounting standards adopted in required that airnet cease all goodwill amortization and review intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment on an annual basis 
as previously indicated  the adoption of these new rules resulted in a transition impairment of its recorded goodwill of million million net of related deferred tax asset in airnet has elected to test for goodwill impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows to determine estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted results and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
airnet cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled  at december  such events could include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment and market factors on airnet s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationship with its significant customers 
forward looking statements the information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including those identified by the words believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  project and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements reflect management s expectations and are based upon currently available data  however  actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those projected in these statements 
the following factors  in addition to those included in the disclosure under the heading risk factors below  could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements potential regulatory changes by the federal aviation administration  which could increase the regulation of airnet s business  or the federal reserve  which could change the competitive environment of transporting canceled checks  disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions and air traffic control related constraints  potential declines in the values of aircraft in airnet s fleet and any related asset impairment charges  the ability to successfully market the passenger charter business in light of global changes in the commercial airline industry  potential changes in locally and federally mandated security requirements  increases in aviation fuel costs not fully offset by airnet s fuel surcharge program  potential cost overruns associated with the construction of a new facility  changes in check processing and shipment patterns of bank customers  acts of war and terrorist activities  the impact of prolonged weakness in the u 
s 
economy on time critical shipment volumes  the acceptance of airnet s time critical service offerings within targeted express markets  technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers  and other economic  competitive and domestic and foreign governmental factors affecting airnet s markets  prices and other facets of its operations 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
airnet assumes no obligation or duty to update any of the forward looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k except to the extent required by law 
risk factors competition from other providers of express air and ground delivery services may adversely affect airnet s results of operations and financial condition 
airnet s bank services competes primarily against the federal reserve s check relay network  which has significantly greater financial and other resources than airnet 
the federal reserve is regulated by the monetary control act of  which in general requires that the federal reserve price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment factor 
failure by the federal reserve to comply with the monetary control act by pricing its services below the required rates could have an adverse competitive impact on airnet 
in addition  the monetary control act may be amended  modified or repealed  or new legislation affecting airnet s business may be enacted 
the market for express air and ground delivery service is highly competitive 
although major participants in the next day and second day air delivery market such as ups and fedex have also entered the business of same day and early morning delivery  they have not had a material adverse effect on airnet s business to date 
however  the efforts of these competitors could have a material adverse effect on airnet in the future 
the check act or similar legislation could have a significant adverse effect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
in october  the check act was signed into law with a one year waiting period prior to becoming effective 
the check act creates a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check also known as an image replacement document or ird that becomes the legal equivalent of the original item 
the check act effectively removes the requirement of returning an original paper check to the account holder s institution and requires that all financial institutions accept an ird in lieu of a cancelled check 
when it becomes effective in october  the check act will likely accelerate the transition in the banking industry to electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks and will eventually replace the need for expedited air transportation services of original cancelled checks by most of airnet s banking customers 
the check act eventually will have a significant adverse affect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
however  it is unclear when such an electronic clearing system will be implemented on a widespread basis by banking customers and how such implementation would affect their expedited check transportation needs 
other technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems may adversely affect the demand for airnet s bank services from the financial services industry 
some analysts have predicted that the increased use of electronic funds transfers will lead to a checkless society  which could adversely affect the demand for airnet s bank services to the financial services industry 
in addition  some financial services industry analysts have predicted the development of various forms of imaging technology that could reduce or eliminate the need for prompt delivery of cancelled checks 
similarly  technological advances in the nature of electronic mail and telefax have affected the demand for on call delivery services by customers needing express delivery services 
while none of these technological advances has had a significant adverse impact on airnet s business to date  these or similar technologies  or other regulatory or technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems  could have an adverse affect on airnet s business in the future 
government regulation significantly affects airnet 
airnet s delivery operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
failure by airnet to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with the applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of airnet s authority to conduct certain of its operations 
airnet s flight operations are regulated by the faa under part of the federal aviation regulations 
among other things  these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews 
the faa is currently contemplating certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines which  if adopted  could increase airnet s operating costs 
these changes  if adopted  could also require airnet and other operators regulated by the faa to hire additional flight crew personnel 
in addition  congress  from time to time  has considered various means  including excise taxes  to raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and personnel 
there can be no assurances that congress will not change the current federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes  which could adversely affect airnet s business 
reclassification of ground couriers as employees rather than independent contractors could impact airnet s operating costs and subject it to back taxes and other liabilities 
airnet uses the services of independent contractors as couriers to pick up and deliver its packages 
from time to time  federal and state authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation industry  including independent contractors providing services similar to those utilized by airnet  are employees rather than independent contractors 
airnet currently classifies its couriers providing services under an independent contractor agreement as independent contractors rather than as employees 
however  there can be no assurance that federal or state authorities will not challenge this position  or that other laws or regulations  including tax laws or interpretations thereof  will not change 
if  as a result of any of the foregoing  airnet were required to pay withholding taxes and pay for and administer added employee benefits to these couriers  airnet s operating costs could increase 
additionally  in the event of any such reclassification  airnet could be required to pay back up withholding with respect to amounts previously paid to such individuals and be required to pay penalties or be subject to other liabilities as a result of the incorrect classification of such individuals  such as payment of past due workers compensation and unemployment insurance premiums 
changes to current transportation security requirements or procedures could adversely impact the airnet s ability to efficiently conduct its air and ground operations to meet its current delivery parameters or significantly increase costs to transact those operations 
considerable focus has been placed on package security requirements and procedures at domestic and international airports since the september  tragedy and related incidents 
the tsa  commercial airlines  fixed based operations where airnet transacts a significant portion of its aircraft loading and unloading operations and airport authorities are still in the process of reviewing all aspects of their security requirements 
while many proposed changes are voluntary  many are being mandated by the tsa  the dot and the faa 
during  the tsa implemented screening procedures for over the counter cargo tendered to commercial airlines 
the new screening procedures have resulted in additional tender time for packages transported on the commercial airlines in certain locations and during certain times 
in addition  the tsa continues to review and consider additional package screening requirements and changes to the vendor screening procedures  which airnet may need to perform on packages from its customers 
many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments 
changes at fixed base operators and by local airport authorities could potentially limit airnet s ramp access to its aircraft  thereby increasing tender time from customers 
changes in chain of custody requirements could also potentially cause airnet to incur additional costs to staff additional hours at certain locations 
in response to the new security related procedures being implemented  airnet added a security surcharge in for its bank and express services customers 
although the surcharge is expected to help offset the increasing costs associated with security issues  airnet s current surcharge program may not be sufficient to cover all new costs it may incur as additional transportation safety procedures are developed and or required 
catastrophic accidents involving airnet s passenger charter aircraft could result in a significant reduction in its business and damage to its jetride brand 
a catastrophic accident could substantially reduce the demand for jetride s passenger charter services and  therefore  significantly reduce its revenue 
in addition  jetride may not be able to secure liability insurance for its business or secure such insurance at a reasonable cost 
environmental concerns related to the construction of a facility on leased land with known pollution conditions 
airnet intends to commence construction of the rickenbacker facility on land leased from the columbus regional port authority in portions of the leased land  as well as portions of the aircraft ramp  on which airnet intends to conduct a significant portion of its columbus operations  contain known pollution conditions 
the appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters addressing these sites are to be supplied to airnet by the columbus regional port authority prior to beginning construction 
airnet has received the applicable no further action letters 
identification of additional pollution conditions on the leased land or attached ramp or the inability of the columbus regional port authority to provide the approved amended post closure plan could increase costs and have an adverse affect on airnet s ability to construct the rickenbacker facility 
failure to renew party status to department of transportation e would result in significant loss of express services revenue 
airnet maintains party status to dot e  which permits airnet to transport higher volumes of radioactive pharmaceuticals than allowed by most air carriers 
airnet is required to renew its party status every two years 
although airnet anticipates it will obtain its dot e renewal at its next scheduled renewal date in november  there can be no assurances that the party status will be extended 
further  although airnet believes it is compliant with all current dot e requirements  there can be no assurances that such requirements will not change in the future negatively affecting airnet s ability to maintain such status 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of airnet by a third party 
provisions of airnet s amended articles and code of regulations and of the ohio revised code  together or separately  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of airnet and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the common shares 
among other things  these provisions require certain supermajority votes  establish advance notice procedures for shareholder nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and provide that directors may only be removed from office for cause 
airnet s amended articles authorize the board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without further shareholder approval  subject to any limitations prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange 
the preferred shares could have dividend  liquidation  conversion and other rights and privileges that are superior or senior to the common shares 
issuance of preferred shares could result in the dilution of the voting power of the common shares  adversely affect holders of the common shares in the event of liquidation of airnet or delay  defer or prevent a change in control of airnet 
in addition  section of the ohio revised code contains provisions that require shareholder approval of any proposed control share acquisition of any ohio corporation at any of three voting power thresholds one fifth  one third and a majority 
in addition  chapter of the ohio revised code contains provisions that restrict specified business combinations and other transactions between an ohio corporation and interested shareholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk airnet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
airnet s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at december   airnet had million outstanding on credit facilities subject to market rate changes in interest 
these facilities bear interest at various london interbank offering rates libors and floating rates based on prime rates and federal fund rates 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year 
in february  airnet entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank relative to a million term loan  with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of plus a margin based on airnet s funded debt ratio 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swap was approximately
