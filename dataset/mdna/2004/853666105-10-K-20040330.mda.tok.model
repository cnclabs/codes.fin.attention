item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for further discussion 
on february   we acquired the canadian distribution of dana corporation s engine management group for approximately million 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired inventory and will be relocating it into our distribution facility in mississauga  canada 
the automotive aftermarket the automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large  diverse number of manufacturers varying in product specialization and size 
in addition to manufacturing  aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend 
aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support 
aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute  with rapid turnaround times  products for a full range of vehicles on the road 
the primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are national and regional warehouse distributors  large retail chains  automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of the oem s 
during periods of economic decline or weakness  more automobile owners may choose to repair their current automobiles using replacement parts rather than purchasing new automobiles  which benefits the automotive aftermarket industry  including suppliers like us 
the automotive aftermarket industry is also dependent on new car sales  although to a lesser degree than original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and their suppliers  because these sales create the total number of cars available for repair 
despite the current economic climate  the current interest rate environment and aggressive financing programs by automakers has increased demand for new cars and trucks  which should benefit the automotive aftermarket manufacturers in the long term as vehicles age 
the automotive aftermarket industry differs substantially from the oem supply business 
unlike the oem supply business that primarily follows trends in new car production  the automotive aftermarket industry s performance primarily tends to follow different trends  such as o growth in number of vehicles on the road  o increase in average vehicle age  o increase in total miles driven per year  o new and modified environmental regulations  o increase in pricing of new cars  and o new car quality and related warranties 
traditionally  the supply arms of oems and the independent manufacturers who supply the original equipment part applications have supplied a majority of the business to new car dealer networks 
however  ford and general motors have recently moved to make their supply arms more independent  which may provide future opportunities for us to supply replacement parts to the dealer networks of the oem s  both for warranty and out of warranty repairs

engine management segment breadth of products 
in our engine management segment  which effective june  includes dem  replacement parts for ignition and emission control systems accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
these parts include distributor caps and rotors  electronic ignition control modules  voltage regulators  coils  switches  sensors and egr valves 
we are a basic manufacturer of many of the ignition parts we market and continue to develop ways of increasing the number of parts we manufacture  rather than purchasing such parts from third parties 
the independence  kansas dem facility  which is one of the dem facilities which will remain operating  will further enhance our ability to be a basic manufacturer with ignition and emission control systems 
computer controlled technology 
nearly all new vehicles are factory equipped with computer controlled engine management systems to control ignition  emission control and fuel injection 
the on board computers monitor inputs from many types of sensors located throughout the vehicle  and control a myriad of valves  switches and motors to manage engine and vehicle performance 
electronic ignition systems enable the engine to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the level of hazardous fumes in exhaust gases 
electronic control modules and electronic voltage regulators comprised approximately  and of our total ignition and emission consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
in  we entered into a joint venture in canada with blue streak electronics  inc to rebuild automotive engine management computers and mass air flow sensors 
the volume of products produced by the joint venture are sold primarily to us and has positioned us as a key supplier in the growing remanufactured electronics markets 
the blue streak joint venture has further expanded its product range to include computers used in temperature control  anti lock brake systems and air bags 
we divide our electronic operations between product design and highly automated manufacturing operations in orlando  florida and assembly operations  which are performed in assembly plants in orlando and hong kong 
government emission laws have been implemented throughout the majority of the united states 
the clean air act  as amended in  imposes strict emission control test standards on existing and new vehicles  and remains the preeminent legislation in the area of vehicle emissions 
as many states have implemented required inspection maintenance tests  the environmental protection agency  through its rulemaking ability  has also encouraged both manufacturers and drivers to reduce vehicle emissions 
as the clean air act was phased in beginning in  automobiles must now comply with emission standards from the time they were manufactured  and in most states  until the last day they are in use 
this law has  and in the future we expect this law and other new government emission laws to have  a positive impact on sales of our ignition and emission controls parts 
vehicles failing these new  more stringent tests have required repairs utilizing parts sold by us 
our sales of sensors  valves  solenoids and related parts have increased steadily as automobile manufacturers equip their cars with more complex engine management systems 
wire and cable products 
wire and cable parts accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
these products include ignition spark plug wires  battery cables and a wide range of electrical wire  terminals  connectors and tools for servicing an automobile s electrical system 
the largest component of this product line is the sale of ignition wire sets 
we have historically offered a premium brand of ignition wires and battery cables which capitalize on the market s awareness of the importance of quality 
in  we relocated two of our wire and cable operations  one in dallas  texas and the other in bradenton  florida  to a new facility in reynosa  mexico 
the mexican operation focuses on assembly and packaging of the economy wire sets  while our premium line is manufactured at our facility in edwardsville  kansas 
with the acquisition of dem s business  we acquired the ability to extrude our own wire in mishawaka  indiana to be used in our ignition wire sets 
this vertical integration of a critical component offers us the ability to achieve lower costs and our own controlled source of supply and quality 
temperature control segment we manufacture  remanufacture and market a broad line of replacement parts for automotive temperature control and cooling systems air conditioning  heating and engine cooling  primarily under the brand names of four seasons  factory air  murray  trumark  napa  carquest  hayden and imperial 
the major product groups sold by our temperature control segment are new and remanufactured compressors  blower and radiator fan motors  dryers  evaporators  accumulators  hoses  heater cores  heater valves  fan assemblies  fan clutches  engine oil coolers  and transmission coolers 
our temperature control products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
a major factor in the temperature control segment s business is the federal regulation of ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants united states legislation phased out the production of domestic r refrigerant 
eg  dupont s freon completely by the end of as the new law became effective  vehicle air conditioners needing repair or recharge were retrofitted to use the new r a refrigerant 
new vehicle manufacturers began to use the new r a refrigerant in and today the vast majority of the us vehicle fleet uses this refrigerant 
service dealers continue to seek training and certification in the new technology and our temperature control segment has taken the lead in providing this training and certification 
additionally  we reengineered our compressor line to be able to operate efficiently utilizing either r or r a refrigerants  and remain a leader in providing retrofit kits for conversion of r systems 
europe segment in july  we acquired an equity interest in standard motor products smp holdings limited formerly intermotor holdings limited located in nottingham  england 
this was our first investment in europe 
during  we acquired the remaining equity interest bringing the company s ownership percentage to 
smp holdings limited manufactures and distributes a broad line of engine management products primarily to customers in europe 
also in  we expanded our presence in europe by opening a european distribution center in strasbourg  france for temperature control products 
a joint venture blue streak europe between smp holdings limited and blue streak electronics was also initiated in  which supplies rebuilt engine computers for the european market 
since  we have made a series of smaller acquisitions supplementing both the engine management and temperature control portions of the business 
with respect to the engine management business  in january we acquired webcon uk limited  an assembler and distributor of fuel system components 
we subsequently divested the webcon product line in the third quarter of incurring an million loss 
in  we acquired lemark auto accessories  a supplier of wire sets 
in january  blue streak europe acquired injection correction uk ltd  and in september  it also acquired trw inc s electronic control unit remanufacturing division  also located in the united kingdom 
in april of  the wire business was further expanded by acquiring carol cable limited  a manufacturer and distributor of wire 
with respect to the temperature control portion of the business  following the opening of the distribution center in france  in a joint venture was entered into with valeo  sa to remanufacture air conditioner compressors for the european market 
in addition  in january we acquired four seasons uk ltd 
formerly vehicle air conditioning parts ltd 
a distributor of components for the repair of air conditioning systems 
in july  the temperature control business was further expanded by purchasing automotive heater exchange srl in italy 
our european segment accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in   and  respectively 
aftermarket margins are under pressure from oe suppliers  while volumes are in a general decline in the ignition and carburetor product lines 
the combination of factors has had a negative impact on engine management product sales with increasing amounts of underabsorbed overhead 
we are currently focusing on ways of reducing manufacturing costs  including outsourcing products where their respective volumes are declining and margins can be improved by outsourcing 
in addition  we have made investments in capital projects to facilitate the sale of new oe niche customers and the aftermarket 
we have also consolidated certain facilities and are reducing costs wherever we can 
unlike engine management sales  european temperature control product sales are increasing 
through acquisitions and more importantly a growing market  net sales have increased from million in to million in to date  the focus has been on product coverage and high customer service levels 
we have consolidated certain facilities and are reducing costs wherever we can 
financial information about our foreign and domestic operations and export sales we sell our line of products primarily in the united states  with additional sales in canada  europe and latin america 
our sales are substantially denominated in us dollars 
the table below shows our consolidated net sales by geographic area for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands united states    europe    canada    other foreign    total    the table below shows our long lived assets by geographical area for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands united states    europe    canada    other foreign   total    sales and distribution over the last ten years  there has been a trend toward consolidation in the distribution chain  both by warehouse distributors and retailers  and both vertically and horizontally 
in the traditional distribution channel  where we sell our products to warehouse distributors  such distributors supply auto parts jobbers  who in turn sell to professional mechanics and to consumers who perform automotive repairs themselves 
in recent years  distributors have been consolidating with other distributors  as well as jobbers 
an increasing number of distributors own their jobbers 
in addition  in certain cases jobbers have consolidated and formed their own buying group 
in the retail distribution channel  retailers  who buy directly from us  sell directly to technicians and do it yourselfers 
retailers are also consolidating among themselves and expanding into the jobber market 
as automotive parts grow more complex  consumers are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on dealers and technicians 
in addition to new car sales  automotive dealers sell name brand aftermarket parts and accessories and also service vehicles 
the products available through the dealers are purchased through the original equipment service network  or oes network 
traditionally  the supply arms of oem s have supplied a majority of oes network 
however  the supply arms of certain oem s have become more independent  which is providing opportunities for independent automotive aftermarket manufacturers like us to supply the oes network 
we believe that our sales force is the premier direct sales force for our product lines 
we believe the primary reason for this reputation is our high concentration of highly qualified  well trained salespeople dedicated to geographic territories  which allows us to provide a level of customer service that we believe is unmatched 
from the outset  we thoroughly train our salespeople both in the function and application of our product lines  as well as in proven sales techniques 
customers  therefore  depend on these salespeople as a reliable source for technical information 
we give newly hired salespeople extensive instruction at our training facility in irving  texas and have a policy of continuing education that allows our sales force to stay current on troubleshooting and repair techniques  as well as the latest automotive parts and systems technology 
we generate demand for our products by directing a significant portion of our sales effort to the end customers customers ie jobbers and professional technicians 
we also conduct instructional clinics  which teach technicians how to diagnose and repair complex systems related to our products 
to help our salespeople to be teachers and trainers  we focus our recruitment efforts on candidates who already have strong technical backgrounds as well as sales experience 
we also create demand for our products through the standard plus club 
our standard plus club  a professional service dealer network offers technical and business development support and has a technical service telephone hotline which provides diagnostics and installation support 
this club is available to technicians and provides training  special discount programs and on line diagnostics assistance 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer several types of discounts and allowances 
we believe these discounts and allowances are a common practice throughout the automotive aftermarket industry 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the discounted terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
supplementally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances 
in addition to the aforementioned discounts and rebates  allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
customers our customer base is comprised largely of warehouse distributors  large jobber outlets  other manufacturers and export customers 
in addition to serving our traditional customer base  we have expanded into the retail market by selling to large retail chains such as advance auto parts  autozone  csk auto  o reilly automotive and pep boys 
our retail channel of distribution has grown significantly from approximately million in consolidated net sales to retailers in to approximately million in in  we commenced distributing our products through the oes supplier channel  and sold approximately million in consolidated net sales to oes suppliers which increased to approximately million in our five largest individual customers accounted for of our consolidated net sales 
one individual customer accounted for of our consolidated net sales 
competition we are a leading independent manufacturer of replacement parts for the product lines in engine management and temperature control 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  product quality  customer service  product coverage  product availability  order turn around time and order fill rate 
we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily through o a value added  knowledgeable sales force  o extensive product coverage  o sophisticated parts cataloguing systems  and o inventory levels sufficient to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers 
in the engine management business  we are one of the leading independent manufacturers in the united states 
our significant competitors include delco electonics corporation  delphi corporation  federal mogul corporation  robert bosch corporation and wells manufacturing corporation 
our temperature control business is one of the leading independent producers and distributors of a full line of temperature control products in north america and other geographic areas 
delphi corporation  visteon corporation  ac delco  transpro  inc and jordan automotive aftermarket  inc 
are some of our key competitors in this market 
although we are a leading independent manufacturer of automotive replacement parts with strong brand name recognition  we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve 
the automotive aftermarket is highly competitive and our success in the marketplace continues to depend on our ability to offer competitive prices  improved products and expanded offerings in competition with many other suppliers to the aftermarket 
some major manufacturers of replacement parts are divisions of companies having greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  automobile manufacturers supply virtually every replacement part sold by us  although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they produce 
seasonality historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year  with revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered a choice of a price discount or longer payment terms 
working capital management automotive aftermarket companies have been under increasing pressure to provide broad sku stock keeping unit coverage in response to parts and brand proliferation 
since  we have made significant changes to the inventory management system to reduce inventory requirements 
we launched a new forecasting system in our engine management segment that permitted a significant reduction in safety stocks 
our engine management segment also introduced a new distribution system in the second half of  which permits pack to order systems to be implemented 
such systems permit us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until an order for a specific brand part is received 
this system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory and reduces the labor requirements to package and repackage inventory 
we instituted an aggressive inventory reduction campaign initiated in we targeted a minimum million inventory reduction in  but exceeded our goal by reducing inventory by million that year 
in and  we further reduced inventory by million and million  respectively  before giving consideration to the dem acquisition 
importantly  while reducing inventory levels  we maintained customer service fill rate levels of approximately 
by the end of  we plan on reducing inventories further as dem begins to become integrated 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
in particular  the seasonality of our temperature control segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  beginning in we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not follow a twelve step warranty return process 
our profitability and working capital requirements have become more seasonal with the increased sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
suppliers the principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass  electronic components  fabricated copper primarily in the form of magnet and insulated cable  ignition wire  stainless steel coils and rods  aluminum coils and rods  lead  rubber molding compound  thermo set and thermo plastic molding powders 
additionally  we use components and cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for computerized electronics and air conditioning compressors 
we purchase many materials in the us open market  but do have a limited number of supply agreements on key components 
a number of prime suppliers make these materials available 
in the case of cores  we obtain them either from exchanges with customers who return cores when purchasing remanufactured parts  or through direct purchases from a network of core brokers 
we believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores 
in order to ensure a consistent  high quality  low cost supply of key components for each product line  we continue to develop our own sources through internal manufacturing capacity 
recently  prices of steel and other commodities have risen 
these increases did not have a material impact on us as we are not dependent on any single commodity  however  there can be no assurance over the long term 
production and engineering we engineer  tool and manufacture many of the components for our products  except for some commonly available small component parts from outside suppliers 
we also perform our own plastic and rubber molding operations  stamping and machining operations  automated electronics assembly and a wide variety of other processes 
in the case of remanufactured components  we conduct our own teardown  diagnostics and rebuilding for computer modules and air conditioning compressors 
we have found this level of vertical integration to provide advantages in terms of cost  quality and availability 
we intend to selectively continue efforts toward further vertical integration to ensure a consistent quality and supply of low cost components 
the dem acquisition has expanded our ability to become a basic supplier 
we use the just in time cellular manufacturing concept as a major program to lower costs and improve efficiency 
the main thrust of just in time cellular manufacturing is reducing work in process and finished goods inventory  and its implementation reduces the inefficient operations that burden many manufacturing processes 
in  we launched a program for the installation of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system 
the implementation was completed in in our temperature control segment 
the existing engine management information system continues to meet the needs of our engine management segment with dem facilities being converted onto such systems during employees as of december   we employed approximately  people in the united states  and  people in mexico  canada  puerto rico  europe and hong kong 
of these  approximately  are production employees 
with the closing of the dem facilities  during  we expect a net reduction of approximately people from the approximate  employed in june we operate primarily in non union facilities and have binding labor agreements with the workers at our two unionized facilities 
we have approximately production employees in edwardsville  kansas who are covered by a contract with the international union  united automobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw that expires april  as of december   approximately of our production employees in long island city  new york are under a uaw contract that expires october  we also have a union relationship in mexico with an agreement negotiated each year 
the current union agreement in mexico  which covers approximately employees  expires on january  we believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers  and we believe our relations with our union and non union employees are good 
insurance we maintain basic liability coverage up to million for automobile liability  general and product liability and million for umbrella liability coverage 
we also maintain two million environmental policies to cover our existing facilities  except for one of our facilities which is currently undergoing minor environmental remediation and for the locations obtained from our acquisition of dem 
the environmental remediation costs at such facility are covered by an insurance policy of million  which is subject to a million deductible 
historically  we have not experienced casualty losses in any year in excess of our coverage 
we have no reason to expect this experience to change  but can offer no assurances that liability losses in the future will not exceed our coverage

item legal proceedings on january   a former significant customer of ours which is currently undergoing a chapter liquidation in us bankruptcy court filed claims against a number of its former suppliers  including us 
the claim against us alleged million of preferential payments in the days prior to the related chapter bankruptcy petition 
the claim pertaining to the preferential payments was settled for an immaterial amount during the second quarter of in addition  this former customer seeks million from us for a variety of claims including antitrust  breach of contract  breach of warranty and conversion 
these latter claims arise out of allegations that this customer was entitled to various discounts  rebates and credits after it filed for bankruptcy 
we have purchased insurance with respect to the actions 
on august   the court dismissed the antitrust claims 
on july   the remaining claims were settled without any material financial effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in  we acquired a brake business  which we subsequently sold in march and which is accounted for as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
when we originally acquired this brake business  we assumed future liabilities relating to any alleged exposure to asbestos containing products manufactured by the seller of the acquired brake business 
in accordance with the related purchase agreement  we agreed to assume the liabilities for all new claims filed on or after september  our ultimate exposure will depend upon the number of claims filed against us on or after september  and the amounts paid for indemnity and defense thereof 
at december   approximately cases were outstanding for which we were responsible for any related liabilities 
at december   the number of cases outstanding for which we were responsible for related liabilities increased to approximately  which include approximately  cases filed in december in mississippi 
we believe that these mississippi cases filed against us in december were due in large part to potential plaintiffs accelerating the filing of their claims prior to the effective date of mississippi s tort reform statute in january  which statute eliminated the ability of plaintiffs to file consolidated cases 
at december   approximately  cases were outstanding for which we were responsible for any related liabilities 
since inception in september  the amounts paid for settled claims are million 
we do not have insurance coverage for the defense and indemnity costs associated with these claims 
we recorded a liability associated with future settlements through and recorded an after tax charge of million as a loss from a discontinued operation during the third quarter of to reflect such liability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we are involved in various other litigation and product liability matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the final outcome of any asbestos related matters or any other litigation or product liability matter cannot be determined  based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances  it is our opinion that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  on board computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
as part of our efforts to grow our business  as well as to achieve increased production and distribution efficiencies  on june  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of dana corporation s engine management group subsequently referred to as dem 
prior to the sale  dem was a leading manufacturer of aftermarket parts in the automotive industry focused exclusively on engine management 
our plan is to restructure and to integrate the dem business into our existing engine management business 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid dana corporation million in cash  issued an unsecured promissory note of million  and issued  shares of our common stock valued at million 
including transaction costs  our total purchase price is expected to be approximately million 
we have reviewed our operations and implemented integration plans to restructure the operations of dem 
we announced in a press release on july   that we would close seven of the dem facilities 
as part of the integration and restructuring plans  we estimate total restructuring costs of million 
such amounts were recognized as liabilities assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire dem 
of the total restructuring costs  approximately million relates to work force reductions and employee termination benefits 
the amount primarily provides for severance costs relating to the involuntary termination of approximately  employees  individually employed throughout dem facilities across a broad range of functions  including managerial  professional  clerical  manufacturing and factory positions 
during  approximately million of termination benefits have been paid 
the restructuring also includes approximately million associated with exiting certain activities  primarily related to lease and contract termination costs 
specifically  our plans are to consolidate seven dem operations into our existing plants 
the restructuring accrual associated with other exiting activities specifically includes incremental costs and contractual termination obligations for items such as leasehold termination payments incurred as a direct result of these plans 
at december   one of the seven facilities has been closed with the remainder expected to be vacated during the dem acquisition in was strategic and continues to be our primary focus entering the critical goals we established for a successful integration were to maintain the dem customer base  reduce excess capacity by closing seven of the acquired facilities in a to month timeframe  complete the transition for million of cash outlays during this same period in restructuring and integration costs  and to achieve million in estimated annual savings 
we believe we are on target for meeting all of these goals 
based on our current expectations  we believe that the benefits from the above savings will materialize as we progress throughout and the full extent achieved in on february   we acquired the canadian distribution of dana corporation s engine management group for approximately million 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired inventory and will be relocating it into our distribution facility in mississauga  canada 
for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  refer to item business 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in excluding dem net sales of million  engine management net sales were down million during compared to the volume decline was in line with our forecasts  and would have been mitigated if we had implemented normal price level increases in  which have been implemented in the temperature control net sales decrease of million was primarily due to the loss of business with autozone and the very cool and wet weather conditions existing in the spring and early summer 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in  from in a combination of lower margins from dem and the loss in business in temperature control noted above  negatively effected gross margins during the period 
as dem is integrated  we do expect gross margins to improve as a result of operating efficiencies achieved in overhead absorption and material costs reductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million in  compared to million in excluding dem sg a expenses of million  sg a expenses decreased million in versus during we incurred approximately million of integration and restructuring expenses of which million related to dem and the remaining balance relating to our temperature control and european segments compared to million of restructuring expenses in reducing dem sg a expenses is a major focus during the dem integration and sg a is expected to significantly decrease 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead  is subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
we completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
during the first quarter of  we performed our initial impairment test of goodwill reviewing the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method  based on our weighted average cost of capital and market multiples 
the decline in economic and market conditions  higher integration costs than anticipated and the general softness in the automotive aftermarket caused a decrease in the fair values of certain of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill as a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  or per diluted share during the first quarter of the impairment loss relates to goodwill of million in our european segment and million in our temperature control segment 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we wrote off approximately million for the impairment of goodwill associated with the engine management reporting unit of our european segment 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in consolidated net sales as discussed above and the acquisition of dem 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased million primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange losses and lower interest and dividend income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million in  compared to  due to lower interest rates 
income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations was in and in the increase was primarily due to lower earnings in our domestic operations as compared to and operating losses in our european segment for which no income tax benefit has been recorded 
our foreign income tax relates primarily to our profitable canadian and hong kong operations 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation in reflects million associated with asbestos related legal expenses 
in  the million charge included a reserve for future indemnification and legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
based on the information contained in the september actuarial study  which estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million  and all other available information considered by us  we recorded an after tax charge of million as a loss from discontinued operation during the third quarter of to reflect such liability  excluding legal costs 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for increased by million over to million 
this net increase was driven by a million increase in engine management  year over year 
new business was the primary contributor with gains achieved in the retail business where certain customers expanded their own business  new wire and cable business acquired from an existing customer  and new original equipment customers acquired through our acquisition of sagem inc in may of with respect to temperature control  net sales for decreased by million to million 
net sales were unfavorable due to a combination of factors including a partial loss in business with a significant retail customer in  net sales including approximately million of pipeline orders for a new customer which did not repeat in  and distributors working off inventory left over from previous mild summer seasons 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased to in from in the improvement in gross margins reflects the return in to more normal production levels  as the aggressive and successful inventory reduction campaign in benefited  in both of our major segments 
engine management gross margins improved approximately percentage points  while temperature control improved approximately percentage points 
gross margins also benefited from a decrease in warranty returns in both engine management and temperature control 
overall  warranty returns improved by approximately percentage point  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million or of net sales in  from million or of net sales in the increase was primarily due to higher insurance and employee benefit costs 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of restructuring costs related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities within the temperature control segment 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead  will be subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
using the discounted cash flows method  based on our weighted average cost of capital and market multiples  we reviewed the fair values of each of our reporting units 
the decline in economic and market conditions  higher integration costs than anticipated and the general softness in the automotive aftermarket caused a decrease in the fair values of certain of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill as a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  or per diluted share during the first quarter of the impairment loss relates to goodwill pertaining to certain of our reporting units within our european segment and our temperature control segment for which we recorded charges of million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our review of goodwill for potential impairment 
after giving consideration to losses in europe and budgeted losses  we wrote off approximately million of the remaining goodwill associated with the engine management reporting unit of the european segment 
with respect to the european segment  approximately million of goodwill remains on the december  balance sheet  all of which pertains to the temperature control reporting unit 
other income 
other income  net increased approximately million over contributing to the increase was the elimination of fees related to an accounts receivable sales arrangement eliminated in april of interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million  as compared to contributing to overall decrease was lower borrowings during total debt was reduced approximately million and lower interest rates 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections statement no 

statement no 
eliminates the automatic classification of gain or loss on extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item of income and requires that such gain or loss be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of accounting principles board apb no 
 reporting results of operations apb no 

as a result  we reclassified the million extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt recorded in to interest expense 
income taxes 
the overall effective tax rate increased from in to in the significant increase is primarily the result of the operating losses in our european segment  for which no income tax benefit has been recorded because it is more likely than not that such benefit will not be realized in the near future 
supplementing the effect europe had on the effective rate is the increase in the company s domestic earnings as a percentage of overall earnings before taxes 
loss on discontinued operations 
loss on discontinued operations reflect the charges associated with asbestos  including legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
based on the information contained in the september actuarial study  which estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million  and all other available information considered by us  and as further set forth in such note  we recorded an after tax charge of million as a loss from discontinued operation during the third quarter of to reflect such liability 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
total legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters totaled million in impact of inflation although inflation is not a significant issue  management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings through cost reduction programs  including the sale of manufactured products  and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
recently  prices of steel and other commodities have risen 
these increases did not have a material impact on us as we are not dependent on any single commodity  however there can be no assurance over the long term 
future results of operations we continue to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins we are continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to million in and million in the reduction in was primarily attributable to lower earnings from continuing operations  a decrease in accounts payable and a lower decrease in inventory in  as compared to the improvement in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to improved earnings from continuing operations  higher accounts payable and continued reductions in inventory 
inventory reductions continue to be a focus of management 
for the year ended december   inventory decreased by an additional million over the million reduction in  which resulted primarily from reduced production and purchases  and where needed  the temporary closing of manufacturing facilities 
inventory turnover was x in  x in and x in inventory turnover should improve as dem is integrated  and inventory build ups needed to ensure order fulfillment are reduced as dem is effectively integrated 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase during was primarily due to the acquisition of dem as discussed more fully in note the increase during was primarily due to acquisitions  partially offset by decreases in capital expenditures 
assets acquired consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  receivables and inventory 
all acquisitions were financed with funds provided from our secondary equity offering  revolving credit facility and seller financing 
in january  we acquired the assets of a temperature control business from hartle industries for million 
the assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in april  we acquired carol cable limited  a manufacturer and distributor of wire sets based in the united kingdom  for approximately million 
the assets from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in addition  during  the company paid approximately an additional million for the remaining equity interest in smp holdings limited 
in may  we purchased the aftermarket fuel injector business of sagem inc  a subsidiary of johnson controls  for million 
sagem inc is a basic manufacturer of fuel injectors and was our primary supplier prior to the acquisition 
assets acquired from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase was partially financed by the seller million to be paid over a two year period  with the remaining funds being provided under our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures for the three most recent fiscal years ended december totaled million in  million in and million in financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities primarily for the acquisition of dem for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  and million in dividends paid for the three most recent fiscal years ended december were million in  million in and million in the decreased borrowings in and reflected our focus on reducing capital employed in the business 
effective april   we entered into an agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
the term of the credit agreement was for a period of five years and provided for a line of credit up to million 
on june  we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility to provide for an additional million commitment  in connection with our acquisition of dem 
this additional commitment increases the total amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to million from million  which now expires in availability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets  and includes the purchased assets of dem 
we expect such availability under the revolving credit facility  following the initial draw down at the acquisition closing  to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and integration costs 
direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined or the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  at our option 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of our domestic and canadian subsidiaries 
our revolving credit facility prior to the dem acquisition provided for certain financial covenants limiting our capital expenditures and requiring us to maintain a certain tangible net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter 
following our acquisition of dem  the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for  among other provisions  new financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of ebitda at the end of each fiscal quarter through december   commencing september   to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months through  and to limit capital expenditure levels for each fiscal year through in addition  in order to facilitate the aggregate financing of the acquisition  we completed a public equity offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and issued to dana corporation  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
in connection with our acquisition of dem  we issued to dana corporation an unsecured subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
the promissory note bears an interest rate of per annum for the first year  with such interest rate increasing by one half of a percentage point on each anniversary of the date of issuance 
accrued and unpaid interest is due quarterly under the promissory note 
the maturity date of the promissory note is five and a half years from the date of issuance 
the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty 
on june   we borrowed million under a mortgage loan agreement 
the loan is payable in monthly installments 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of maturing in july the mortgage loan is secured by a building and related property 
our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to the sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
our working capital is further being impacted by restructuring and integration costs  as well as inventory build ups necessary to ensure order fulfillment during the dem integration 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our near term needs 
in october  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
in july  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt under the revolving credit facility to a fixed rate  without exchanging the notional amounts 
at december   we had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million  one of which matured in january and one of which is scheduled to mature in january under these agreements  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and on a notional amount of million matured in january 
if  at any time  the swaps are determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreements  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective will be recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
on july   we issued our convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to prepay an senior note  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of our common stock 
during the years through  the board of directors authorized multiple repurchase programs under which we could repurchase shares of our common stock 
during such years  million in the aggregate of common stock has been repurchased to meet present and future requirements of our stock option programs and to fund our employee stock option plan esop 
as of december   we have board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
during  and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
the following is a summary of our contractual commitments  inclusive of our acquisition of dem  as of december  in thousands thereafter total principal payments of long term debt    operating leases        interest rate swap agreements severance payments related to restructuring   total commitments 
       the table above excludes approximately million of severance expected to be paid in after the dem facilities are closed 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated annual financial statements on this annual report on form k 
preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to customers 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
with respect to goodwill  we test for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
retirement and postretirement medical benefits 
each year we calculated the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas and sfas the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
a september actuarial study estimated a liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as is our accounting policy  the actuarial study was updated as of august  using methodologies consistent with the september study 
the updated study has estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from to million for the period through we continue to believe that no amount within the range was a better estimate after the updated study  therefore  no adjustment was recorded as our consolidated balance sheet at september  reflects a total liability of approximately million 
legal costs  which are expensed as incurred  are estimated to range from to million during the same period 
we plan on performing a similar annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will reassess the recorded liability  and if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operations 
legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters are expensed as incurred and recorded as a loss from discontinued operations in the statement of operations 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
we are evaluating the impact of applying fin r to existing vies in which it has variable interests and has not yet completed this analysis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
as of december   our financial instruments which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
in july  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt under the revolving credit facility to a fixed rate  without exchanging the notional amounts 
at december   we had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million  one of which matured in january and one of which is scheduled to mature in january under these agreements  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and on a notional amount of million matured in january 
if  at any time  the swaps are determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreements  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective will be recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was at december  and depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
