item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and have been impacted by a number of significant trends and events 
results of operations for compared to have been positively impacted by the acquisition of the capital stock of consolidated engineering services  inc ces from archstone smith operating trust and others on december   and an increase in revenues and income generated by united states facilities services operations and united states transportation infrastructure work 
however  the results compared to were negatively impacted by poor performance in the united kingdom construction operations  increased competition for  and a related decrease in gross profit margin on  commercial and industrial work in the united states inasmuch as there has been a continuing decline in commercial and industrial work in the united states resulting from the economic recession  reduced private sector spending on small and discretionary projects and repairs and maintenance work resulting from the economic recession  an increase in the percentage of work relating to public sector construction that typically has lower gross profit margins than private sector work  lower than historical gross profit margins on several united states projects as a result of poor contract performance  and reduced labor productivity due to the uncertain job market 
the foregoing factors affecting the united states subsidiaries are hereafter referred to collectively as the unfavorable united states market conditions 
the results of operations compared to were positively impacted by the acquisition on march  of a group of companies the acquired comfort companies from comfort systems usa  inc comfort and increased revenues and income from transportation infrastructure work and facilities services contracts 
the results of operations for compared to were negatively impacted  as described above with respect to  by the economic recession  the beginning of a negative trend in the performance on emcor s united kingdom construction projects  a reduction in fast track projects ie those projects with timetables more accelerated than typical contracts for similar projects for telecom work and other work in the united states  and a shift to public sector work in the united states which typically results in revenues being recognized over a longer period of time 
emcor s management recognizes that some of the business challenges it faces are endemic to the construction and facilities services industry 
however  emcor has made or has under consideration certain strategic changes with respect to its geographic markets and sectors served  including a shift in focus toward more private sector commercial work even if that causes a temporary reduction in revenues until such construction spending increases significantly 
actions already taken include the replacement of the senior management of the united kingdom operations and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses in all segments 
such selling  general and administrative expense reductions are expected to continue in emcor expects the demand for hvac repair and maintenance services to increase starting in the second quarter of  and emcor will continue to follow its long term strategy of increasing revenues from multi year facilities services contracts 
emcor s management believes it has positioned the company to benefit from its strategy  however  there is no guarantee that these strategies will result in significantly improved results if economic conditions affecting emcor and the construction industry generally do not improve 
highlights revenues for the year ended december  were billion  compared to billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income was million for compared to million for and million for diluted earnings per share on net income were per share for compared to per share for and per share for the consolidated results of operations for emcor for the year ended december  include the results of operations of the acquired comfort companies and ces from their respective dates of acquisition 
emcor acquired two additional companies during each of the years and see note c acquisitions of businesses of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions 
operating segments emcor has the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design  integration  installation  startup  operation and maintenance of various systems a united states electrical construction and facilities services involving systems for generation and distribution of electrical power  lighting systems  low voltage systems such as fire alarm  security  communications and process control systems and voice and data systems  b united states mechanical construction and facilities services involving systems for heating  ventilation  air conditioning  refrigeration  and clean room ventilation systems  and plumbing  process and high purity piping systems  c united states facilities services  d canada construction and facilities services  e united kingdom construction and facilities services  and f other international construction and facilities services 
the segment united states facilities services principally consists of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of customers facilities mobile operation and maintenance services  site based operation and maintenance services  facility planning and consulting services and energy management programs which services are not related to customers construction programs 
the canada  united kingdom and other international segments perform electrical construction  mechanical construction and facilities services 
other international construction and facilities services represents emcor s operations outside of the united states  canada and the united kingdom primarily in south africa and the middle east during the periods presented 
application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
emcor s significant accounting policies are described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
there was no initial adoption of any accounting policies during other than those listed under new accounting pronouncements below 
emcor believes that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect the financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to a revenue recognition from i long term construction contracts for which the percentage of completion method of accounting is used and ii services contracts  b collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable  c insurance liabilities  d income taxes and e intangible assets 
revenue recognition from long term construction contracts and services contracts emcor believes its most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long term construction contracts for which emcor uses the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term contracts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and  accordingly  the method used for revenue recognition within emcor s industry 
percentage of completion for each contract is measured principally by the ratio of costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total costs to perform such contract at completion 
certain of emcor s electrical contracting business units measure percentage of completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date to perform each contract to the estimated total labor costs to perform such contract at completion 
provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in emcor s consolidated balance sheets 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of a contract 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts emcor seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs 
such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect the ability to bill and collect amounts billed 
as of december  and  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included unbilled revenues for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and for claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  accounts receivable as of december  and include claims and contractually billed amounts related to such contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
generally  contractually billed amounts will not be paid by the customer to emcor until final resolution of related claims 
due to uncertainties inherent in estimates employed in applying percentage of completion accounting  estimates may be revised as project work progresses 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of revised estimates be reported prospectively in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to revenue recognition for long term construction contracts  emcor recognizes revenues from services contracts as such contracts are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated sab 
there are two basic types of services contracts fixed price services contracts which are signed in advance for maintenance  repair and retrofit work over periods typically ranging from one to three years for which there may be emcor employees on a customer s site full time and services contracts which may or may not be signed in advance for similar maintenance  repair and retrofit work on an as needed basis frequently referred to as time and material work 
fixed price services contracts are generally performed evenly over the contract period  and  accordingly  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract 
revenues derived from other services contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with sab expenses related to all services contracts are recognized as incurred 
accounts receivable emcor is required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables  which assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer  emcor s prior collection history with the customer and related aging of the past due balances 
the provisions for bad debts during   and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increased provision of million for compared to primarily relates to the potential non payment of a customer account receivable of approximately million due to the publicly reported financial difficulties of the customer 
at december  and  accounts receivable of  million and million  respectively  included allowances of million and million  respectively 
specific accounts receivable are evaluated when emcor believes a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition or credit ratings or its bankruptcy 
the allowance requirements are based on the best facts available and are re evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis and as additional information is received 
insurance liabilities emcor has deductibles for certain workers compensation  auto liability  general liability and property claims  has self insured retentions for certain other casualty claims  and is self insured for employee related health care claims 
losses are recorded based upon estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the liabilities are derived from known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of these obligations 
emcor believes its liabilities for these obligations are adequate 
however  such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors  including severity of injury  determination of liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
income taxes emcor has net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets was approximately million and million  respectively 
intangible assets as of december   emcor had goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets primarily the market value of its backlog  customer relationships and trademarks and tradenames of million and million  respectively  arising out of the acquisition of companies 
the determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment  on at least an annual basis  and be written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances 
as of december   no indicators of impairment of its goodwill or identifiable intangible assets resulted from emcor s annual impairment review  which was performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas see note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the provisions of sfas discussion and analysis of results of operations the reportable segments reflect  in all years presented  reclassifications of certain business units among the segments due to changes in emcor s internal reporting structure 
revenues as described below in more detail  revenues for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion for the million increase in revenues for when compared to was primarily due to revenues of million from companies acquired in and and to increased revenues in the united states electrical construction and facilities services and united states facilities services segments excluding acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
the increases in revenues were partially offset by decreased revenues for the united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment excluding acquisitions 
revenues for of billion represented a increase over revenues of billion for this million increase in revenues for compared to was primarily due to revenues of million from companies acquired in and to increased revenues related to site based facilities services contracts and power generation projects 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction  when compared to  of revenues related to fast track telecom and other commercial contracts  as well as a shift to longer term projects which typically result in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time 
the following table presents emcor s revenues by operating segment and the approximate percentages of total revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of total total total revenues united states electrical construction and facilities services    united states mechanical construction and facilities services    united states facilities services total united states operations    canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services total worldwide operations    revenues for emcor s united states electrical construction and facilities services segment for increased by million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in transportation infrastructure and energy generation work  partially offset by a significant decline in private sector commercial work  which include offices  manufacturing facilities and hotels 
compared to  the new york city area market in experienced the largest reduction in revenues from commercial work  however  this decline in revenues was offset by increased public sector work in the washington d 
c area market  increased transportation infrastructure work in the denver area and increased power generation and transportation infrastructure work in california 
the million decrease in revenues attributable to this segment compared to was primarily due to a reduction during in fast track telecom and other commercial work 
during  transportation infrastructure work increased and power generation work remained steady compared to the prior year 
united states mechanical construction and facilities services revenues increased million for compared to revenues for compared to increased in the education and institutional sectors  partially offset by significantly decreased commercial office  manufacturing and power generation work 
in  emcor s mid western markets were particularly negatively impacted by a reduction in outage upgrade and replacement work at manufacturing facilities 
in addition  revenues were negatively impacted by declines in small and discretionary projects and repairs and maintenance work caused largely by the cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states 
the million increase in revenues for compared to was primarily attributable to million of revenues from the acquired comfort companies and increased revenues from power generation work in the northern california market 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues as a result of the performance of fewer fast track contracts  particularly in the telecom sector 
united states facilities services revenues  which include those operations that principally provide consulting and maintenance services  increased by million for compared to the increase in revenues was primarily due to revenues of million attributable to the ces acquisition and an increase in site based facilities services contracts  partially offset by a decline in certain small and discretionary projects due to increased competition resulting in fewer projects awarded to emcor 
additionally  a reduction in demand for mobile services  which services had been adversely affected by cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states  contributed to a decrease in revenues 
revenues for increased by million compared to this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to business development activities resulting in an increase in the number of site based facilities services contracts and  to a lesser extent  to the acquisition of ces  partially offset by a decline in telecommunications related work 
revenues of canada construction and facilities services increased by million for as compared to the increase in revenues for was primarily attributable to an increase of million caused by a change in the rate of exchange for canadian dollars to united states dollars due to strengthening of the canadian dollar 
but for the exchange rates  revenues would have decreased due to a temporary scale back in work on certain long term power generation projects attributable to customer s project scheduling 
the million increase in revenues for compared to was primarily attributable to the performance of work on certain long term contracts 
united kingdom construction and facilities services revenues increased million for compared to principally due to an increase of million caused by a change in the rate of exchange for british pounds to united states dollars due to strengthening of the british pound 
as was the case in canada  but for exchange rates  revenues would have declined because of execution of a planned reduction in bidding for certain types of institutional and government sponsored construction projects 
the million increase in revenues compared to revenues was principally due to growth in the facilities services market  offsetting a decline in the overall construction market 
the decline in the overall construction market principally resulted in fewer attractive bid opportunities in  which caused emcor to be more selective in submitting project bids 
other international construction and facilities services revenues primarily consist of emcor s operations in the middle east  south africa and europe 
revenues from those operations were zero for  zero for and million for all of the and projects in these markets were performed by joint ventures 
the results of these joint venture operations are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because emcor has less than majority ownership in these joint ventures  is not subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the joint venture s activities and is not entitled to receive a majority of the joint venture s residual returns or both 
accordingly  revenues attributable to such joint ventures are not reflected as revenues in the consolidated financial statements 
in  certain european projects were performed entirely by emcor subsidiaries  and therefore  revenues were recorded 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in these markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents emcor s cost of sales  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages cost of sales    gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross profit decreased million for compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared with for gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to poor performance in the united kingdom construction market and the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above  this decline was offset in part by million of gross profit attributable to the companies acquired and their generally higher gross profit as a percentage of revenues than other emcor subsidiaries 
gross profit increased million for compared with  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to for compared to for the increase in gross profit was primarily due to gross profit of million earned by companies acquired in an increase in gross profit of million in compared to  which was attributable to emcor s other subsidiaries  was due to the type and location of construction and facilities services contracts performed  efficient deployment of local labor  effective procurement of materials and focus on risk management programs 
the increase in when compared to in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was principally attributable to the acquired comfort companies and their generally higher gross profit as a percentage of revenues than other emcor subsidiaries and  to a lesser extent  improvements in gross profit in emcor s other subsidiaries due to favorable job close outs 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents emcor s selling  general and administrative expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased million between and as a percentage of revenues  total selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in as compared to in for  selling  general and administrative expenses included amortization expense of million attributable to identifiable intangible assets associated with acquisitions compared to million for selling  general and administrative expenses excluding companies acquired in and and related amortization expense were approximately million of revenues for compared to million of revenues for  which decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable to a managed reduction of both variable expenses including reduced incentive compensation related to less favorable financial performance and reduction in personnel and fixed expenses such as building occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  total selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in as compared to in the increase in expenses and increase in expenses as a percentage of revenues during as compared to was primarily due to million of expenses attributable to companies acquired in and increased variable selling  general and administrative expenses of certain other emcor subsidiaries primarily incentive compensation related to more favorable financial performance  which increased expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in goodwill amortization expense as goodwill is no longer required to be amortized per sfas goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december   and was zero  zero and million  respectively 
operating income the following table presents emcor s operating income  and operating income as a percentage of segment revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of segment segment segment revenues revenues revenues operating income loss united states electrical construction and facilities services 
united states mechanical construction and facilities services 
united states facilities services total united states operations canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services corporate administration total worldwide operations other corporate items interest expense interest income income before taxes as described below in more detail  operating income decreased by million to million for compared to million for this decrease in was primarily attributable to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above  and operating losses from the united kingdom construction and facilities services segment 
operating income was favorably impacted by million  million and million reductions of insurance liabilities previously established for insurance exposures as a consequence of effective risk management and safety programs 
operating income increased by million to million for compared to million for this increase in was primarily attributable to million of operating income from acquisitions  increased transportation infrastructure and power generation construction work and the successful completion and settlement of several contracts 
operating income decreased for the united states electrical construction and facilities services operations for compared to the decrease in operating income for of million as compared to  and the related decrease as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above 
this decrease was partially offset by profitable performance of transportation infrastructure and certain power generation work 
in  the new york city area market was particularly adversely impacted by a significant decline in commercial work and by unprofitable performance of power generation work 
conversely  the washington  dc area market provided a consistent profitable revenue base  the denver area benefited from increased income from transportation infrastructure work and operations in california benefited from increased income from power generation  transportation infrastructure work and project close outs 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses excluding companies acquired decreased by approximately million in this segment for compared to this decrease was mostly related to a reduction in incentive compensation  which related to less favorable financial performance and reduction in personnel  and a reduction in other variable expenses 
operating income for for the united states electrical construction and facilities services operations increased million  or  from levels 
the increase in operating income  and operating income as a percentage of revenues  for versus was primarily attributable to increased transportation infrastructure work and continuing power generation construction work on the west coast  the successful completion and settlement of several contracts  and increased operating income attributable to various commercial and industrial projects in the san diego  las vegas  washington dc and denver markets  offset in part  by a reduction in fast track data center construction work across other markets 
united states mechanical construction and facilities services operating income decreased million for compared to this decrease in operating income and decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the unfavorable united states market conditions previously discussed in the overview above 
the mid western markets were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in work on manufacturing facilities  the western markets were negatively impacted by reduced income from power generation work and parts of the united states markets were negatively impacted by reduced repairs and maintenance work caused largely by the cooler than normal summer weather conditions 
this decrease in operating income was partially offset by increased income from water and wastewater treatment facilities projects for compared to in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million in this segment for compared to this decrease was mostly related to a reduction in incentive compensation related to less favorable financial performance and reduction in personnel and reduction in other variable expenses 
operating income for compared to increased million  and as a percentage of revenues increased to from  primarily due to i operating income of million from the acquired comfort companies  ii operating income associated with power generation construction work in the northern california market and iii improved results at the poole kent subsidiary operations which had losses in the increases were partially offset by reduced operating income attributable to fewer fast track projects in the than united states facilities services operating income increased by million for compared with the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to income of million from the ces acquisition and an increase in the number of site based facilities services contracts resulting from business development activities 
the increase was partially offset by reduced income from certain small and discretionary projects due to increased competition and from mobile services  which services were adversely affected by cooler than normal summer weather conditions in parts of the united states 
operating income of million in this segment for compared to operating losses of million for increased by million primarily due to new facilities services contracts and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as the facilities services operations became more established and required less spending related to the development of new business 
canada construction and facilities services operating income decreased by million in compared to this decrease was principally due to a increased hospital and school construction projects and less manufacturing outage work  since hospital and school construction projects generally had lower gross profits than the manufacturing outage work performed in  b decreased profit from several longer term power generation projects compared with the prior year and c million of an increase in operating income relating to the change in exchange rates due to strengthening of the canadian dollar 
for compared to  operating income increased by million principally due to increased work on longer term contracts that result in profit recognition over an extended time period  partially offset by a reduction in the number of fast track type contracts 
united kingdom construction and facilities services operating income decreased by million to a reported operating loss in compared to the operating loss was primarily attributable to net unfavorable settlements and closeouts of certain construction projects completed during the year  increased bad debt expense of million in primarily related to the potential non payment of a large customer account receivable due to publicly reported financial difficulties  reorganization expenses of approximately million related to employee severance expenses and the closing of several offices and million relating to the change in exchange rates due to strengthening of the british pound 
for  operating income decreased by million as compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable settlements and closeouts of certain construction projects completed during the year 
other international construction and facilities services operating income was million for compared to operating losses of million and million in and  respectively 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern  south african and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
general corporate expenses for increased by million from levels  and increased in by million from levels 
the increase in general corporate expenses for compared with was primarily related to an increase in personnel required to support the business growth related to acquisitions and increased marketing expenses associated with emcor s brand awareness campaign  which promotes the emcor brand on the national and local level in the united states and targets non traditional buyers of emcor services such as chief executive and chief financial officers of companies 
the increase for compared with was due to the expansion of operations support activities such as information technology infrastructure  human resources and marketing 
interest expense increased by million for compared to due to increased borrowing under emcor s revolving credit facility 
interest expense decreased by million in compared to principally due to the conversion of million of emcor s convertible subordinated notes into approximately million shares of emcor common stock in the second quarter of interest income decreased by million in compared to due to repayment of increased borrowings for working capital under the revolving credit facility 
interest income decreased by million in compared with  which decrease was due to a reduction in cash on hand in related to cash used for acquisitions and repayment of borrowings related to the acquisitions and to lower interest rates earned 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents emcor s net cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december  and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities the company s consolidated cash balance decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for was million  a decrease of million from net cash provided by operating activities of million for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to decreased net income  decreased accrued expenses  increased accounts receivable and increased contracts in progress  net  offset by increased accounts payable 
the changes in these accounts in  and the related decrease in net cash provided by operating activities  are a result of emcor s shift in work toward more public sector work and less small and discretionary projects 
the increase in public sector work  which typically involves larger projects  lower gross profit margins and more capital than private sector work  was the primary reason for the decrease  the decrease was also due to reduced higher margin small and discretionary projects that requires much less upfront cash than large construction projects 
net cash used in investing activities in of million consisted primarily of payments of an aggregate of million for acquisitions in and earn out payments of million for acquisitions in prior periods  net disbursements for other investments of million and million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by million of payments received pursuant to indemnity provisions of acquisition agreements 
this activity compares to net cash used in investing activities for  which consists primarily of aggregate payments of million for acquisitions in and earn out payments of million for acquisitions from prior periods  net disbursements for other investments of million and million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for of million was primarily attributable to net borrowings under working capital credit lines of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  offset by repayments of long term debt of million 
the following is a summary of emcor s material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments in millions payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum funding requirement for pension plan open purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total less other commercial amounts than after commitments committed year years years years revolving credit facility letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments represent open purchase orders for material and subcontracting costs related to the company s construction and service contracts 
these purchase orders are not reflected in emcor s consolidated balance sheet and should not impact future cash flows as amounts will be recovered through customer billings 
represent primarily insurance related liabilities  the timing for which payments beyond one year is not practical to estimate 
emcor classifies these borrowings as short term on its consolidated balance sheet because of emcor s intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
on september   emcor entered into a million five year revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility 
effective july   emcor increased its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million 
the revolving credit facility  which replaced a credit facility entered into on december   is guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of emcor  is secured by substantially all of the assets of emcor and most of its subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the fee ranges from to of the unused amount  based on certain financial tests 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris nesbitt from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests  united states dollar libor at december  the rate was plus to  based on certain financial tests or british pound libor at december  the rate was plus to  based on certain financial tests 
the interest rates in effect at december  were  and for the prime commercial lending rate  united states dollar libor and british pound libor  respectively 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
as of december  and  emcor had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
emcor had borrowings of million and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
in august  the company s canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  renewed a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or a subsidiary of emcor has guaranteed indebtedness of a venture in which it has a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on emcor s financial position or results of operations 
each of the venturers is jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million borrowing due december during september  each venture partner contributed equity to the venture  of which emcor s contribution was million 
emcor is contingently liable to sureties in respect of performance and payment bonds issued by sureties  usually at the request of customers in connection with construction projects which secure emcor payment and performance obligations under contracts for such projects 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain emcor employees  bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
emcor bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   sureties had issued bonds for the account of emcor in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
the bonds are issued by emcor s sureties in return for a premium which varies depending on the size and type of the bonds 
the largest individual bond is approximately million 
emcor has agreed to indemnify the sureties for any payments made by them in respect of bonds issued on emcor s behalf 
on march   emcor sold  pursuant to an underwritten public offering  million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
during the second quarter of  emcor called its convertible subordinated notes for redemption 
as a consequence  all of the convertible subordinated notes were converted into approximately million shares of emcor common stock 
emcor does not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
the primary source of liquidity for emcor has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
emcor also maintains the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable emcor to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
emcor may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an effect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  emcor s focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns as the facilities services market is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction market 
the acquisition in december of ces  which is primarily focused on the facilities services market  is part of emcor s plan to grow its facilities services business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the through period  there are typically fewer small and discretionary projects from the private sector and companies such as emcor more aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically require working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while emcor strives to maintain a net over billed position with its customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
emcor s net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility  and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon emcor s current credit ratings and financial position  emcor can reasonably expect to be able to issue long term debt instruments and or equity 
over the long term  emcor s primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in order to provide protection against declines in demands for private sector construction services  emcor has increased its participation  and its backlog of contracts  in the public sector and in the facilities services market 
in addition to the primary revenue risk factor  emcor s ability to perform work at profitable levels is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
emcor believes that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  emcor is a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from it amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if emcor was required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december   emcor utilized approximately million of letters of credit issued pursuant to its revolving credit facility as collateral for its insurance obligations

 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin 
fin expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes in which the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders  the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests  and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  except for special purpose entities for which the effective date is periods ending after december

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk emcor has not used derivative financial instruments for any purpose during the years ended december  and  including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates  or commodity prices of materials used in its business 
emcor is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under that facility bear interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this borrowing is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the facility  and these borrowings bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris nesbitt from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or british pound libor at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests 
based on the borrowings outstanding of million  if the overall interest rates were to increase by  the net of tax interest expense would increase approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if the overall interest rates were to decrease by  interest expense would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
the revolving credit facility expires in september there is no guarantee that emcor will be able to renew the facility at its expiration 
emcor is also exposed to market risk and the market s potential related impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions 
emcor continually monitors the credit worthiness of its customers and maintains on going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to change orders and billing terms 
therefore  emcor believes it takes appropriate action to manage market and other risks  but there is no assurance that it will be able to reasonably identify all risks with respect to collectibility of these assets 
see also the previous discussion of accounts receivable under the heading application of critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
amounts invested in emcor s foreign operations are translated into u 
s 
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  in its consolidated balance sheets 
emcor believes the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on its consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in their same local currencies
