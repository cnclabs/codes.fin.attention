item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  below 
types of contracts while the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably  generally we perform our work under two groups of contracts cost reimbursable  and guaranteed maximum and fixed price contracts 
as of december   the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog backlog in millions cost reimbursable guaranteed maximum and fixed price under cost reimbursable contracts  the client reimburses our costs in developing a project and pays us a pre determined fee or a fee based upon a percentage of the costs incurred in completing the project 
our profit may be in the form of a fee  a simple mark up applied to labor costs incurred in the contract  or a combination of the two 
the fee element may also vary 
the fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors  milestones or targets  it may be a fixed amount in the contract  or it may be based upon a percentage of the costs incurred 
guaranteed maximum price contracts or gmax contracts are performed in a manner similar to cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price 
we can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price 
where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price  we will receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client 
fixed price contacts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum contracts 
under negotiated fixed price contracts  we are selected as contractor first  and then we negotiate price with the client 
these types of contracts generally occur where we commence work before a final price is agreed upon 
under lump sum contracts  we bid on a contract based upon specifications provided by the client against competitors  agreeing to develop a project at a fixed price 
another type of fixed price contract is a so called unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every unit of work performed 
in some fixed price contracts  we can benefit from some of the savings depending upon whether the client is willing to bear some 
table of contents of the risk if the actual cost exceeds the contract award 
as a result  if we perform well  we can benefit from cost savings  however  if the project does not proceed as originally planned  we cannot recover for cost overruns except in certain limited situations 
under most lump sum contracts  however  because the price paid by the client is not subject to any adjustment based upon changes to the actual cost of the project  while we benefit from all cost savings  we also bear the risk of cost overruns 
thus  these types of contracts can offer greater profit potential if cost savings are realized but also contain more inherent risk 
our government segment  as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of united states government programs  generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts although subject to applicable statutes and regulations 
in many cases  these contracts include incentive fee arrangements 
the programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts 
despite the fact that these programs are generally awarded on a multi year basis  the funding for the programs is generally approved on an annual basis by congress 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  or funds for a program may even be eliminated thereby significantly curtailing or stopping a program 
some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity agreements 
under these arrangements  we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend 
while the scope is often not initially fully defined or require any specific amount of work  once the project scope is determined  additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding 
contracts and business with the government are also subject to a number of socio economic and other requirements as well as certain procurement regulations 
if a contractor fails to comply with the requirements and regulations  it could lead to suspension or even debarment from government contracting 
finally  government contracting and the continued funding of programs is also subject to a variety of factors beyond our control such as political developments both domestically and internationally  budget considerations and changes in procurement policies 
thus  many of our government contracts can be terminated at the discretion of the government generally with payment of compensation only for work and commitments made at the time of termination  along with an allowance for profit for work performed 
competition we are one of the world s larger providers of engineering  procurement and construction services 
the markets served by our business are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources  particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of companies are competing in the markets served by the business  including the bechtel group  inc  the shaw group  jacobs engineering group  kellogg brown root  washington group international and foster wheeler corp 
in the engineering and construction arena  our competition is primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
our engineering  procurement and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity  reputation for quality  technology  cost effectiveness  worldwide procurement capability  project management expertise  geographic coverage and ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis  ability to execute projects of varying sizes  strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies 
the various markets served by the global services segment  while containing some similarities  tend also to have discrete issues particularly impacting that unit 
each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets 
in the equipment sector  which operates in numerous markets  the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and very competitive  with most competitors operating in specific geographic areas 
the competition for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment  tool and management services 
temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over  companies competing nationally 
the key competitive factors in this business line are price  service  quality  breadth of service  and the ability to retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage 
the barriers to entry in operations and maintenance are both financially and logistically 
table of contents low with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant 
competition is generally driven by reputation  price and the capacity to perform 
key competitive factors in our government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
raw materials raw materials and the components necessary for the conduct of our businesses are generally available from numerous sources 
we do not foresee any unavailability of raw materials and components that would have a material adverse effect on our businesses in the near term 
research and development while we engage in research and development efforts both on current projects and in the development of new products and services  during the past three fiscal years  we have not incurred costs for company sponsored research and development activities which would be material  special or unusual in any of our business segments 
environmental  safety and health matters we believe  based upon present information available to us  that our accruals with respect to future environmental costs are adequate and any future costs will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
some factors  however could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures 
these include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes regarding site cleanup costs or the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified 
number of employees the following table sets forth the number of employees of fluor and its subsidiaries engaged in our continuing business segments as of december  total employees oil gas industrial infrastructure government global services power other total with respect to our total number of employees  as of december  we had approximately  salaried employees and  craft and hourly employees 
the number of craft and hourly employees varies in relation to the number and size of projects we have in process at any particular time 
in addition  during fiscal  we had a reduction in the amount of direct hire hourly work which has resulted in a decrease in employment

company risk factors we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately of the dollar value of our contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
we conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements 
in terms of dollar value  the majority of our contracts allocate the risk of cost overruns to our client by requiring our client to reimburse us for our costs 
approximately of the dollar value of our contracts  however  are guaranteed maximum or lump sum contracts  where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  or circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
as of december   our backlog was approximately billion 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
for example  during our third quarter in fiscal  three projects totaling approximately million were removed from our backlog 
one of the projects was cancelled and removed from our backlog as a result of financing difficulties  the other two projects were cancelled and removed from backlog as a result of our strategic decision to exit a particular market 
these types of backlog reductions adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive 
if we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project  we could incur additional costs to cover our guarantee obligations 
in some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
we sometimes provide that the project  when completed  will also achieve certain performance standards 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay or the costs to cause the project to achieve the performance standards 
in some cases  where we fail to meet performance standards  we may also be subject to agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits 
we engage in engineering and construction activities for large industrial facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
any liability in excess of our insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us could result in significant liability claims against us  which claims may reduce our profits 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding our performance of project services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us 
if we were ultimately unable to collect on these payments  our profits would be reduced 
for example  in connection with disputes relating to our hamaca crude upgrader project  we had deferred approximately million of incurred costs  as of december  if we fail to obtain a favorable judgment or are unable to collect on 
table of contents any awards from a favorable judgment in connection with the hamaca disputes  our profits and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
the demand for our services and products is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
although downturns can impact our entire business  our telecommunications and mining markets exemplify businesses that are cyclical in nature and continue to be affected by a decrease in worldwide demand for the projects during the past year 
similarly  the power segment  which services the power industry  has seen strong growth in the past few years due to previously unmet power needs and deregulation but is now seeing its business opportunities decrease relative to the last few years 
industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in these industries 
we maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads 
if we do not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed  significant costs may result 
our estimates of future performance depend on  among other matters  whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards 
while our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment  these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that would have the effect of reducing our profits 
we have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties 
unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased costs and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control 
as of december   approximately of our projected backlog consisted of engineering and construction revenues to be derived from facilities to be constructed in other countries  we expect that a significant portion of our revenues and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  united states government policies  and international hostilities 
the lack of a well developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each such project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
our government contracts may be terminated at any time 
also  if we do not comply with restrictions and regulations imposed by the government  our government contracts may be terminated and we may be unable 
table of contents to enter into future government contracts 
the termination of our government contracts could significantly reduce our expected revenues 
we enter into significant government contracts  from time to time  such as those that we have with the us department of energy at fernald and hanford 
government contracts are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions and regulations  including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
we must comply with these government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping and accounting 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  and we could be temporarily suspended from government contracting or subcontracting 
if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason  or if we are suspended from government contract work  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues 
we also run the risk of the impact of government audits  investigations and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions which  if an unfavorable result occurs  could impact our profits and financial condition  as well as our ability to obtain future government work 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase our us dollar costs or reduce our us dollar revenues 
because our functional currency is the us dollar  we try to denominate our contracts in united states dollars 
however  from time to time our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies  which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our us dollar costs for  or reduce our us dollar revenues from  our foreign operations 
any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits 
intense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits 
we serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies  such as the bechtel group  inc  the shaw group  jacobs engineering group  kellogg brown root  washington group international and foster wheeler corp  compete 
in particular  the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment  technology and skilled personnel 
competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins 
intense competition is expected to continue in these markets  presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins 
if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits 
the success of our joint ventures depend on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we enter into various joint ventures as part of our engineering  procurement and construction businesses  such as ica fluor daniel  duke fluor daniel and project specific joint ventures 
the success of these and other joint ventures depend  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
if our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 

table of contents we could incur substantial tax liabilities if certain representations and warranties made by our predecessor in interest are inaccurate 
prior to the reverse spin off involving our former coal segment  our predecessor in interest received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the reverse spin off qualified as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the ruling was granted based upon certain representations made by our predecessor in interest 
while we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause those representations to be incorrect or incomplete  if those representations were inaccurate  it is possible that the ruling would no longer be valid 
in such event  we could incur a significant corporate tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose on us significant additional costs that reduce our profits 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations 
our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  past activities could also have a material impact on us 
for example  when we sold our mining business formerly conducted through st 
joe minerals corporation  we retained responsibility for certain non lead related environmental liabilities  but only to the extent that such liabilities were not covered by st 
joe s comprehensive general liability insurance 
while we are not currently aware of any material exposure arising from our former st 
joe s business or otherwise  the costs of complying with rulings and regulations or satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible could be substantial and could reduce our profits 
we are also subject to a number of asbestos related lawsuits 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our recent and any future acquisitions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to pursue select acquisitions of businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions will be successful 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we also may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
conversion of our outstanding convertible securities will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may issue  from time to time  securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock 
for example  we recently issued million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  which are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at the initial conversion price of 
the conversion of these and other of our convertible securities into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of these convertible securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of our convertible senior notes due 
table of contents could encourage short selling by market participants due to this dilution or to facilitate trading strategies involving the notes and our common stock 
item properties major facilities operations of fluor and its subsidiaries are conducted in both owned and leased properties totaling approximately million square feet

table of contents item legal proceedings fluor and its subsidiaries  as part of their normal business activities  are parties to a number of legal proceedings and other matters in various stages of development 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  in our opinion and based on reports of counsel  any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position  or the results of operations of the company  after giving effect to provisions already recorded 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in disputes with respect to the hamaca crude upgrader project located in jose  venezuela 
we are part of a joint venture which is actively proceeding on a number of issues under binding arbitration to recover certain costs we have incurred with respect to this project

for purposes of reviewing this document  operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  other non operating income and expense items  earnings or loss from discontinued operations  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company reports financial results on a calendar year basis for all periods subsequent to december  accounting pronouncements following is a discussion of the impact of recent accounting and financial reporting pronouncements that have been applied in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
this information is provided to assist in an understanding of the impact such changes have had on the company s financial reporting 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
under sfas  a component of a business that is held for sale is reported in discontinued operations if i the operations and cash flows will be  or have been  eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and  ii the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in such operations 
in the quarter ended september   the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  in september  the board of directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the company s construction equipment and temporary staffing businesses 
an active program to consummate such disposal was completed in with the disposition of the last remaining operation in the construction equipment business 
the operating results for discontinued operations are discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements were effective for the company s calendar year under the new rules  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
during  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and has determined that none of the goodwill is impaired 
application of the non amortization provisions resulted in an increase in earnings from continuing operations of million per diluted share in and compared with in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  application of this statement did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position in in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
disclosures required by the interpretation are provided below in the financial position and liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements 
the accounting requirements of the interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning january  application of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position in 
table of contents in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
certain of the company s engineering office facilities are leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities 
beginning in  the company now consolidates these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by fin r 
at december   the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of million and million in reported short term and long term debt  respectively  and an increase in property  plant and equipment of million 
none of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the company s obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting 
the cumulative impact of the difference in earnings  amounting to a charge of million net of tax  relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company may also use variable interest entities from time to time to facilitate financing of various projects 
there are no such financing entities in use at the present time 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards 
in april the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 amendments of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified and hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of the provisions of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts 
engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total

this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor costs and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   approximately percent of the company s backlog was cost reimbursable while approximately percent was for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues realized from the project 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated  costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  deferrals and revised project scope and costs  both upward and downward 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures 
certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues  costs and operating profits in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the power segment 
this segment includes duke fluor daniel and ica fluor daniel 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
frequently  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles 
foreign currency 
the company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in us dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred 
as a result  the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed 
under certain limited circumstances  such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives 
as of december   and  the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts 
managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies 
the company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure 
the objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in 
table of contents exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made 
as of december   and  the company did not have any significant forward exchange contracts 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 
in connection with the hamaca crude upgrader project located in jose  venezuela  the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the venezuelan bolivar compared with the us dollar 
see additional discussion concerning the hamaca project below under results of operations oil gas 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december  the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards  net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries  and certain project performance reserves 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
retirement benefits 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved  future funding obligations could increase substantially 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund approximately to million for the calendar year if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
results of operations summary of overall company results revenue declined percent in compared with primarily due to declines in the power and oil gas segments 
earnings from continuing operations increased percent to per share in compared with per share in the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to reduced corporate administrative and general expense and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 
lower segment operating profit  primarily in the power segment  and lower net interest income partially offset these improvements 
the company has experienced a significant decline in power segment revenue and earnings as most projects in the segment were completed and not replaced by new awards 
the decline in new awards in the power segment over the last two years reflects a cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction 
partially offsetting this trend in power is an increasing trend for new awards in the oil gas and government segments 
the company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years 
in addition  the trend for new awards in the government segment have increased due to awards for work in iraq as well as the completion of two niche acquisitions that improves the company s service offering to both the department of defense and department of state 
revenue increased percent in compared with primarily due to an increase in the oil gas segment 
earnings from continuing operations increased percent to per share in compared with 
table of contents per share in this increase is partially due to a net million per share charge for stock price driven compensation plan expense in due to the increase in stock price primarily in the first quarter of the year 
excluding the stock price charge  the increase in earnings from continuing operations in compared with was percent 
this increase is primarily due to significantly improved operating profit performance in the power segment as earnings were recognized on completed projects that were awarded in prior years 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared with in and in results in were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of per share and a loss of per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
results in and include losses from discontinued operations of per share and per share  respectively 
the results of discontinued operations is further discussed below 
the loss from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is discussed above under accounting pronouncements 
following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items 
the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance 
during the first quarter of  the company realigned certain operations to increase focus on the chemicals market 
projects in this market were formerly in the energy chemicals segment and will now be executed and reported in the industrial infrastructure segment 
the energy chemicals segment was renamed oil gas and all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
the company is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities  commercial and institutional buildings  mining  chemicals  telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities 
the government segment provides project management engineering  construction  and contingency response services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance  construction equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services 
the power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities 
services provided by the power segment are conducted through two joint ventures  duke fluor daniel  a percent owned partnership with duke energy  and ica fluor daniel  a percent owned joint venture with grupo ica  a mexican company 
the results of segment operations as reported herein have been conformed to the organizational alignment discussed above for all periods presented 
oil gas 
revenue in the oil gas segment amounted to billion for the year ended december  representing a decrease of percent over revenue for the year ended december  revenue for the period increased percent compared with the year ended december  the decrease in revenue during reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects 
the revenue increase in compared with reflects the increase in work performed on projects in the full execution stage compared with revenue primarily from front end studies and preliminary engineering in the period 
operating profit margin in the oil gas segment increased in to percent compared with percent in due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance 
operating profit margin in was lower than the percent that was achieved in due to the impact of projects moving to full execution from the higher margin front end studies and preliminary engineering work performed in a major ongoing project in the oil gas segment in is the hamaca crude upgrader project hamaca located in jose  venezuela 
hamaca is a billion lump sum project including million of approved change orders of grupo alvica ga  a joint venture including fluor daniel percent and inelectra ca percent  to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called petrolera ameriven pa including petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa  chevrontexaco and conocophillips 

table of contents the joint venture is actively pursuing two cost and schedule relief issues that were referred to arbitration in december the first is responsibility for costs arising from the site labor agreement for called acta convenio and the second relates to modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions 
the hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier labor agreement and the acta convenio were held in april the site soil conditions issue was the subject of hearings in november there are no monetary cross claims by pa in the arbitration 
events in venezuela including a national strike in early have had a significant impact on the progress of the project 
in accordance with the contract  the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike 
a change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of million was submitted by ga 
this action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in january a time schedule for the resolution of the claim will be established by the arbitration panel in the near future 
force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in october the arbitration panel  by procedural order dated january   has ordered pa to refrain from taking any action to seek liquidated delay damages  making claim against or drawing down on a letter of credit  terminating the contract with ga  or making any demands pursuant to any guarantee provisions in the contract  pending completion of the site soil conditions issues 
the award on the site soils conditions matter is anticipated in the near future 
the client has conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions and million of incurred costs has been paid 
the amount of the claim for site soil conditions is million including the million conditional payment 
the company is accounting for the additional costs incurred for the soil conditions matter as additional revenue as payments are received 
the amount of the claim for acta convenio is million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter 
incurred costs associated with acta convenio  soil conditions  the recent national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred 
these costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received 
as of december   incurred costs amounting to million have been deferred 
substantial additional costs are expected to be incurred as the project progresses and resolution of outstanding issues concerning the total amount to be awarded and schedule extensions are yet to be determined 
if costs relating to acta convenio  soil conditions  the recent national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable  the company could face reduced profits or losses on this project  along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings 
the project remains subject to future disruptions that could result in additional costs and claims 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in compared to billion in new project awards in include the tengizchevroil tco project  a major oil and gas development in kazakhstan 
the tco project was expected to be awarded in but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations  which were resolved early in also included in new awards in is the sakhalin i program and construction management project led by exxonmobil and a project for lukoil  a major russian oil company 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  a decline of percent over the decline was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the tco project 
the large size and uncertain timing of complex  international projects can create variability in the segment s award pattern  consequently  future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty 
backlog for the oil gas segment increased to billion at december  compared with billion at december  this increase is due to the higher level of new awards in and the lower level of work performed on these new awards as they are in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning 
backlog declined to billion at december  compared with billion at december  the decline in backlog primarily is the result of the temporary suspension in of the tco project that was awarded in early as discussed above 
industrial infrastructure 
the industrial infrastructure segment had revenues of billion for the year ended december   an percent increase compared with the previous year 
this increase primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in 
table of contents and not replaced with new awards 
the industrial infrastructure segment had revenues of billion for the year ended december  essentially flat with the revenues for the year ended december  operating profit for the segment was impacted in both and by provisions relating to projects awarded in previous years 
in operating profit was negatively impacted by a pre tax provision of million relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in australia 
the investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client where the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the client s capital stock 
due to funding considerations  continued development of the project was suspended resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection 
because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution 
a pre tax million dispute resolution provision in primarily relates to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on the verde gold project in chile  a gold ore processing facility completed in during the second quarter of  the company recognized a loss provision of million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest  less a million reserve provided in prior years 
the company anticipates recovering a portion of the award from available insurance and has recorded million in expected insurance recoveries 
the net impact on results of operations for was a charge of million 
the operating profit margin in the industrial infrastructure segment was essentially flat with these results are substantially below results achieved in primarily due to the provisions discussed above 
in margins were also lower due to the increased volume of construction management work and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed below 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion compared with billion in new awards in included a substantial award for the sh toll road project in texas 
in addition  new awards in were lower than and due to continuing economic weakness in the mining  telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries 
backlog for the industrial infrastructure segment declined to billion compared with billion at december  contributing to this decline was the removal of million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years 
one of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing 
the other two were commercial projects that the company decided to not execute due to evolving changes in industry liability 
the increase in backlog to billion at december  compared with billion as of december  reflects the strong increase particularly in life sciences and transportation awards in government 
the government segment had revenues of billion for the year ended december  compared with revenue of billion in this percent increase is primarily due to the substantial increase in work performed for the department of defense on the midcourse missile defense test bed facilities in alaska  the department of state for an embassy project in brazil and new awards for task orders in iraq 
also contributing to the increase was revenue from del jen which was acquired early in government segment revenue in increased percent over revenue for the year ended december  the revenue increase in primarily reflects higher activity levels on projects being executed for the department of energy doe 
revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration  engineering  construction  site operations and maintenance services at two major doe sites the fernald environmental management project in ohio and the hanford environmental management project in washington 
operating profit margin for the government segment declined to percent in compared with percent in contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal activity during the year as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities 
the operating profit margin of percent in compares with percent in this improvement is attributable to improved project execution and realization of performance incentives on the doe contracts  activity on the midcourse missile defense test bed facilities in alaska and increased logistical support activities internationally 
in addition  good performance on the fernald contract led to a re baselining of the project  which favorably impacted operating profit in and the last half of many projects performed on behalf of us government 
table of contents clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months 
in january  the company acquired del jen  inc del jen  a leading provider of services to the departments of defense and labor 
the acquisition will expand the company s ability to provide services in the government outsourcing market 
del jen was acquired for million in cash of which million was recognized as goodwill and million was recognized as intangible assets 
in november  the company acquired the international division of ja jones construction company ja jones  which provides design build and construction services to the us government 
this acquisition will further expand the company s portfolio of government business 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
total assets in the government segment increased to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of del jen with total assets of million at december  in addition  the segment has unbilled fees totaling million related to the fernald project 
the project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in deferred fees recognized in revenue in and were million and million  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to work performed in the middle east 
global services 
the global services segment had revenues of billion for the year ended december   up percent compared with the year ended december  revenue for was percent lower than revenue for the year ended december  the increase in revenue in is partially due to the acquisition of plant performance services ps at the end of the first quarter 
the revenue decline in compared with primarily reflects the impact of increased selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector 
operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent compared with percent in and percent in the reduced margin in is partially attributable to lower contribution from ps and construction related services reflecting the lower volume in power and oil gas activities 
the improvement in compared with the prior period is primarily attributable to the procurement services business which incurred substantial amounts of development and start up expenses in in march  the company acquired five specialty operations and maintenance o m business groups from philip services corporation 
the acquired businesses  which were named plant performance services ps  will expand and strengthen the o m services business component of the global services segment and complement the company s core engineering  procurement and construction business 
the business groups were acquired for million in cash which excluded working capital 
during the period from the date of acquisition through december   approximately million of working capital has been provided to the business to fund operations 
as of december   the allocation of the purchase price has not been finalized pending valuation of assets acquired through independent appraisals 
new awards in the global services segment for operations and maintenance projects were billion  an increase of percent over this increase is primarily due to the contribution from ps 
the percent decline in new awards in compared with is primarily attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector 
backlog for the global services segment has been fairly stable at billion at december  compared with billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
this relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships 
the equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue 
accordingly  new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only 

table of contents power 
the power segment experienced a significant decline in revenue to million for the year ended december   compared with billion in and billion in this decline is due to the substantial work off of nearly all projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years 
as mentioned previously  the segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last two years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity 
operating profit margin in the power segment was a very strong percent for the year ended december   compared with percent in and percent in the strong performance in is attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects 
projects in the power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
on july   the company jointly announced with duke energy corporation the decision to terminate the duke fluor daniel partnership d fd as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants 
a joint plan among the partners is being developed to dissolve the business over the next two years 
the dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company 
the company will continue to identify power generation opportunities and any prospective projects will be performed percent by fluor 
new awards in the power segment were down substantially to million for the year ended december   compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
the majority of new awards in will be executed by fluor or ica fluor daniel 
backlog for the power segment decreased to million at december  compared with million and billion at december  and  respectively 
most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed or will be completed in new award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand 
corporate 
corporate administrative and general expenses totaled million for the year ended december  this compares with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the improvement in compared with is primarily due to the absence of charges relating to the reevaluation of the company s enterprise resource management erm system  recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in the beacon group energy investment fund  lp that were recognized in partially offsetting these charges in was recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment 
during significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the company s reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its erm system formerly known as knowledge work 
as part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original erm implementation plan and recognized a charge of million in for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense 
this charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan 
stock based compensation expense in was million lower compared with primarily as a result of a significant increase in the trading price of the company s common stock during the first half of the impact of changes in the stock price in and did not have a significant impact on stock based compensation expense as exercises  retirements and conversions have reduced the number of stock price sensitive units outstanding 
during overhead cost reductions were realized as a result of the early retirement of two former senior executives at the end of and the elimination of the business services and other segment 
this segment included the company s shared services operations 
shared services are grouped in corporate administrative and general expense for all periods presented 
net interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared with net interest expense of for the year ended december  the reduction in net interest income in is the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings 
table of contents compared with the increase in net interest income in compared with is primarily due to the elimination of short term borrowings 
the effective tax rates on the company s continuing operations were percent  percent and percent  for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the tax rate in compared with is primarily due to the utilization of certain capital loss carryforwards coupled with reduced foreign losses without tax benefit 
in addition  during the company had favorable tax return adjustments and settlements which were partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance to adjust net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the tax rate in compared with was lower due to the tax benefits from tax settlements and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
matters in dispute resolution 
during  several matters on certain completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process 
the following discussion provides a background and current status of these matters murrin murrin disputes between fluor australia fluor and its client  anaconda nickel anaconda  over the murrin murrin nickel cobalt project located in western australia were partially resolved through arbitration during the third quarter of the first phase of the arbitration hearing was completed in may and a decision was rendered in september resulting in an award to anaconda of a million subsequently amended to a million 
us million 
and an award to fluor of a million 
us million 
for amounts owing from anaconda under the contract 
the company has recovered the first phase award plus substantially all defense costs incurred from available insurance 
on july   the supreme court of victoria  australia granted anaconda s appeal of an issue that had been decided in favor of fluor by the arbitration panel in the first phase 
this decision sends the arbitration panel s denial of anaconda s claim for the cost of a fifth autoclave train back to the panel for further reconsideration 
fluor has appealed the supreme court s decision to the state of victoria court of appeal 
the second phase of the arbitration was heard in september a decision is expected in the third quarter of the company anticipates that any liability arising from proceedings under either the first or the second phase of arbitration  regardless of the outcome of the appeal  will be covered by available insurance 
fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
v 
general electric company  et al usdc  southern district court  new york in october  fluor daniel international and fluor arabia ltd 
filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against general electric company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as saudi american general electric  a saudi arabian corporation 
the complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement  engineering and construction of the rabigh combined cycle power plant in saudi arabia 
subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter the company initiated arbitration proceedings in new york under the american arbitration association international rules 
the evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded and a decision is expected in the second quarter of dearborn industrial project duke fluor daniel d fd the dearborn industrial project the project started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in dearborn  michigan 
the initial turnkey agreement  dated november   consisted of three phases 
commencing shortly after notice to proceed  the owner operator  dearborn industrial generation dig  issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project 
the project has been severely delayed with completion of phase ii 
dig has unilaterally taken over completion and operation of phase ii and is commissioning that portion of the plant 
shortly thereafter  dig drew upon a million letter of credit which d fd expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute 
d fd 
table of contents retains lien rights in fee against the project 
in october  suit was commenced in michigan state court to foreclose on the lien interest 
in december  dig filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to d fd claiming  among other things  that d fd is liable to dig for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the dearborn plant 
the court has ordered the matter to arbitration 
the lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of d fd s claims against dig and dig s claims against d fd 
an arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration will likely proceed in early butinge nafta oil terminal on march   butinge nafta nafta commenced arbitration proceedings against fluor daniel intercontinental fdi concerning a bulk oil storage terminal the facility located in lithuania alleging  among other issues  that fdi represented costs in excess of actual estimates 
fdi engineered  procured and managed the construction of the facility on a lump sum basis 
on june   fluor filed a separate arbitration against nafta to recover delay disruption damages caused by nafta  as well as compensation for out of scope services 
the first hearing on the merits of the case was conducted in late may with an additional hearing in june final legal submissions and arguments were completed in september in june  fdi was issued a favorable award on its claims and nafta s major claims against fdi were dismissed with prejudice resulting in a net award to fluor of million 
the resolution of this matter did not have a material effect on results of operations

strategic reorganization costs 
in march  the company reorganized its engineering and construction operations and recorded a special provision to cover direct and other reorganization related costs primarily for personnel  facilities and asset impairment adjustments 
the plan was successfully implemented and carried out 
as of december   the remaining unexpended reserve is million and relates to non us personnel costs that will be paid as follows million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
discontinued operations 
in september  the board of directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the company s construction equipment and non epc components of its temporary staffing businesses 
an active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and is complete as of the end of operating results for these non core businesses have been reclassified and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 
during the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of million 
in  the sale of one dealership subsidiary resulted in cash proceeds of million 
other dealership asset disposals during produced proceeds of million 
in december  the company sold one dealership entity for cash equal to its carrying value generating proceeds of million 
during the second quarter of  the australian operations of the temporary staffing operations of trs were sold  resulting in cash proceeds of million 
the temporary staffing industry experienced severe competition in due to depressed economic conditions  which resulted in significant erosion in the fair value of the trs businesses that were sold 
as a result  the company recognized adjustments to the carrying value of trs s us and us based disposal groups 
the sales of the us and us operations were completed in the fourth quarter of resulting in proceeds of million 
disposal of ameco operations in argentina and peru were finalized in resulting in proceeds of million primarily from collection of accounts receivable and sales of inventory and equipment 
interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the non core businesses because disposal of these operations did not include any debt to be assumed by the buyers 

table of contents revenue and the results of operations  including loss on disposal  for all discontinued operations are as follows year ended december in thousands revenue dealership operations other equipment operations temporary staffing operations total revenue earnings loss from discontinued operations dealership operations other equipment operations temporary staffing operations earnings from discontinued operations before tax provision for taxes earnings loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal before tax provision for taxes tax benefit loss on disposal the loss on disposal in all periods presented above is for impairment provisions to adjust the carrying value of the assets held for sale of the various individual non core businesses to fair value 
impairment provisions for the equipment operations included adjustments to the carrying value of equipment inventories  fixed assets and goodwill 
impairment provisions for the temporary staffing operations primarily included adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill 
financial position and liquidity cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to the significant use of cash to fund project operations 
this compares to substantial cash provided by operating activities in and significant cash was used in and to fund projects in the power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of million and million  respectively 
these advances represent the company s proportional share of excess cash from duke fluor daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in and prior years upon award of projects 
the joint venture partners manage excess cash of duke fluor daniel through these proportional advances 
client advances on duke fluor daniel projects is a normal condition of contracts in the power industry where most of the projects are negotiated on a fixed price basis 
as these projects progress  the expenditures for labor and materials is partially funded from these advance payments 
a substantial number of projects were completed in and and the advances used to fund these completed projects were not replaced with new advances due to the significant reduction in new awards in the power segment 
the work off of projects in progress and the significant reduction in new power industry awards experienced in and is expected to continue in the near term future and will further reduce total advances available to the company 
the company also used significant cash in to fund on going work and the change orders that are in the dispute resolution process relating to the hamaca project in venezuela 
the company is incurring substantial costs relating to the change orders for which it is not currently being paid pending resolution through arbitration 
as of december   the company has million in deferred costs on this project  of which million was funded during on going work on hamaca not associated with change orders used approximately million of cash from advances received in prior years 
excluding the impact of the repayment of advances relating to power projects and the funding for the hamaca project  cash
