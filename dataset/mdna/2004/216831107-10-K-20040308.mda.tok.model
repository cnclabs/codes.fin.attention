item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business of the company the company has two reportable segments cooper tire and cooper standard automotive 
the company s reportable segments are each managed separately because they offer different products requiring different marketing and distribution strategies 
cooper tire the tire segment produces passenger  light truck and motorcycle tires  and inner tubes  which are sold nationally and internationally in the replacement tire market to independent tire dealers  wholesale distributors  regional and national retail tire chains  and large retail chains that sell tires as well as other automotive products  and supplies retread equipment and materials to the commercial truck tire industry 
cooper standard automotive the automotive segment produces body sealing systems  active and passive vibration control systems  and fluid handling systems  primarily for the global automotive original equipment manufacturing and replacement markets 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presents information related to the consolidated results of operations of the company  including the impact of restructuring costs on the company s results  a discussion of past results and future outlook of each of the company s segments  and information concerning both the liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies of the company 
an important qualification regarding the forward looking statements made in this discussion is then presented

these amounts were reduced by million in price adjustments granted to certain oem customers 
operating profit in was million less than the operating profit reported in the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on operating profit approximated million 
in the tire segment higher raw material costs and operating inefficiencies experienced during the first half of the year contributed to the lower operating profit in operating profit in the automotive segment declined as the positive impacts of net new business  favorable foreign currency translation and lean savings were more than offset by price concessions  higher raw material costs and inefficiencies resulting from the launch of new business during the year 
restructuring expense was million cents per share in compared to million cents per share in selling  general  and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in the million increase over spending is due to increased advertising expense and costs associated with employee health care and pension benefits partially offset by decreases in the cost of employee incentive programs that provide for compensation based on profitability 
during the tire segment conducted a review of its reserves for tire product warranties 
this review resulted in a million increase to the segment s regular warranty reserve and a million reduction of the estimated enhanced product warranty reserve established in connection with the settlement of class action litigation 
the company is a defendant in various products liability claims in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits  and the 
table of contents establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the policy year are million higher than under the previous program while coverage increased by million 
in the future  products liability costs could have a materially greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company than in the past 
the company experienced significant increases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials and natural gas  the principal energy source used in its manufacturing processes  during compared with the levels experienced during the principal raw materials for the tire segment include synthetic rubber  carbon black  natural rubber  chemicals and reinforcement components 
the principal raw materials for the automotive segment include fabricated metal based components  synthetic rubber  carbon black and natural rubber 
the increase in the cost of natural rubber was the most significant driver of higher raw material costs  increasing approximately percent from the average cost of natural gas during has increased approximately percent from the average cost during the company manages the procurement of its raw materials and natural gas to guarantee supply and to obtain the most favorable pricing 
for natural rubber and natural gas  procurement is managed using long term agreements  buying forward of production requirements and buying in the spot market 
for metal based components  procurement is managed through long term supply contracts 
for other principal materials  procurement arrangements include multi year supply agreements that may contain formula based pricing based on commodity indices 
these arrangements only cover quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands 
interest expense decreased million in reflecting the repayment of debt and lower interest rates 
other income was relatively unchanged from the company s effective income tax rate was percent in  lower than the rate of percent 
the rate decrease from is due to the impact of global tax planning  additional tax credits and the mix of earnings across foreign and domestic jurisdictions 
at december   the company has future tax benefits of million related to various foreign and state net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards for which valuation reserves of million have been recorded 
the company recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards because the company is uncertain regarding its ability to utilize them 
the remaining million of future tax benefits primarily results from net operating loss carryforwards incurred in the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and france and various united states tax credit carryforwards 
some of these can be utilized indefinitely while others expire from to the amounts expiring in the next five years  for which no valuation allowance has been recorded  approximate million 
it is more likely than not the carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been established will be realized based upon forecasted future earnings  which are anticipated to result in future taxable income  and the implementation of certain tax strategies 
the effects of inflation in areas other than raw materials and natural gas did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in versus net sales in were million higher than the sales recorded in of this increase  approximately million is the result of favorable foreign currency translation 
the tire segment improvement was due to higher sales volumes to the regional tire retail business along with increased sales of its proprietary brand name tires 
the automotive segment sales increased due to higher light vehicle production and the impact of net new business that was partially offset by price concessions 
operating profit in was million higher than the operating profit reported in operating profit in benefited from the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the accounting pronouncement that requires the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested annually for impairment 
the amortization of goodwill in was million 
results in also improved due to higher sales in both the tire and automotive segments and the benefits of the restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives in the automotive segment 
reductions from of million in tire products liability costs also benefited operating profit in further  operating profit in was adversely affected by a charge for a tire products class action settlement and related defense costs of million million after income taxes  or cents per share 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in this spending increase is largely attributable to the cost of employee incentive programs that provide for compensation based on profitability 
interest expense in decreased million from the million reported in this decrease reflects the impacts of approximately million related to the repayment of debt and million related to interest rate swaps 
other income decreased by million during from million in gains resulting from the sale of two tire warehouses and an aircraft in were responsible for million of income  while in the sale of an aircraft contributed million of 
table of contents income 
the decrease in is also partially attributable to premium costs of million incurred in connection with the repurchase of portions of the company s public notes during the effective tax rate was percent in  a decrease from the percent rate in this decrease was due primarily to the elimination of the amortization of non deductible goodwill in accordance with sfas no  which became effective january   and global tax planning  which was offset by increases in valuation reserves 
the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in restructuring following is a summary of restructuring initiatives and other restructuring expenses on the results of operations for the years  and dollar amounts in millions year initiatives year initiatives other expenses year initiatives other expenses year initiatives other expenses restructuring expenses year in  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million related to decisions to close or consolidate manufacturing plants and administrative facilities  downsize the workforce at those and other locations  and relocate assets and ongoing business from locations for which closure decisions had been made prior to the charge was taken in part to take advantage of the synergies available following completion of the standard products and siebe acquisitions in and  respectively  and  in part to a more generalized need to enhance future profitability through better utilization of existing capacity and the creation of greater operational efficiencies 
a total of facilities were closed or downsized and employees were terminated in conjunction with these restructuring initiatives 
in and  reversals of the charge for these initiatives were recorded  due primarily to lower than anticipated headcount reductions in the european facilities affected by consolidation  and by severance costs that were lower than anticipated for those employees who were terminated 
the restructuring initiatives associated with this charge were completed in year in  the company recognized restructuring charges of million related to the automotive segment for headcount reductions at four manufacturing and administrative facilities and asset impairment charges related to long lived assets 
these charges were taken as part of the automotive segment s decision to reorganize and rationalize certain of its north american operations to reduce overall overhead costs 
a total of employees were terminated as a result of these restructuring efforts 
the company completed these reductions during additional restructuring expenses were recorded in associated with the relocation of assets from closed manufacturing facilities in the automotive segment and to additional employee separation costs 
these amounts were offset by the reversal of a portion of the charge taken in year in  the company recorded additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of the company s fluid systems manufacturing operations in sao paulo  brazil to the company s manufacturing plant in varginha  brazil  the consolidation of the company s rubber mixing operations in europe to its mixing facility in france  and a small consolidation of facilities in the united kingdom 
this initiative resulted in headcount reductions of approximately employees associated with these consolidations  and was taken because of the need to reduce ongoing costs in the company s international operations  where profitability has lagged due in part to overhead costs resulting from excess production capacity 
the company completed these initiatives in additional restructuring expenses were recorded in related to asset write downs at north american facilities in excess of the amounts established in the restructuring reserves  additional severance costs  and costs of transferring assets and ongoing production from closed facilities in europe and north america 
these restructuring amounts were offset by the reversal of a portion of the charges taken in and the reversal of a portion of the charge was due to the fact that fewer employees were terminated than had originally been anticipated 

table of contents year in  the company recorded restructuring expenses related to three initiatives  one in the tire segment and two in the automotive segment 
the tire segment announced a management reorganization resulting in the elimination of positions 
all employees impacted by this reorganization have left the company and are being paid their severance package in accordance with the terms of their separation 
the automotive segment announced the closure of the plastics manufacturing facility in cleveland 
this closure will affect approximately hourly and salaried employees and the segment has targeted the second quarter of for completion of this initiative 
the automotive segment also announced the closure of two manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom 
these closures will affect approximately hourly and salaried employees and the second quarter of is the target date for the completion of these initiatives 
other restructuring expenses recorded in relate to severance costs incurred in other locations  costs incurred in the transfer of product lines from one location to another  the consolidation of offices in the united kingdom and asset write downs at two sold facilities 
additional information related to these restructuring initiatives appears in the restructuring note to the consolidated financial statements 
tire segment dollar amounts in millions change change sales operating profit operating profit margin united states unit sales changes passenger tires company rma members light truck tires company rma members total light vehicle tires company rma members total segment unit sales changes overview sales of passenger car and light truck tire replacement units in the united states market by members of the rubber manufacturers association rma  a group comprised of the largest eleven tire companies in the world including the segment  and which accounted for over percent of the total united states tire market in both and  increased less than one percent in from levels in in  rma member replacement unit sales decreased by percent from sales levels 
sales of replacement tire units in the united states by non rma members  which consist primarily of smaller manufacturers located outside the united states  increased by approximately percent during following a percent increase during consumer demand was soft in early due primarily to a weakened united states economy and the end of the firestone tire recall 
this softening continued generally throughout the year  although a subsequent recall by ford motor company of certain firestone tires in mid provided a boost to the market during that period 
the company believes that the terrorist incidents of september  contributed to a significant weakening of the economy during the latter part of with the exception of a rebound in the first quarter of  the market remained weak during and continued to be weak through the first five months of in june  the replacement tire market began to show signs of rebounding after decreasing more than three percent in the first six months 
the market improvement continued during the last six months of and the year ended showing a slight increase over levels 
versus 
table of contents sales of the tire segment increased million in from levels in of this increase  approximately million was attributable to favorable foreign currency translation 
tire unit sales for were up two percent from better economic conditions and new product offerings of high performance  sport utility vehicle and light truck tires contributed to the increased unit tire sales 
the segment recorded increased sales of its proprietary  brand name tires and increased sales in the regional retail business 
sales from the segment s acquisition of mickey thompson performance tires wheels  completed in march  increased sales for the year by approximately million 
in the united states  the segment s unit sales of passenger and light truck tires were unchanged from levels 
during the last six months of  the segment s passenger tire sales increased more than seven percent compared to an increase of slightly more than five percent for rma members 
passenger tires account for over percent of the combined passenger and light and medium truck replacement tire market 
the segment s increased sales of its high performance and sport utility vehicle tires were factors contributing to this performance 
the segments sales of its light truck tires increased more than nine percent over the last six months compared to the comparable period in the rma increase in this category was slightly more than two percent 
new light truck products introduced earlier in the year helped the segment outperform the rma increase in that product category during sales of the segment s international operations increased million  or percent  in from approximately million of the increase in was attributable to the foreign exchange impact of a weakened united states dollar in relation to the british pound 
the remaining sales growth resulted primarily from strong winter and sport utility vehicle tire sales in europe  the addition of new accounts in and increased volumes in established distribution channels 
segment operating profit in decreased almost million from operating margins in were three percentage points below levels 
higher raw material costs of approximately million  increases in products liability costs of million  and the inefficiencies resulting from not being able to operate the plants at full capacity during the first six months of  partially offset by improvements in product and customer mix  resulted in the lower operating profit 
in the first quarter of  the company announced a reorganization of its tire segment management structure that resulted in the elimination of approximately salaried positions 
restructuring charges of million for this initiative were recorded in versus sales for increased million from the levels 
tire unit sales for were up percent from the segment significantly increased its sales volumes to the growing regional tire retail business and also reported higher sales of its proprietary  brand name tires 
despite product pricing that was higher in than in  the segment s overall dollar sales increase was slightly lower than its unit sales improvement  due principally to the sale of a large number of opening price point tires to a large retail customer 
the segment s unit sales of passenger tires increased percent in  versus a sales decrease of percent by rma members 
the segment was able to increase market penetration in this product line in spite of a continued increase in imported  low priced passenger tires 
the segment s unit sales of light truck replacement tires increased in by percent compared to an increase by rma members of percent 
the replacement market for light truck tires experienced a significant increase in the imports in operating profit in increased million from levels 
the segment s performance in reflects the adverse impact of the class action settlement and related defense costs of million  or percentage points of operating margin 
operating performance in north america in was adversely impacted by several factors a less favorable product and customer mix  which impacted operating profit by million  inefficiencies resulting from operating the segment s manufacturing facilities at less than full capacity as it implemented inventory reductions  which negatively affected operating profit by about million  and higher employee incentive based compensation and benefit costs of approximately million 
the less favorable product and customer mix occurred because a greater percentage of the segment s sales resulted from shipments of opening price point tires to lower margin customers 
offsetting these negative factors were an increase in sales  which favorably impacted operating profit by almost million  and lower raw material costs of million 
operating profit during was helped by a more favorable product mix  price increases implemented in north america during the first and third quarters  and moderation during the year in the cost of energy and certain raw materials derived from petroleum 
by the end of the year  many raw materials used by the segment were priced lower than in recent years 
these improvements were not sufficient  however  to offset the impacts of lower sales  products liability provisions which impacted the segment by million in and production curtailments that took place in response to the weak market conditions experienced during the year 
the cost of these production curtailments totaled million in outlook 
table of contents the company is optimistic the significant sales improvement that was experienced by the tire segment during the second half of the year will continue into an increase in overall consumer confidence  the continuing economic recovery  and evidence of a return to a more typical consumer demand for replacement tires following an extended period of sluggishness in the replacement tire industry provide reason for optimism about sales 
in part  the market s weakness from through the first half of has been due to the impact of the recalls of firestone tires that took place in and these programs artificially accelerated the replacement at that time of tires which would otherwise not have been replaced until as late as this year 
in addition  significant customer commitments  which began coming online in the fourth quarter of and are expected to reach full ramp up in  will also contribute to continued sales growth 
continued market share gains by the segment s house brands and increased volumes for its high performance products are expected to contribute to sales 
the company believes the tire segment s operating profit levels will continue to improve not only due to higher sales volumes and the implementation of announced price increases  but also due to the favorable impact of improved product and customer mix 
the segment s aggressive growth plans for specific house brand and key private brand customers  growth in its high performance product lines  and increasing demand for its sport utility vehicle and light truck tire lines are expected to yield higher margins and contribute favorably to operating profit 
this increased volume should enable the plants to operate at full capacity  allowing the segment to improve operating efficiencies 
additionally the segment continues to implement lean manufacturing and other cost reduction initiatives  including improved manufacturing efficiencies  to offset increased raw material costs 
raw material prices remain difficult to predict accurately 
the price levels of crude oil and natural rubber are likely to continue at very high levels in the near term and the price levels of steel based tire reinforcement materials are increasing due to supply allocations by manufacturers 
the company believes raw material costs will be more than ten percent higher on average in the first quarter of than in the first quarter of in early november  the company announced a price increase to be effective february the segment continues to pursue opportunities for expansion in asia through joint ventures and other forms of alliance  as well as through existing contract manufacturing arrangements 
the segment currently has a manufacturing supply agreement with an asian manufacturer to provide opening price point passenger tires from china for distribution in the european market 
in addition  the segment recently announced plans to transfer its radial medium truck tire production to china through contract manufacturing arrangements which will make domestic production capacity available for the production of larger light truck tires and other higher margin products 
in total  the segment sourced approximately  tires from china in and expects to source million tires in through various asian manufacturing initiatives 
these initiatives are important to the segment s ability to profitably provide tire products to its customers in north america and around the world 
the segment has announced plans for increased capital equipment investments in its united states tire manufacturing facilities 
these investments will provide additional production capacity of more than million tires to meet the steadily increasing demand for the segment s tires 
in the wake of the firestone recall announced in  the tire industry and the company have experienced a significantly higher level of products liability litigation 
it is possible the cost of this litigation and the number of claims brought against the company will remain at the current levels during effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits  and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the policy year are million higher than under the previous program while coverage increased by million 
in the future  products liability costs could have a materially greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company than in the past 
the transportation recall enhancement accountability and documentation act tread act which became law on november  will directly impact the tire industry 
the tread act and any rules promulgated under the tread act are applicable to all tire manufacturers and importers of tires who sell tires in the united states  regardless of where such tires are manufactured 
pursuant to the statute  the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa  the federal agency that oversees certain aspects of the tire industry  has proposed rules relating to test standards  tire labeling  tire pressure monitoring  early warning reporting  tire recalls and record retention 
rules for certain of these issues have been finalized  however  petitions for reconsideration of certain of the finalized rules have been filed by the rma on behalf of its member tire manufacturers with nhtsa and the outcome of those petitions cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the segment did not incur significant costs associated with implementing these rules in and does not anticipate incurring significant costs in automotive segment

light vehicle production in north america decreased in when compared to levels but exceeded the production levels attained in production in europe increased slightly over the level and approached the level achieved in the business environment for the automotive industry continues to be challenging at the present time 
pricing pressure on the us based oems  as evidenced by the zero percent financing and record high rebates offered since late  increased pension and other retirement related costs  and the impact of global overcapacity have reduced the overall profitability of the industry  and have resulted in continued pressure on suppliers for price concessions

operating profit for the segment in improved million from and operating margins increased by percentage points 
operating profit in was favorably impacted by the absence of amortization of goodwill  which amounted to million in  the increase in light vehicle production from  which was responsible for approximately million of the improvement  the impact of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in and and  to a lesser extent  increased volume resulting from the launch of new business 
in addition  the segment was able to operate its facilities more efficiently in as a result of more stable oem production levels than was the case in the segment s results reflect its successful efforts to overcome the adverse impacts of price concessions granted to the segment s customers and increases in the costs of employee pensions and medical benefits 
the segment s operating profit in reflected depressed north american light vehicle production levels and disruption due to restructuring activities in the segment s manufacturing facilities  including inefficiencies resulting from the redeployment of the business of the closed rocky mount  north carolina sealing production plant to two other facilities 
other factors were the inefficiencies created by erratic scheduling resulting from the short lead times given by the oems in advance of the frequent production curtailments that occurred during the year and price concessions granted in the segment s business outside of north america was profitable in  whereas losses were recorded in the improvement was due to more efficient operations in both the sealing and fluid systems units in europe  as efforts to reduce the cost structure of the segment s european operations through the restructuring initiatives implemented over the past two years favorably impacted results 
these improvements more than offset the effects of weak economic conditions affecting the segment s brazilian operations 
the segment s business outside of north america was not profitable in  due to costs associated with significant product launches in both the sealing and fluid systems units in the united kingdom  the inefficiencies associated with the substantial restructuring that the segment has undertaken in europe  and the effects of a weakened economy in brazil  due largely to an energy crisis 
outlook sales for the automotive segment are expected to increase in from the levels achieved in  due to larger volumes  the ramp up of new business launched in and more favorable foreign currency translation 
the performance of the segment in may differ substantially from the segment s present expectations if light vehicle production is significantly higher or lower than is presently forecasted 
the segment is currently projecting that light vehicle production in in north america  where nearly percent of the segment s sales are made  will be million vehicles  an increase from the million units produced in european production levels in are expected to approximate the levels of light vehicle production in south america is expected to increase to million vehicles in from million vehicles produced in the competitive conditions in the global automotive industry continue to result in pressure on the segment to reduce the pricing for its products 
the continued ability of the segment to maintain or improve its financial returns is dependent upon increasing its sales and reducing its costs to a level sufficient to offset the impact of price concessions 
certain divisions of the segment are being affected by competition from imports from lower cost production facilities  principally in korea and china 
the segment plans to meet this challenge with a combination of north american cost reductions and its own asian sourcing 
certain component materials are currently being sourced from asian manufacturers and the segment expects to increase its sourcing volumes significantly during the segment is also working to achieve production and sales agreements in china to

new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims in which individuals involved in vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires manufactured by the company 
the company s current policy is to conduct a quarterly evaluation of each individual products liability claim based on the specific facts and circumstances of each claim  historical trends and an assessment of the litigation environment 
a judgment is then made  taking into account the views of counsel  past experience and other relevant factors  to determine the company s requirement to establish or revise an accrual for the aggregate liability 
the company s exposure for each claim occurring prior to april  is limited by the coverage provided by its excess liability insurance program 
the program for that period includes a relatively low per claim retention and a policy year aggregate retention limit on claims arising from occurrences which took place during a particular policy year 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes an increased per claim retention limit  increased policy limits  and the establishment of a captive insurance company 
premium costs for insurance coverage in excess of the self insured amounts for the policy year are million higher than under the previous program while coverage increased by million 
in the future  products liability costs could have a materially greater impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company than in the past 
legal costs are expensed as incurred and products liability insurance premiums are amortized over coverage periods 
during the tire segment recorded million for insurance recoveries of legal costs previously expensed in prior years based on events occurring during which entitled the company to reimbursement under its insurance contracts 
the discussion of products liability costs in the company s consolidated financial statements includes the legal costs incurred in defending claims brought against the company  including the insurance recoveries  products liability insurance premium costs  and accruals recorded pursuant to the foregoing policy 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of 
table of contents deferred tax assets  the company establishes a valuation allowance to record its deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future projections for taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded on purchased net operating loss carryforwards of million and  to the extent such benefits are realized  the benefits will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
at december   the company has future tax benefits of million  including the acquired net operating loss carryforwards  related to various foreign and state net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards for which valuation reserves of million have been recorded 
the company recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because the company is uncertain regarding its ability to utilize them 
the remaining million of future tax benefits primarily results from net operating loss carryforwards incurred by the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and france and various united states tax credit carryforwards 
some of these can be utilized indefinitely while others expire from through the amounts expiring in the next five years  for which no valuation allowance has been recorded  approximate million 
it is more likely than not the carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been established will be realized based upon forecasted future earnings  which are anticipated to result in future taxable income  and the implementation of certain tax strategies 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
during  impairments of million were recorded as part of the company s restructuring expenses 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company assessed its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and no impairment was indicated 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
based on current facts  the company believes there is no impairment 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations  primarily for plans in the united states 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets  and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the pension and other postretirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company considers the most recent available interest rates on moody s aa corporate bonds with maturities of at least ten years late in the fourth quarter and then factors into the rate its expectations for change by year end 
based upon this analysis  the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its united states pension and postretirement benefit liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the effect of this one half percent reduction in the discount rate assumption will be increases of approximately million in pension expense and approximately million in other postretirement benefits expense during the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  because the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is based on profitability 
the company reduced the rate of future compensation increases used to measure its united states pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december   primarily due to its outlook for the economy and the industries in which it competes 
the effect of this one half percent decrease in the assumption for compensation increases in will be a decrease of approximately million in pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension 
table of contents expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
the company s investment policy for united states plans assets is to maintain an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
this computed rate of return is reviewed by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
in  the actual return on united states pension plans assets approximated percent  exceeding the nine percent expected rate of return on plan assets used to derive pension expense 
the higher actual return on plan assets reflects the recovery of the equity markets experienced in from the depressed levels which have existed since the end of based on recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company maintained its estimate for the expected long term return on its united states plan assets at nine percent  the same assumption used to derive expense 
the company has accumulated net deferred gains and losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts will be amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  over periods ranging from years to years 
in  amortization of these net deferred gains and losses was million 
the company instituted per participant caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to future retirees at the time it adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to mitigate the impact of medical cost inflation on the company s retiree medical obligation 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the medical care cost trend rate has a significant impact on the liabilities recorded by the company 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase retiree medical obligations by million and increase retiree medical benefits expense by 
million 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was enacted in december  the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
specific implementation guidance for the accounting for this legislation is pending 
in accordance with the deferral provided by fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  any measures of the apbo or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act on the plan 
the company will measure postretirement benefit costs in accordance with the legislation when specific guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued 
the company implemented increased cost sharing and plan design changes effective in in the retiree medical coverage provided to current domestic salaried  non bargained hourly and certain bargained retirees 
domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees hired on or after january  are not eligible for these benefits 
during the company implemented changes to the health benefits it provides to its domestic salaried and non bargained hourly employees 
subject to specific provisions contained in certain of its labor agreements  the company has reserved the right to modify or terminate such benefits at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has provided a guarantee of a portion of the bank loans made to its joint venture with nishikawa rubber company 
this debt guarantee is required of the partners by the joint venture agreement and serves to support the credit worthiness of the joint venture  nishikawa standard company nisco 
on july   the joint venture entered into an additional bank loan with the joint venture partners each guaranteeing an equal portion of the amount borrowed 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  guarantees meeting the characteristics described in the interpretation are required to be recorded at fair value 
as of december  the company has recorded a  liability related to the guarantee of this debt with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture 
the company s maximum exposure under the two guarantee arrangements at december  was million 
as of december  the company had no other off balance sheet arrangements
