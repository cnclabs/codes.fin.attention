overview we design  develop  manufacture and market high performance digital media that we market as digital film as well as other flash based storage products for consumer markets that utilize media for the capture and retrieval of digital content for the digital photography  consumer electronics  industrial and communications markets 
to address the growing market for compact digital data and media storage solutions  we also market our jumpdrive products  which are high speed  portable usb flash drives for consumer applications that serve a variety of uses  including floppy disk replacement 
in addition  we market a variety of connectivity products that link our media products to pcs and other electronic host devices 
we also license our proprietary controller technology and sell controllers to other manufacturers of flash storage media 
our product revenues increased by over in both and and we expect continued strong demand for our products in this rate of growth poses a number of challenges for us 
we are focused on meeting this demand by trying to insure that our supply of flash memory and flash card components is sufficient to meet our demand  that our costs for such memory and components allow us to sell our products at competitive prices  that our supply chain can support our rates of growth and that we have sufficient engineering resources to design the products demanded by our customers 
we are also focused on expanding our distribution and trying to insure that our products are available at outlets where consumers look to purchase these products  expanding our distribution internationally  and expanding our sales to markets other than retail  particularly to oem customers 
in addition to meeting consumer demand with cost competitive products  we face other challenges as well 
flash card formats continue to change and to miniaturize 
we are focused on trying to insure that we have the rights to manufacture and sell all flash card formats  that we have the engineering resources to design controllers for new formats and that we have partners with manufacturing capabilities that allow us to produce the newest and most advanced flash card formats and high capacity cards 
we believe that a number of companies are selling flash products that infringe our intellectual property  and we are focused on protecting our intellectual property through either litigation and or negotiations 
we believe that meeting these and other challenges will be necessary to remain competitive in our market 
revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from the sale of digital media and connectivity products to end users through mass market  photo and oem channels 
since the beginning of  we significantly increased our presence in the mass market channel by increasing the number of retail storefronts in which our customers sell our products 
our products were sold in more than  retail stores worldwide at the end of  which represents an increase of approximately  storefronts from the end of and an increase of approximately  storefronts from the end of as is common practice in the mass market channel  we offer our customers various programs and incentive offerings  including price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
digital media sales comprised of our gross revenues for 
table of contents we also generate revenues from the sales of our controllers to flash storage manufacturers and from license and royalty revenues under license agreements  primarily with samsung 
in april  we finalized a supply agreement and a license agreement with samsung electronics co  ltd 
under the supply agreement  we purchase substantially all of our flash memory from samsung  which is priced based upon an agreed methodology 
samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of flash memory production capacity to us 
in addition  samsung also has the right to purchase our flash memory controllers 
under the agreement  samsung provides us with intellectual property indemnification for the products we purchase from samsung  as well as industry standard warranties 
the supply agreement runs through march  unless we and samsung mutually agree to extend the agreement 
the license payments from samsung are fixed through march  we are paid only variable based royalties thereafter 
we expect royalties from samsung after march  to be minimal 
variable based royalties depend on factors such as which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market share and our aggregate purchases from samsung 
we are also actively working to license our technology to other companies that we believe infringe our patents 
a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
our top customers accounted for of our gross revenues in  in and in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
product sales in north america have accounted for the majority of our total net product revenues 
net product revenues in north america represented approximately  and of our total net product revenues in  and the markets we serve with our digital film  jumpdrive and mp products have been expanding rapidly 
this has increased the pressure on our ability to ensure an adequate supply of components and the scalability of our operations to meet surges in product demand such as we experienced in the fiscal fourth quarter of when product revenues grew sequentially over the third quarter of on a continuing basis  we must forecast our customer s product mix and volume accurately to ensure that we can meet their demands 
if we are unable to forecast our customer s product mix and volume accurately it may affect our ability to grow our revenues as projected and could result in product obsolescence or inventory write downs  which would impair our profits 
cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues consists primarily of materials costs  with flash memory accounting for a majority of the costs for both the products we manufacture and the products we purchase 
we maintain relationships with key suppliers and  in particular  we have supply agreements with both samsung and umc 
samsung  who is our primary supplier of flash memory  has guaranteed that we will have access to a portion of its available production capacity at preferential pricing to us 
our industry has historically experienced annual price reductions of flash memory in the range of to percent 
the cost of flash memory declined significantly in and moderately in and in the first half of in the second half of  prices of flash memory increased as industry wide demand for flash memory outpaced the supply of flash memory  which resulted in a general industry wide shortage 
we expect this trend to continue during the first half of however  for fiscal overall  we expect price reductions of flash memory in the historical range of to  with the majority of the price reductions occurring in the second half of the year 
a number of companies  including  hynix  infineon and micron  have announced plans to enter the flash market in the second half of in addition  other companies  including renesas  samsung and toshiba  have announced that they plan to expand their production of flash memory during if these companies successfully introduce and or expand output of flash devices  it could create an over supply situation in the second half of  driving costs down in excess of historical averages 
some publications have reported that samsung plans to reduce its flash memory prices by this year to stimulate demand and protect its market share against new entrants 
cost of product revenues also includes expenses related to materials procurement  inventory management  other overhead expenses and adjustments 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel  fees for outside consultants  patent development and registration costs 
table of contents and prototype development and materials costs 
the technology in our industry is evolving as flash cards  usb flash drives and mp players become smaller in size  perform at faster speeds  increase storage capacity and require development of new hardware and software applications to meet the demands of the target markets we serve 
in addition  as new suppliers of flash memory enter the market  we will continue to evaluate their flash memory and make modifications to our controller technology as necessary to be able to utilize new flash memory technology in our products 
as a result of these and other developments  we believe that continued investment in research and development is important to enable us to attain our strategic objectives and we therefore expect research and development expenses to increase during sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses include salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  advertising  customer service  technical support  distribution and travel and trade show expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to vary during primarily in conjunction with changes in sales volumes throughout the year and we also expect to increase discretionary sales and marketing expenses for advertising and brand development 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for executive  administrative and operational personnel  fees for professional services and other corporate expenses 
during  we increased our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights and license our technology to those companies that we believe infringe our intellectual property 
our legal expenses have significantly increased as a result of these efforts and we expect that our legal expenses will continue at this increased level during in addition to our current litigation  a number of companies have brought products to market  which we believe may infringe our intellectual property 
if one of our legal actions were to proceed to trial in  or if we become involved in additional litigation  our legal expenses could significantly increase beyond current levels 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation related to options granted to employees represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the deemed fair market value of the stock underlying options and the exercise prices of these options 
stock based compensation related to options granted to consultants is revalued as it vests using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options based on an accelerated vesting method 
at december   we had no remaining unearned stock based compensation to be amortized 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to price protection  customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including price protection  rebates and other customer programs  and valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  including sales returns and other allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and inventory write downs 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenues we derive our revenues primarily from sales of our digital media products  which include flash memory devices  controllers and connectivity products 
as discussed below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we sell products to distributors  retailers  oems and end users 
some of our customers have return rights 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for certain customers where we are able to reasonably estimate the level of product returns and sales incentives  at the time revenue is recorded  we record estimated reductions to product revenue based upon our customer sales incentive programs and the historical experience of product returns  and the impact of special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
in order to make such estimates  we analyze historical returns  current economic conditions  customer demand and other relevant specific customer information 
if  in the future  we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances for these customers  it could have a significant impact on our revenue recognition  potentially requiring us to defer the recognition of additional sales until our customers sell the products to their end customer 
in such an event our recognized revenue could be adversely impacted in the periods in which we implement a transition to such a basis 
for customers where we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances  revenues and the costs of revenues are deferred until either these customers have sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these customers to sell the product to their customers has elapsed 
over the past several years  revenue related to all new retail customers that have return rights or other revenue allowances have been accounted for on a deferred basis 
deferred customers have become a larger portion of our business  and we expect that trend to continue 
license and royalty revenues when we have a signed license agreement  the technology has been delivered  there are no remaining significant obligations under the contract  the fee is fixed or determinable and non refundable and collectibility is reasonably assured  we recognize license fees and fixed non refundable royalties ratably over the term of the license or fixed royalty arrangement during which the customer has rights to the technology 
when royalties are based on the volume of products sold that incorporate our technology  revenue is recognized when earned 
variable royalties based on volume have been insignificant to date 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities inventory write downs we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we anticipate  for example  if product sales or prices decline more substantially than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue 
these differences have resulted in a net deferred tax asset 
our judgment is required to assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realizable 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset 
in the event management determines that it has become more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made  which would increase income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents other valuation allowances and accrued liabilities we also maintain accruals and allowances for price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
we incurred sales related discounts of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at december  and  we had related accruals and allowances of million and million  respectively 
price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts are provided for at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if market conditions were to change adversely  we may take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in increased accruals and allowances for these programs 
historically  warranty expenses have not been material 
in the event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace a product or products on a large scale  such an event may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the allowance may be required 
results of operations in view of the rapidly changing nature of our market and our operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and other operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our historic revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of our future growth

for example  retail sales were very strong in both the fourth quarters of and due to seasonal consumer demand during the holidays 
we experienced a increase in digital media units sold in compared with due to increased demand in the retail and oem channels and a increase in average capacity per digital media unit sold 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in our average selling price per megabyte of digital media 
we expect that the number of units and average capacity of digital media sold will continue to increase in and that the average selling price per megabyte of digital media will continue to decline at historical averages of between and per year 
we anticipate that our product revenues will increase in  despite the anticipated declines in the average selling price per megabyte of digital media

in  we derived   and of our product revenues from sales to customers in the united states  europe  japan and the rest of the world  respectively 
during  gross revenues from two customers  wal mart and one of our distributors  wynit  each represented greater than of our gross revenues 
we estimate that more than half of wynit s sales of our products are made to one customer  compusa 
we generate license and royalty revenues primarily from our agreement with samsung under which we license the use of our intellectual property 
our license and royalty revenues for were essentially unchanged compared to license and royalty revenues under our agreement with samsung become variable and are expected to become minimal beginning april  we will continue to seek new licensing opportunities in however  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in licensing our intellectual property  our total license and royalty revenues will decline significantly in 
table of contents we sell our controllers as a stand alone product to flash card manufacturers and license this technology to oems 
controller revenues for increased million  or  to million compared to million during fiscal compared with fiscal increased sales of our flash memory products in the retail channel was the major factor for the significant growth in our product revenues in increased sales into the retail market introduced an element of seasonality to our business that we had not experienced previously

these factors were partially offset by a decline in the cost per megabyte of digital media sold in compared to fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in cost of product revenues was primarily the result of both a increase in the number of digital media units sold and a increase in the average capacity of digital media unit sold 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in the cost per megabyte of digital media sold in compared to the cost in  and the benefits of improved inventory control and turnover compared to gross margin fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage for product revenues was primarily the result of the decline in average cost per megabyte of digital media unit sold partially offset by the decline in the average selling price per megabyte of digital media sold 
our product gross margin also benefited from a reduction in the rate of price protection to million  or of gross revenues in compared to million  or of gross revenues  in however  our product gross margin was negatively affected by a shift in the mix of our products sold 
products we purchase became a larger part of our revenues during compared to  and we generally have higher gross margins on products we manufacture compared with products we purchase 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal the improvement in gross margin percentage for product revenues was primarily the result of the decline in the cost per megabyte of digital media sold  reductions in price protection charges from million  or of gross product revenue  in to million  or of gross product revenue  in  and improved inventory control and turnover 
implementation of eitf and eitf resulted in classification of certain revenue reductions that negatively impacted product margins in by approximately

this decrease was offset by increases in compensation related expenses due to increased headcount of approximately million 
sales and marketing the increase in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was due to increased sales  which resulted in increases of million in freight and fulfillment expenses  million in market development 
table of contents expenses  million in compensation expenses and million in advertising expenses 
the increase in compensation expenses was due to both increased headcount and increased variable selling expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily attributable to overall cost reductions during which resulted in a million reduction in advertising  tradeshow and market development expenses and a million reduction in employee compensation expenses as a result of the restructuring we implemented in the second quarter of the reduction in advertising and tradeshow expenses resulted primarily from cost control measures 
the decrease in market development expenses was a result of certain expenses being classified as revenue reductions in these decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses that vary directly with sales  such as a million increase in commissions and a million increase in freight and fulfillment expenses 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due an increase of million in legal expenses in connection with our pending litigation and a million increase in compensation expenses related to increased headcount 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to a million reduction in employee compensation related expenses due to the restructuring that we implemented in the second quarter of as well as greater cost control in goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  we recognized a charge of million  or of revenues for the year  for printroom

withholding taxes are recoverable only as a credit against federal income taxes 
due to the uncertainty of the recoverability  the withholding taxes were reflected as income tax expense in and at december   for federal and state income tax reporting purposes we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
million of the million is attributable to stock option and employee stock purchase plan deductions  when utilized  the benefit from the million will be recognized as an increase in additional paid in capital 
at december  we had federal research credits and state research credits of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxes

changes in working capital for the period included a million increase in inventory  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin and a million increase 
table of contents in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in our inventory was due primarily to the increased levels of inventory required to satisfy demand for our products and the increase in consigned inventory balances of million at december  compared to december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased shipments of our products during and partially offset by an improvement in our days sales outstanding 
the decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin was primarily due to amortization of deferred license revenue related to our samsung  sony and olympus license agreements 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to increased prepayments made for inventory purchases and the increased balance of value added tax prepayments due to increased shipments to our european and japanese subsidiaries 
these changes in working capital were offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable was due primarily to increased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in provisions for market development funds of million  price protection of million and rebates of million 
the increases in these provisions were primarily the result of increased gross product revenues during compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included non cash charges of million of amortization of stock based compensation  million of depreciation and amortization and million of allowance to record inventory at net realizable value 
changes in working capital for the period included a million increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers related to increased inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of  an increase of million in accrued liabilities consisting primarily of increases of million in accrued market development funds  million in accrued price protection and million in accrued rebates  all of which were associated with increased sales volumes in the fourth quarter of as compared to  million in legal fees and related to a general increase in our business activities 
additionally  deferred license revenue and product margins increased by million  which was primarily attributable to the receipt of the upfront samsung license payment in the favorable impact from these changes was offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  which was primarily due to increases in our total net revenues and deferred product revenues and an increase in our days sales outstanding due to the timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of compared to inventory and other assets increased by million  primarily the result of increased inventory levels required to satisfy customer demand 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  and was the result of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for year ended december  was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of raising million of net proceeds in september through the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a public offering and million from net proceeds from stock option exercises  our employee stock purchase program and reduction of notes receivable from stockholders 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million from the repayment of notes payable under our credit facility with greater bay bank 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of raising million in december through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock at per share in a public offering  debt proceeds of million which were primarily from our asset based credit facility with greater bay bank  and net proceeds from equity transactions of million  offset by debt repayments of million primarily against our asset based credit facility with greater bay bank and the million increase in restricted cash 
restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents used to collateralize standby letters of credit related to purchasing agreements with our suppliers 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we repaid all of our outstanding debt in the amount of million under our credit facilities with the chase manhattan bank and access technology partners and we repaid million of other debt 
we believe that our cash resources of million at december   together with anticipated operating profits and increases in working capital including funds available under our bank and vendor credit 
table of contents facilities  will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next twelve months 
while we have improved asset management over the past twelve months dso s may vary in the range of to days during the next twelve months 
purchase commitments we purchase substantially all of our flash memory from samsung pursuant to a supply agreement that expires on march  unless extended by mutual agreement 
samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of flash memory production capacity to us 
under the supply agreement  our purchases are priced based upon an agreed upon methodology and samsung provides us with intellectual property indemnification for the products we purchase from them 
either party can terminate the supply agreement in the event of the other party s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy 
we are not obligated to purchase minimum volumes of flash memory 
we also have a supply agreement with umc through december  under which we purchase controllers 
the purchase commitment for such controllers is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon based on a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders 
we depend on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital media products 
we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors 
instead  we procure services from these subcontractors on a per order basis 
the following table outlines our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands total amount committed less than year years years after years contractual obligations and commercial commitments operating leases net of sublease income unconditional purchase obligations standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations as described above 
indemnifications we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
typically these obligations arise in connection with sales contracts and license agreements under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against any losses incurred as a result of a claim by any third party with respect to our products 
we also typically agree to pay any costs incurred in defense of any such claim 
the terms of the indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement 
in certain cases  there are limits and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  the amounts required to defend indemnification claims have been insignificant 
accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for these indemnification obligations as of december  
table of contents we have agreements whereby our directors and officers are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum amount of future payment we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of december  warranties we provide warranties that range from one year for card readers to lifetime warranties for our professional products 
warranty costs are the costs to rework or scrap returned inventories 
we have historically experienced minimal warranty costs and warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements

table of contents risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our operating results and gross margins may fluctuate significantly in the future and are difficult to predict 
if our future results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our operating results and gross margins may vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors related to our industry and the markets for our products 
we will have little or no control over many of these factors and any of these factors could cause our operating results and gross margins  and consequently the price of our common stock  to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include  among others increases in the price of flash memory that we buy or the failure of cost decreases to keep up with price decreases for our products  fluctuation in demand for our products  including seasonal demand for our products and the volume and timing of potential retail customer and distributor orders  competitive pricing pressures for the products we sell  the rate of growth of the market for digital cameras  digital film and usb flash drives  the availability of flash memory  particularly flash memory that meets our technological requirements  the amount of price protection  volume incentive rebates  discounts  market development funds  cooperative advertising payments and other concessions and discounts that we may need to provide to some of our customers due to competitive pricing pressures  the timing and manner of revenue recognition for any given customer  including the deferral of revenue from new customers until the product is sold to their customers or our inability to accurately estimate appropriate reductions in product revenue based upon historical experience which may lead to the deferral of revenue from our customers until product is sold to their customers  availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity and product components to meet customer demand  the difficulty of forecasting sell through rates of our products and their impact on inventory levels at our distributors and customers  which may result in additional orders being delayed or reduced and inventory being returned  the timing and amount of expenses related to obsolescence and disposal of excess inventory and the difficulty of forecasting and managing our inventory levels  including inventories on consignment  the timing and amount of any reductions in the average selling prices of our products and services  the mix of business between retail  oem and licensing  our ability to estimate revenue reserves for product sales to certain customers  price reductions in key components  such as flash memory  could result in reduced margins when selling products that include previously purchased components held in inventory  increases in costs charged by our component or card suppliers or the failure of our suppliers to decrease the prices they charge to us when industry prices decline  the timing and amount of orders and cancellations from existing and new customers  
table of contents the commencement of  involvement in or the expansion of our litigation  any changes in the trend of declining average selling prices per unit sold of digital storage media  competing flash card standards  which displace the standards used in our products  shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products  exchange rate fluctuations  particularly the us dollar to british pound and japanese yen and the british pound to euro exchange rates  the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by competitors  potential product quality problems which could raise return or rework costs  and whether we can sell controllers in the volumes and at the prices we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of the emerging nature of our market  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues and gross margins 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed and we may not be able to adjust them quickly to meet a shortfall in revenues during any particular quarter 
we also plan inventory levels based on anticipated demand for our products and on anticipated product mix 
as we anticipate increased demand for certain products we invest more heavily  so the risk of an error in forecasted demand is greater 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses and planned inventories would decrease our net income or increase our operating losses and harm our financial condition 
declines in our operating results or gross margins may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  which would be likely to cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we primarily depend upon samsung for our flash memory 
if samsung is unable to provide us with sufficient quantities of flash memory when we need it at prices and sales terms that allow us to be competitive in the marketplace  if samsung is unable to remain technologically competitive  or if samsung were to reduce or eliminate our credit terms  we would not be able to manufacture and deliver digital media to our customers in accordance with their volume  price and schedule requirements which would have a serious negative impact on our revenues and margins 
as a result of the supply agreement we entered into with samsung in april  it is our primary supplier of flash memory  which is the primary cost of our digital media 
we expect that the demand for flash memory during  and particularly in the first half of  will be substantially greater than the supply of flash memory due to the continuing demand for digital cameras  increased use of flash memory in cellular phones and other digital consumer products  and increasing demand for usb flash drives 
shortages of flash memory now exist 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of flash memory from samsung or from another flash memory supplier in a timely manner and at competitive prices  we will not be able to manufacture and deliver flash memory products to satisfy our customers requirements 
although a number of semiconductor companies have announced their intention to manufacture flash memory that would meet our needs  samsung and toshiba currently control virtually all of the market for flash memory for our products 
even when additional flash memory capacity becomes available from new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to supply our flash memory needs at competitive prices if we cannot obtain adequate supplies from samsung 
even if we are able to obtain flash memory in sufficient volumes and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we cannot assure you that the prices charged by samsung or other suppliers will enable us to compete effectively in our market 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of our customers or supply digital media to them in the volumes they request  they will likely reduce future orders or eliminate us as a supplier 
our reputation would likely also be harmed and we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers 
if we are unable to obtain flash memory at economical prices  our gross margins would decline unless we could raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner or offset the cost increases elsewhere 
the existing competitive conditions may not permit us to do so  which would adversely impact our revenues and gross margins 

table of contents in addition  if samsung does not offer us prices  sales terms and credit terms that are appropriate to meet our growing needs  we might have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing 
furthermore  if samsung is unable to increase its output of flash memory in a manner commensurate with our needs  or to manufacture flash memory that is technologically and price competitive  or if it has any interruptions in shipment for any reason  we would be unable to satisfy our customers requirements 
for example  samsung has been emphasizing smaller flash geometries over multi level cell technology 
if multi level cell technology can be manufactured in volume at high yields  it could offer significant cost advantages over single level cell technologies 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of our customers  they may reduce any future orders or eliminate us as a supplier 
our reputation would likely also be harmed and we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers 
samsung has from time to time considered directly entering the retail market for flash media  which would make it a direct competitor to us 
samsung and other current and potential suppliers of flash memory are located in asia  a region that has been  and in the future may be  affected by economic and political instability that could adversely affect the price and supply of flash memory 
the solid state storage market is evolving and we may not have rights to manufacture and sell certain types of flash card formats or we may be forced to pay a royalty to sell digital film in these formats 
future digital film formats may not use our core technology 
many new digital cameras and other consumer devices now use emerging flash card formats such as the secure digital card or the xd picture card formats  which we do not currently manufacture and do not have rights to manufacture 
the secure digital card  for example  was introduced by a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba 
the consortium charges license fees to other companies that want to manufacture this product 
the secure digital card and the xd picture card have rapidly gained broad consumer acceptance 
this has resulted  and will likely continue to result in a decline in demand  on a relative basis  for products that we manufacture 
we currently source such products from third parties 
products we purchase and resell have significantly increased as a percentage of our total net revenues 
until we begin to manufacture such products ourselves  we expect that products that we purchase and resell will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues  which will negatively impact our gross product margin 
we expect to begin the manufacture of additional flash card formats during the first half of  though we may be unable to secure licensing arrangements that give us the right to manufacture these new or other future formats at reasonable rates or at all 
we believe that one of our advantages is our ability to offer retailers all major flash card formats  and if we were unable to supply all flash card formats at competitive prices or if we were to have product shortages  our margins would be adversely impacted and our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us 
if we are unable to generate increased revenue from licensing our intellectual property  our gross margins and profitability would be negatively impacted 
we have historically derived the substantial majority of our licensing revenue from a limited number of sources 
if we fail to generate significant licensing revenues or increase the revenues we derive from our higher margin controller sales  we may not grow our revenues and margins as planned 
in march  we executed a license agreement with samsung that provided for fixed license payments through march  and variable based royalties thereafter 
whether we will be paid any royalties under the variable based royalty obligations depends on many factors  including which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market share and our aggregate purchases from samsung 
we expect royalties from samsung after march  to be minimal 
as our licensing revenue declines  our revenues  gross margins and earnings will be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to secure new license or royalty revenues 

table of contents our unit volume has increased substantially in recent periods and has strained our operations infrastructure and our supply chain 
in recent periods  the number of units we manufacture on a weekly basis has increased significantly  particularly during the second half of this significant increase in growth has strained our supply chain and operational capabilities 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture cards at levels necessary to sustain our increased growth 
our component suppliers may not be able to keep up with the growth in our need for parts 
our other vendors  such as those that package our products  also may have trouble meeting our additional demands on them 
if we are not able to continue to accommodate this increased unit demand from our customers  we may have product shortages 
if we were to have product shortages  our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us 
if we are unable to manufacture products at rates sufficient to keep up with our component purchases  we may have too much inventory that would later need to be written down if component prices decrease 
in addition  we must continue to make significant investments in our existing internal information management systems to support increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the improvement in economic conditions will likely extend the lead time for procuring components 
if we do not plan properly or if the demand rises too quickly  we will face material shortages 
we market our digital media primarily on the basis of its superior technology 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain technological leadership  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
we market our digital media primarily on the basis of its performance and technology advantage over our competitors products 
in doing so  we have emphasized our speed and other advantages over our competitors products and have tried to establish ourselves as the brand of choice among professional photographers 
we label our compactflash and some of our jumpdrive and secure digital card products for sustained write speed performance in which x is equal to a write speed of kilobytes per second  nomenclature similar to that used in the cd rom industry 
for example  our x compactflash digital film is capable of sustained write speeds of at least kilobytes per second 
currently  we offer compactflash with write speeds ranging from x to x 
our highest capacity card is currently gigabytes 
from time to time our competitors have introduced products for which they have claimed high  sustained write speeds 
if we are unable to design and manufacture products that are technologically superior to those of our competitors or if we lose our status as a brand preferred by professional photographers  we will be unable to achieve a premium price for our products 
if this were to occur  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
increased competition in the digital media market may lead to a decrease in our revenues and market share 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  supply shortages or oversupply  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our existing competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have longer operating histories and greater brand name recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with retailers  oems and end users 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines  ensure more stable supply  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we may 
ultimately  this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share 
our primary competitors are companies that sell flash media into the mass market  photo and oem channels 
many of these companies are manufacturers with both controller and flash memory capabilities  such as infineon  renesas  samsung  sandisk and toshiba 
samsung has begun to sell flash cards in larger volumes to third parties  including to our competitors  and has publicly announced its intention to sell flash cards directly to retail customers 
renesas has recently made several announcements that suggest that it has increased its commitment to the manufacture of flash memory 
other well known semiconductor companies  including hynix  infineon and micron  have also indicated that they may enter the nand flash market 
sandisk and toshiba 
table of contents jointly develop and manufacture both low cost and high performance flash memory 
because flash memory represents a significant portion of the cost of flash media  sandisk and other flash manufacturers may have a competitive advantage and may have access to flash memory at prices substantially below the prices that samsung will charge to us 
we also face significant competition from manufacturers or card assemblers and resellers that either resell flash cards purchased from others or assemble cards from controllers and flash memory chips purchased from companies such as renesas  samsung or toshiba  into flash cards 
these companies include crucial  dane elec  delkin devices  kodak  feiya  fuji  hagiwara  hewlett packard  data i o  infineon  kingston  m systems  matsushita  memorex  memory plus  micron  pny  pqi  pretec  ritek  samsung  silicon storage technology  simpletech  smart modular technologies  sony  tdk  transcend  viking interworks and many others 
in addition  an increasing number of companies are manufacturing their own controllers  including genesys  hyperstone  kingston  oti  prolific  sandisk  sigmatel  silicon storage technology and solid state system 
such companies either combine their controller with flash memory from third parties to manufacture their own flash cards or sell their controllers to third parties who use them to assemble flash cards 
additionally  major semiconductor companies such as hynix  infineon  micron  renesas  samsung and toshiba have also developed or are currently developing their own controllers that will likely compete with our controller and or card sales 
furthermore  many companies have introduced usb flash drives that compete directly with our jumpdrive line of products 
these include apacer  belkin  fuji  iomega  jmtek  kti networks  m systems  netac  pny  samsung  sandisk  simpletech  sony  trek and many others 
our competitors have also introduced certain flash card formats 
for example  a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba have developed the secure digital card  a media format used in digital cameras as well as in other electronic applications  and fuji and olympus introduced the xd picture card 
another group of companies has recently introduced the fish drive  which is a miniature usb drive 
although we currently sell these flash memory products with the exception of the fish drive  which we source from third parties  we do not currently manufacture them  and we may not be able to do so in the future at a reasonable rate or at all 
by many estimates  these two products may comprise over half of the worldwide market for flash cards in if we are unable to obtain the rights to manufacture these products  our business will be adversely affected 
kodak and fuji are the largest and best known manufacturers of traditional film products 
kodak and fuji have entered the us digital media market  but do not yet manufacture their own digital media 
kodak has announced that it plans to build on its digital strategy with investments and purchases as it aims to be the number one player in digital photography 
with their resources and worldwide brand recognition  either kodak or fuji would be formidable competitors for our core business 
several companies such as cornice  ibm  and matrix semiconductor have introduced competing technologies for use in digital cameras 
these include products such as digital capture technology and the microdrive 
although the cost per megabyte of rotating media such as digital capture technology and the microdrive is lower than that of flash cards  rotating media has historically had higher power consumption and lower reliability than flash cards 
compact discs can also be used as a storage medium for digital cameras and other devices  and  while inexpensive  are quite bulky 
we expect to continue to face competition from existing or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative data storage solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs one of these alternative competing standards into its products  the digital media we manufacture  as currently configured  will not be compatible with that product and our revenues may decline 

table of contents if we are unable to continue to develop  competitively market and sell our jumpdrive portable flash storage product line  our revenues  gross margins and profitability would be negatively impacted 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and gross margin from sales of our jumpdrive flash storage products 
we believe that the market for flash storage will become increasingly competitive  and if we cannot continue to develop  market and sell these products  our revenues  gross margins and profits may decline 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future capital needs  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  expand our operations beyond our current expectations or respond to competitive pressures 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we currently anticipate that this amount  together with funds available under our bank and vendor credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the next months 
however  we might need to raise additional funds prior to the expiration of this period to fund growth beyond our current expectations 
if we were required to raise additional funds  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt securities  or warrants or otherwise  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to maintain our product development schedule  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business 
if we are unable to develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new products or services that are accepted by our customers and consumers  we will not be able to compete effectively in our market 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products that shorten product life cycles and tend to decrease average selling prices 
to remain competitive in this demanding market  we must continually design  develop and introduce new products and services that meet the performance and price requirements of our customers and consumers 
for example  as the number of flash card formats proliferates  it puts significant additional strain on our engineering group to design controllers for each format 
any significant delay or failure in releasing new products or services would harm our reputation  provide a competitor a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
also  we cannot assure you that any products or services we do introduce will gain market acceptance 
the introduction of new products is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee advances in technology and the adoption of new standards  to coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships and to identify and eliminate design and product flaws 
we may not be able to recoup research and development expenditures if our new products or services are not widely accepted 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain profitability in future periods  and we will likely use cash for operations 
our ability to sustain profitability depends on the rate of price decreases for our products  the growth of the markets for digital cameras  digital film and digital storage media  the extent to which our products  particularly our higher margin products  are accepted by these markets  our ability to charge a premium for our higher performance products and our ability to adequately control our operating expenses  particularly our litigation costs 
we also must continue to reduce the costs of producing and selling our digital film products by controlling our internal and channel inventory  securing the best available pricing for flash memory and components used in our digital media products and reducing our manufacturing costs 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing revenues from our higher margin products and controlling our operating expenses  we may not be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 

table of contents our products are characterized by average selling prices that have historically declined over relatively short time periods 
if we are unable to effectively manage our inventories  reduce our costs  introduce new products with higher average selling prices or increase our sales volumes  our revenues and gross margins will be negatively impacted 
consumers continue to exert pressure on digital camera manufacturers and on us to lower prices of digital photography products  such as our digital film  to prices comparable to those of traditional photography products 
our competitors also impose pricing pressures on us 
often these pricing pressures have been possible as a result of lower flash memory costs  but if flash memory costs rise we will experience additional margin pressure 
in addition  because a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily retail consumer chains  distributors and large oems  these customers have exerted  and we expect they will continue to exert  pressure on us to make price concessions 
in the past we have significantly reduced the prices of many of our flash products from time to time  and we may need to continue to do so to remain competitive 
any reduction in prices by us will hurt our gross margins unless we can manage our internal and channel inventories and our cost structure to minimize the impact of such price declines and reduce our costs 
we also sell our products to certain customers on a consignment basis  which has resulted in us carrying higher inventory levels 
if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices or increase the sales volume of our existing products  our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decline in this may negatively impact our anticipated growth in product revenues as well as our gross margins  particularly if the decline in our average selling prices is not matched by price declines in our component costs  primarily the cost of flash memory 
because we protect many of our retail customers and distributors against the effects of price decreases on their inventories of our products  we have in the past and may in the future incur large price protection charges if we reduce our prices when there are large quantities of our products in our distribution channel 
more than half of our product sales in  and were made through distributors and retailers to which we have provided price protection 
price protection allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on our operating results 
further  in this environment  high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin 
during  we incurred approximately million  or of total net product revenue  in price protection charges  and during  we incurred approximately million  or of total net product revenue  in price protection charges 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur price protection charges for the foreseeable future due to competitive pricing pressures 
if our price protection reserves are insufficient or we are not able to estimate future charges  our revenues and gross margins would be adversely affected in future periods 
because many of our retail customers and distributors have rights of return  we may be required to take back large quantities of unsold customer inventory  which could reduce our revenues 
substantially all of our sales of our digital media products to end users are made through distributors and retailers 
our sales through these channels often include rights to return unsold customer inventory 
for sales of some of our products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products  although we establish reserves for estimated returns 
additionally  we permit some of our customers to return products in their inventory for credit or in exchange for new products 
if there are significant inventories of old products in our distribution channel when a new product is released  or if these distributors and retailers are unsuccessful in selling our products  there could be substantial product returns 
if our reserves are insufficient to account for these returns or if we are unable to resell these products on a timely basis at similar prices  our revenues may be reduced 
because the market for our products is rapidly evolving  we may not be able to resell returned products at attractive prices or at all 

table of contents if our customers elect to compete with us in the digital media market  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
we sell our controllers to companies that use our controllers to manufacture flash card products 
many of these customers are large companies that have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and longer standing relationships with customers 
if these companies were to choose to compete directly with us in the digital media market or in our retail channels  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
during  sales to the ten customers from which we received the greatest revenues accounted for approximately of our total gross revenues 
our revenues could decline if one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce  delay or cancel their orders  decide to purchase digital media manufactured by one of our competitors  develop and manufacture their own digital media or cease operations due to the downturn in the global economy or otherwise 
in addition  we do not carry credit insurance on our accounts receivables and any difficulty in collecting outstanding amounts due from our customers  particularly customers that place larger orders or experience financial difficulties  could adversely affect our revenues and our net income 
because our sales are made by means of standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts  we cannot assure you that these customers will continue to purchase quantities of our products at current levels  or at all 
furthermore  our revenues include sales to oems  some of which have  or may in the future  decide to compete against us in the digital media market 
we expect our operating results for at least the next several years to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers 
if we are unable to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to develop  sell and market products that are commercially viable and widely accepted  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we may not be able to develop and sell products that are commercially viable and widely accepted if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers  digital camera manufacturers  flash memory manufacturers and other suppliers to ensure that critical development  marketing and distribution projects proceed in a coordinated manner 
this collaboration is also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our development activities depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to information derived from strategic relationships we currently have with digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
this collaboration can be difficult because many of these companies are located in europe or asia 
if any of our current relationships terminate or otherwise deteriorate  or if we are unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with comparable insight into market trends  we will be hindered in our product development efforts 
we rely to a significant degree on retailers to sell our digital media products 
we sell a significant percentage of our digital media products through retailers  most notably compusa  dixons group plc office max  ritz camera centers  target and wal mart  rather than through oems 
sales to retailers subjects us to many special risks  including the following loss of market share if the retailers that carry our products do not grow as quickly and sell as many digital media products as the retailers that carry the digital media products of our competitors  loss of business if we are unable to satisfy the product needs of these customers  product returns could increase as a result of our strategic interest in assisting retailers in balancing their inventories  
table of contents reduced ability to forecast sales  reduced gross margins  delays in collecting receivables and increased inventory levels due to the increasing tendency for some retailers to require products on a consignment basis  retailers may emphasize our competitors products over our products  or decline to carry our products  and continued downward pricing pressure in the retail channel has and could continue to necessitate price protection of the inventories of our products that many of our customers carry 
because we depend on single suppliers for some key components and products and do not have long term supply contracts with those suppliers  we are exposed to the risks of a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
we have a sole source of supply for each of the following components transistors for our compactflash and connectivity products  connectors for our jumpdrive pro and cf type ii products  the interface circuit for our jumpdrive music products  and the switches for our memory stick products 
we rely on additional vendors for other critical components 
because we depend on single suppliers for certain key components  and do not have a long term supply contract with these suppliers  we face the risk of inadequate component supply  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
any supplier may terminate their relationships with us or pursue other relationships with our competitors  and if we were to lose our relationship with these single suppliers  the lead time required to qualify new suppliers could be as long as three months 
also  if we lose our single suppliers or these suppliers are otherwise unable to satisfy our volume and delivery schedule requirements  it may be difficult to locate any suppliers who have the ability to develop  manufacture and deliver the specialized components we need for our products 
if we are unable to accurately predict our supply needs  or if our supply of components is disrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers 
we also do not currently manufacture certain flash cards  such as the memory stick duo  memory stick pro  secure digital card  mini secure digital  smartmedia card and xd picture card  with our own controllers 
until we are able to develop our own flash memory controller for these and other products  we must purchase such cards from third parties for resale 
we do not have long term supply contracts with all of these suppliers  and therefore face the risks of inadequate supply  price increases  late delivery or unavailability 
if our supply of such products is disrupted  we will lose existing customers and may be unable to replace them or to attract new ones 
we depend primarily on united microelectronics corporation  or umc  to manufacture our controllers  and if we are unable to obtain from umc sufficient quantities of controllers at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility  or fab 
instead  we rely primarily on a foundry  umc  to produce the majority of our controller products 
our reliance on an independent foundry involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies 

table of contents we have entered into a supply agreement with umc under which we are obligated to provide umc with a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders 
such forecasts may only be changed by a certain percentage each month 
this limits our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products 
if umc were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our controllers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we might not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
we have qualified other fabs  but we cannot assure you that they will have sufficient capacity to accommodate our demand at any particular time 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  we may incur significant expenses to secure access to manufacturing services  which in turn may cause our product costs to increase substantially 
we expect that the demand for capacity at these facilities will change in the near future due to fluctuating demand for consumer electronic and industrial products that depend on semiconductors manufactured at these facilities 
all of these foundries are located in an area of the world that may be subject to political and economic instability  the sars epidemic and natural disasters  particularly earthquakes 
while the last major earthquake in taiwan did not have a significant impact on deliveries to us from umc  a similar event in the future at one of their foundries could have a significant impact 
we depend solely on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital media products  which could result in product shortages or delays or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
our flash cards are primarily assembled and tested by pc partner in china  venture manufacturing services in singapore and indonesia  and venture manufacturing  vitron  macrotron and pc partner in the united states 
we do not have a long term agreement with vitron  venture manufacturing or pc partner and typically obtain services from them on a per order basis 
additionally  our controllers are assembled  tested and packaged primarily by advanced semiconductor engineering in taiwan  advanced interconnection technologies in indonesia and in the united states 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  inventory levels and costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
if these subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide assembly and test services and deliver products of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify other subcontractors 
this could be time consuming and difficult and result in unforeseen operations problems 
our failure to successfully promote our brand and achieve strong brand recognition in target markets could limit or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we believe that brand recognition will be important to our ability to succeed as the digital photography and the digital media markets continue to develop 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing programs to create and maintain prominent brand awareness 
if we fail to promote our brand successfully  or if the expenses associated with doing so become increasingly high  our business may not grow as we anticipate 
other companies  who may have significantly more resources to promote their own brands than we do  may not be aggressively promoting their flash card brands 
if they begin to more aggressively promote their brand or if our products exhibit poor performance or other defects  our brand may be adversely affected  which would inhibit our ability to attract or retain customers 
if we encounter difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy  we may need to grant large stock based incentives that could be dilutive to our stockholders and we may be required to pay significant salaries which would increase our general and administrative costs 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including eric b 
stang  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer  and 
table of contents petro estakhri  our chief technology officer and executive vice president of engineering 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we may have difficulty implementing portions of our business strategy in a timely manner  or at all 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses to attract and retain these individuals  which could harm our operating results 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  we will not be able to grow our business 
if our products contain defects  we may incur unexpected and significant operating expenses to correct the defects  we may be required to pay damages to third parties and our reputation may suffer serious harm 
although the digital media products that we manufacture are tested after they are assembled  these products are extremely complex and may contain defects 
these defects are particularly likely when new versions or enhancements are released 
the sale of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for example  if there are defects in our products that cause loss of data  customers may lose their digital images stored on our digital media 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and management resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
products we source from others may have defects that we cannot quickly fix and that will require us to return them to the manufacturer  which could result in delayed product shipments and damage to our reputation 
our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  and it may be difficult for us to anticipate demand and pricing in those regions or effectively manage the distributor channels and relationships in those regions 
total net revenues outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total net revenues for the year ended december  we generated a majority of our international revenues from product sales in europe and from product sales and licensing agreements in asia 
the european and asian markets are intensely competitive 
one of our principal growth strategies is to expand our presence in this and other international markets both through increased international sales and strategic relationships 
for example  we are expanding distribution of our products into latin america  china  the middle east and eastern europe 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  delays in meeting customer commitments due to difficulties associated with managing an international distribution system  increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices that are common in many international markets  difficulties associated with managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  natural disasters  political uncertainties and changing regulatory environments in foreign countries  and difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries 

table of contents in addition  if we are unable to accurately anticipate demand and pricing of products in international markets  or if we cannot work effectively with our distribution partners to create demand  develop effective marketing programs  manage inventory levels and collect receivables in a timely fashion  our operating results will be harmed and our stock price will likely decline 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could result in a reduction in sales and profitability 
although  the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars  we also have product sales denominated in british pounds  euros and other european currencies  as well as the japanese yen 
to the extent our prices are denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and japanese yen  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
we have foreign subsidiaries in great britain and japan that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates for our sales as well as our costs denominated in those currencies 
we use forward contracts  to manage the exposures associated with our net asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
risks related to our industry our business will not succeed unless the digital photography market continues to grow and is accepted by professional  commercial and consumer users 
we currently depend on sales of digital media and connectivity products to digital camera owners for a substantial portion of our revenues  which exposes us to substantial risk in the event the digital photography market does not grow rapidly 
the digital photography market is in an early stage of development and is rapidly evolving 
the success of this market depends on many factors  including the ability of digital cameras to take high quality photographs  the availability of digital cameras at prices and with performance characteristics comparable to traditional cameras  the availability of digital media that meet users requirements with respect to price  speed  connectivity  capacity and compatibility  the speed at which digital cameras are able to take successive photographs  the ease with which digital files can be transferred to a personal computer or printer  the availability of digital image prints comparable in quality and price to traditional photographs  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition to the above factors related to the digital photography market as a whole  we believe the following additional factors will affect the successful adoption of digital photography by consumers marketing campaigns that increase brand awareness in end user markets  both domestically and internationally  increased association between brand names and attractive price and performance characteristics  and heightened consumer confidence in digital photography technology 

table of contents although other applications such as cell phones  pdas and mp players may consume large volumes of flash cards in the near future  today the digital photography market remains the primary driver of demand for flash cards 
if the digital photography market does not continue to grow and be accepted by professional  commercial and consumer users  or if any reduction in demand in digital photography is not absorbed by other new applications  our revenues will be adversely affected 
general economic conditions  political and military conditions associated with current worldwide conflicts and similar events may prevent consumers from purchasing our products and reduced demand for digital media and related products may prevent us from achieving targeted revenues and profitability 
sales of consumer electronic products have historically been dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
the recent decline in consumer confidence and the continuing slowdown in the united states economy may cause consumers to defer decisions to purchase our products 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of recent economic  political and social turmoil  consumers may reduce discretionary spending and may not purchase our products  which would harm our revenues 
our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for flash cards and related products 
our customers decisions to purchase our products are largely discretionary 
the slowdown in the us and global economy may cause customers to defer or alter purchasing decisions  and accordingly could reduce demand for our products 
softening demand for these products caused by worsening economic conditions has resulted in the past  and may again in the future  result in decreased revenues 
our stock price and those of other technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in august many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders or customers  sales of common stock by our officers and directors  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our operating results and our business 

table of contents if digital camera manufacturers do not develop and promote products that are able to take advantage of our fastest digital film products  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we depend on the research and development  marketing and sales efforts of digital camera manufacturers in developing  marketing and selling digital cameras that can use our more advanced existing and future products 
most of the digital cameras currently available on the market do not incorporate technologies that can take advantage of the speed available in our fastest digital film products 
if digital camera manufacturers do not successfully develop  market and sell digital cameras that take full advantage of our most advanced products  from which we realize higher gross margins  the growth and success of our business may be negatively impacted 
the manufacturing of our products is complex and subject to yield problems  which could decrease available supply and increase costs 
the manufacture of flash memory and controllers is a complex process  and it is often difficult for companies to achieve acceptable product yields 
reduced flash memory yields could decrease available supply and increase costs 
controller yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
because low yields may result from either design defects or process difficulties  we may not identify yield problems until well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists and can be analyzed and tested 
in addition  many of these yield problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our ability to successfully compete in our market 
we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to successfully compete in our market 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
as of february   we had been granted or allowed patents in the united states and other countries and had more than pending united states and foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you  however  that any of our existing or future patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  or our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 
it may also be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
we are involved in intellectual property litigation  and expect to become involved in additional litigation that could divert management s time and attention  be time consuming and expensive to defend and limit our access to important technology 
we are a party to litigation with third parties to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
we expect to be involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
these lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages 
these lawsuits could also lead to the invalidation of our patent rights 
patent lawsuits are extremely expensive and time consuming and can divert management s time and attention 
when we sue other companies for patent infringement  it may prompt them to 
table of contents respond by suing us for infringement of their patents 
we are also negotiating license agreements with third parties  which could result in litigation if these negotiations are unsuccessful 
additional patent litigation would significantly increase our legal expenses  which would result in higher operational expenses and lower operating margins 
we are currently in patent litigation with toshiba 
in this litigation  we have asserted that toshiba infringes thirteen of our patents through their sale of flash memory chips  cards and cameras 
in a separate action  toshiba has asserted that we infringe eight of toshiba s patents through our sale of flash devices that we manufacture and readers 
such products comprise a substantial portion of our revenues 
if we were found to infringe toshiba s patents or if we were involved in other intellectual property litigation  we could be forced to do one or more of the following pay damages on products that were found to infringe the other party s patents  stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  we may incur additional costs or be unable to manufacture and sell our products 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we sell our products primarily to customers in the us and  to a lesser extent  europe  japan and canada 
most of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  however  we anticipate an increasing amount of our sales will be denominated in british pounds  the japanese yen  the euro  the canadian dollar and possibly latin american currencies 
foreign currency denominated revenues were approximately  and of our total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchase our products and the materials and services to build our products primarily from vendors in korea  taiwan  indonesia  china  the united states  germany and japan 
most of these costs are currently denominated in us dollars  however  we anticipate an increasing amount of our costs will be denominated in the euro  japanese yen and possibly other currencies 
foreign currency denominated costs were approximately  and of our cost of product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result  it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar rises in comparison to the local currency  which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
conversely  the prices of our products would become less expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar falls in comparison to the local currency  which may make it easier to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
these risks could become more significant as we expand business outside the us or if we increase sales in non us dollar denominated currencies 
we have adopted and implemented a hedging policy to mitigate these potential risks 
we use forward contracts to mitigate the exposures associated with certain net foreign currency asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented  or may implement in the future  will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december   we entered into hedges on intercompany payables denominated in the british pound and japanese yen 
during the year ended december   the foreign currency exposures on our net asset and liability positions were not fully hedged 
for the year ended december   foreign exchange gains on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were and were offset by losses on hedging transactions of approximately million 
for the year ended december   gains on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were million and were offset by losses on hedging transactions of million 
we had no foreign exchange gains or losses on hedging transactions for the year ended december  as of december   we held forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of million to hedge the risks associated with forecast british pound and japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities 
at december   our aggregate exposure to non us dollar currencies  net of currency hedge contracts  was approximately million 
if  at december   we applied an immediate adverse move in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to these exposures  we would incur a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we earn on our investments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates impacts all of our investments because of the short duration of the investments 
accordingly  our interest rate risk is primarily related to our cash and cash equivalents  which amounted to million at december  at december   we had no amounts outstanding under our facility with silicon valley bank 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically invested in investment grade  short term securities that we have held until maturity to limit our market risk 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
