our business is subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion and the section in item of this report entitled business risks describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteorites 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to create a unique brand image which positions moissanite as a jewel in its own right  distinct from all other jewels based on its fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
we began shipping moissanite to domestic retail jewelers and international distributors during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we changed our domestic distribution model to sell through jewel distributors and jewelry manufacturers rather than directly to retail stores 
in march  we entered into distribution agreements with stuller settings  inc stuller and rio grande  two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  for the north american distribution of moissanite 
we have also entered into several agreements with domestic jewelry manufacturers  including k g creations  which is currently our largest customer 
through these agreements with stuller  rio grande and jewelry manufacturers and the brand awareness created by our marketing program  we have sought to rapidly increase the introduction of moissanite into the domestic jewelry market while maintaining average selling prices 
although these new distribution and marketing strategies enabled us to achieve profitability in the three years ended december   we have no assurance that they will be successful in the long term 
in october  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong  charles colvard hk ltd  for the purpose of gaining better access to the important far eastern markets 
the importance of having a presence in this market is twofold  hong kong is the headquarters city for a very large number of jewelry manufacturing companies with sales and distribution worldwide  and hong kong is the gateway to the markets of mainland china 
to enhance our presence in this market  we established a charles colvard controlled company in china in august in  we dramatically cut marketing and sales expenses  primarily by discontinuing significant advertising and promotion expenses in favor of lower cost public relations and media editorial initiatives 
additionally  we lowered general and administrative costs through personnel reductions  and we realized significant savings by suspending all research and development efforts with cree 
domestic sales accounted for approximately of total sales in as we concentrated on growing our domestic business 
domestic distribution of moissanite expanded in into additional retail stores  including our first retail jewelry chain 
catalog sales of moissanite jewelry expanded significantly 
we demonstrated that with appropriate product mix and product positioning  home shopping channels were a viable distribution channel for jewelry featuring moissanite 
primarily as a result of these efforts  we became profitable and generated positive cash flow from operations in 
table of contents during  we continued our focus on the domestic market  while investing limited resources in certain international markets that show the most potential 
our sales were higher than sales in with sustained profitability and positive cash flow 
in  we increased our sales marketing expenses to expand product awareness and accelerate sales growth 
the majority of the increased expenses were focused on the domestic market  and we also increased our marketing and sales investment in hong kong china 
our sales were higher in over we hope that our increased investment in sales marketing expenses leads to an increased growth rate in and beyond 
although our goals for are to continue increasing sales while sustaining profitability  we cannot be sure that either goal will be achieved 
results of operations the following table is intended to illustrate a tabular analysis of certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of sales for all periods presented 
a detailed explanation of our results of operations follows this table 
year ended december  sales gross profit marketing sales expenses g a expenses operating income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although shipments of moissanite jewels decreased by in to approximately  carats from  carats in  sales increased due to a increase in the average selling price per carat 
the average selling price per carat increased primarily due to a product mix in which a greater percentage of larger size jewels  which have a higher price per carat  were sold 
domestic sales accounted for approximately of sales in and in domestic carat shipments in decreased by and international carat shipments were flat 
the decrease in domestic carat shipments during is due to decreased hours of moissanite sales broadcasting on the television shopping channel shopnbc 
shopnbc announced  starting in february  their intention to decrease jewelry as a percentage of total sales 
other domestic retail outlets showed sales growth in the moissanite category 
our two largest customers  k g creations and stuller  accounted for and  respectively  of our sales during k g creations  a domestic manufacturing customer  provides moissanite jewels and jewelry to a large and diversified customer base  including television shopping channels and traditional retail stores 
stuller  the largest supplier to domestic independent jewelers  provides both moissanite jewels and a limited line of moissanite jewelry to its customers 
while we believe our current relationship with these customers is good  and alternate manufacturers and distributors are available to serve their customer base  a loss of these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 
increased international sales into taiwan and vietnam were offset by a sales decrease into england 
the increase in taiwan can be attributed to the successful introduction of moissanite on a television shopping channel and the increase in vietnam is due to the opening of a moissanite only store in that country 
the reduced england sales were caused by a de emphasis of moissanite by our english manufacturer 
in  we have received indications from this manufacturer that it intends to re emphasize moissanite 

table of contents our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin percentage in was negatively impacted by the establishment of a  lower of cost or market reserve 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for an explanation of this reserve 
our gross margin percentage for would have been ignoring the effect of this inventory reserve 
the gross margin percentage in was adversely affected by decreased yields of moissanite jewels from sic crystals during the period being relieved from inventory september april under our first in  first out accounting policy  partially offset by the increase in the average selling price per carat 
while the company makes no prediction as to the future sales of moissanite jewels or the specific mix of sizes which will be sold  assuming a continuation of the company s sales levels and mix of sizes as experienced in  the company s inventory costs for the periods being relieved under the company s first in  first out accounting during will trend lower than the costs relieved during  with variations from quarter to quarter 
future gross margins will also fluctuate based upon our average selling price per carat 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to from in the primary reason for the increase was our advertising campaign designed to support the new jewelry chains that are testing moissanite jewelry and to stimulate moissanite tests by other chains 
our campaign featured a new advertising message and expanded the placement of advertisements in fashion magazines and billboards 
we incurred  of production costs associated with changing the look and feel of our advertising message 
the increased number of advertisement placements resulted in  of increased costs over during  we incurred  of increased marketing and sales costs over associated with the expansion of our offices in hong kong and china 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a  decrease in our co op advertising expense 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us 
the decrease in this expense during is due to the reduction in the amount of allowable credit given to one of our major customers 
in  we have budgeted approximately  in advertising costs  more than in and expect to continue our strategy of long term marketing and sales investments into hong kong and china 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although there was an increase in these expenses  as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased to from in increased professional fees of  were offset by decreased compensation costs of  pertaining to our executive compensation plan 
the primary reason for the increase in professional fees was legal fees of approximately  in related to the now settled litigation with c 
eric hunter  one of the founders of the company  and his wife  jocelyn hunter 
other than these legal fees  the settlement of the lawsuit did not have any material impact on our results of operations 
the plaintiffs alleged fraud and other actionable conduct 
our executive compensation plan was effective for  however  no costs were recorded in as the company did not meet its internal sales and profit goals 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate earned on our cash balances 
income tax expense was  for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   as discussed below 
our effective income tax rate for was 
this rate is higher than our statutory rate of due to our inability to deduct currently  of non us operating losses 

table of contents as a result of sustained profitability in and  we recorded a one time  non operating and non cash addition to earnings in the fourth quarter of to reflect the expected future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss carryforwards 
the benefit is due to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance that existed in prior periods 
we established a valuation allowance in prior periods due to the uncertainty of whether we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
we believe our sustained profitability in and was an indication that it became more likely than not that we would fully utilize our deferred tax assets 
recognition of this asset resulted in the recording of income tax expense in each quarter of and this expense will be recorded in all future profitable periods 
however  us federal income tax payments will only resume once the tax net operating loss carryforwards million at december  have been completely utilized or if alternative minimum taxes are applicable 
pro forma amounts are shown below to compare net income in vs 
 excluding this one time gain and as if we had recorded us income tax expense during utilizing a combined state and federal effective tax rate of of us taxable income 
management believes that this pro forma information is useful to investors in comparing results of operations on a us tax equivalent basis

shipments of moissanite jewels increased in to approximately  carats from  carats in domestic carat shipments  which represented of total shipments  increased by  and international carat shipments increased by 
the average selling price per carat decreased by  primarily due to increased sales of smaller jewels which have a lower price per carat 
increased domestic sales are primarily attributable to direct marketing efforts on the television shopping channels shopnbc and the shop at home network 
in addition  distribution has increased through our manufacturing partners at traditional retail stores 
one of our domestic manufacturing customers  k g creations  accounted for approximately of our sales during  while another  stuller settings  inc accounted for of sales 
k g creations provides moissanite jewels and jewelry to a large and diversified customer base  including television shopping channels and traditional retail stores 
international sales also increased due to increased sales through television shopping channels 
specifically  ideal world and the infomercial company  best direct  began selling moissanite jewels in the united kingdom in international sales also increased in hong kong  china  and italy 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross margin percentage was primarily caused by improved yields of moissanite jewels from sic crystals during the period being relieved from inventory april august under our first in  first out accounting policy  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per carat and the establishment of a  lower of cost or market reserve 

table of contents marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase resulted primarily from  of increased costs associated with our co op advertising program   of increased print media advertising  increased compensation including costs associated with the hiring of two sales and marketing executives and increased costs associated with our hong kong subsidiary 
our co op advertising program  which reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us  increased primarily as a result of higher sales to our customers 
our print media advertising expanded in into national magazines  jewelry trade publications  and newspapers in certain markets to support sales events

research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
we suspended development efforts with cree effective january   and terminated our development agreement with cree effective december  other expenses of  for the year ended december  resulted from the write off of certain patent costs and a loss on the disposition of certain other assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash and inventory account for of our current assets 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
during the year ended december   we used  of cash to fund operations 
the major components of the cash used were a  increase in inventory and a  increase in receivables  offset by pretax income of  in addition  we used  of cash for capital expenditures and patent and license rights costs 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to million in raw material purchases during  as described below 
the increase in receivables is primarily due to a  increase during in memo sales  as well as the timing of cash receipts 
our receivables balance should increase in due to increasing sales and expanded use of memo sales 
memo sales are discussed in more detail below 
see critical accounting policies and estimates 
in december  we agreed with cree on a framework for purchases for the company is obligated to purchase a minimum quantity of usable material on a quarterly basis if cree meets certain minimum quality levels 
for each quarter during  the company has committed to purchase between  and  of raw material depending upon the quality of material received 
if cree s material quality is consistent with that received in  future purchases are expected to be at the high end of this range 
our four year development agreement with cree  as amended  required us to fund a development program at cree for million annually through december  our funding obligations under the development agreement were suspended from january through december   and the agreement terminated at the end of in september  our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program 
the program authorized management  in its discretion  to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices at or below prevailing prices 
this program expired in september during  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of per share from an affiliate of chester lf paulson 
chester lf paulson was a director of the company from may through may he is no longer a director of the company 
during  the company repurchased  shares at an average price of under this program 
in october  our board of directors authorized a follow on repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
this program expired in september there were no shares repurchased during under the follow on program 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average cost of per share 
of this amount   shares were repurchased from an affiliate of chester lf paulson  at an average purchase price of per share 
in december  the board of directors authorized a follow on repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   there were no shares repurchased since the adoption of the follow on program 
management will determine the time and extent of any future repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and other working capital  management believes that our existing capital resources are adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations consist of our purchase commitments with cree  the operating lease on our building and the operating leases for our companies in hong kong and china 
below are the amounts of these commitments in tabular form 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase commitments operating leases during  we are committed to purchase between  and  of raw material each quarter depending upon the quality of material received 
if cree s material quality is consistent with that received in  future purchases are expected to be at the high end of this range 
the numbers in the table above are based on the high end of the range 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had a united states net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  which expires between and in accordance with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a change in equity ownership of greater than within a three year period will result in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards that were created during tax periods prior to the change in ownership 
as a result of various equity offerings and certain shareholder transactions  the utilization of a portion of our nol carryforwards has become limited  but this limitation will not have a material effect on our ability to utilize the nol carryforward 
as of december   there was approximately million in nol carryforwards in hong kong 
in accordance with the hong kong tax code  these amounts can be carried forwarded indefinitely to offset future taxable income in hong kong 
due to the uncertainty of sufficient future taxable income in hong kong to utilize this nol  we have established a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to costing and classification of inventories  revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  and co op advertising 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our inventories consist primarily of colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
moissanite jewels that do not meet our grading criteria and therefore are not deemed to be saleable are not included in inventories 
we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
as a result  our inventories do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
our distribution channels include two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  jewelry manufacturers  home shopping channels and catalogs 
consequently  significant amounts of inventories must be maintained at all times 
given our current assumptions  we believe that a substantial amount of inventories will be sold or consumed during our operating cycle  which is greater than one year 
however  no assurances can be given that this reduction will occur 
during  we established a lower 
table of contents of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain shapes and sizes of jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
the reserve is necessary to allow for the carat weight loss during the re cutting process 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
since the establishment of this reserve  we have not yet re cut any jewels 
at december   the reserve remained at  revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped 
from time to time  we ship certain items on memo terms 
for goods shipped on memo terms  the customer receives title to the goods and assumes the risk of loss  however  the customer has an absolute right of return during the specified memo period 
we recognize revenue on these transactions upon the earlier of the customer informing us that they will keep the product or the expiration of the memo period 
the gross profit associated with these memo sales is shown on the balance sheet as deferred gross profit 
this amount was  and  at december  and  respectively 
we expect these amounts to continue increasing in the future as we expand the distribution of moissanite into new outlets 
estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
first  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem collectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the second reserve against accounts receivable is the allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
this reserve has been reduced during due to fewer returns as a percentage of sales 
we offer a co op advertising program to our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
these amounts were  and  at december  and  respectively and are included on the balance sheet under accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer
