item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations we currently derive the majority of our revenues from sales of products and services to utilities 
however  our business may increasingly consist of sales to other energy and water industry participants such as energy service providers  end use customers  wholesale power market participants and others 
from through  our organizational structure consisted of business units that focus on the customer segments we serve 
these business units are electric  natural gas  water and public power  international and end user solutions 
the electric  natural gas  water and public power and end user solutions business units focus on the us and canadian business territories 
the international business unit focuses on sales outside of the us and canada 
sales revenues for each business unit may include hardware  software license  custom software development  field and project management service and engineering  consulting and installation service revenues 
service revenues include post sale maintenance support and outsourcing service revenue 
outsourcing services encompass installation  operation and maintenance of meter reading systems to provide meter information to a customer for billing and management purposes 
outsourcing services can be provided for systems we own as well as those owned by our customers 
inter business unit revenues are immaterial 
business unit hardware cost of sales are based on standard costs  which include materials  direct labor and an overhead allocation based on projected production for the year 
business unit cost of sales for software  professional services and maintenance are based on actual time and materials incurred  warranty expense and an allocation of miscellaneous service related costs 
miscellaneous hardware costs and variances from standard costs are included in corporate cost of sales and are not allocated to the business units 
in january  we began to implement a change in our organizational structure 
in the new structure  we are moving from profit and loss responsibility and reporting along business unit or market lines to two primary operations groups hardware and software 
the segment information presented in this form k is based on the organizational structure in place from through we expect to begin reporting under the new organization structure starting with the second quarter of at that time  historical amounts will be restated 
executive highlights in our revenues were million  which is higher than our revenues 
approximately half of the revenue growth resulted from three acquisitions  two in the fourth quarter of and one in the first quarter of  with the rest coming from increased amr business 
amr unit shipments increased approximately in compared with we had no customer representing more than of total company revenues in compared with one customer representing of revenues in total new order bookings were million in compared with million in while revenues increased in  our new order bookings and backlog declined primarily as three large electric utility customers delayed amr orders in as a result of delays in capital spending due to an ice storm  a large scale electrical power blackout in the eastern us and a hurricane 
we expect that certain of these order delays will continue to impact us in the first quarter of we expect that electric utilities will resolve many of these issues and that our electric market order activity will improve beginning in the second quarter of net income was million  or cents per diluted share in compared with million  or cents per diluted share  in despite strong revenue performance in  our earnings for the full year were impacted by a number of unusual charges 
these items consisted of the following an increase of million to an estimate for warranty expenses related to higher than normal product failures for a certain product 
impairment charges totaling million for minority investments in two companies 
the above charges were partially offset by a fourth quarter reversal of approximately million of management bonus and employee profit sharing accrued in the first three quarters of in early  we began to implement a new organizational structure 
in the process of implementing our new organization  and to adjust expenditures to expected revenue potential for in some areas  we have made headcount reductions and other spending adjustments 
revenues and gross margins total company revenues and gross margins the following tables summarize our revenues and gross margin for each year presented 
year ended december  change change in millions revenues sales service total revenues year ended december  change change gross margin sales service total gross margin revenues approximately half of the growth in revenues from to was driven by two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and one acquisition in the first quarter of the remaining revenue growth was driven by higher amr hardware revenues and royalty income  offset by lower revenues from installations related to meter reading systems 
sales revenues in increased million  or approximately  compared with amr module revenues increased million as module shipments increased to approximately million units in the three acquisitions above contributed million of the increase 
royalty revenue increased by million primarily due to increased shipments of solid state electricity meters with our amr technology embedded 
offsetting these increases were decreased amr installation revenues of million in compared with million in due to the completion of several large installation contracts 
revenues through indirect sales channels  which include sales through meter manufacturers  business associates and other alliance partners  increased to approximately million in  up from million in  and were and of total company revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
service revenues decreased slightly in primarily due to a decline in outsourcing service revenues 
the million  or increase in revenues in compared with principally reflects increased hardware deliveries to existing domestic customers of electric  gas and water amr modules 
one acquisition in the first quarter and two in the fourth quarter of contributed a combined million in revenues 
service revenues in included a million one time revenue increase related to a long term outsourcing contract 
there were no customers that accounted for more than of total company revenues in one group of affiliated electric business unit customers  national grid companies  accounted for approximately and of total company revenues in and  respectively 
the top ten customers in  and accounted for approximately  and of revenues for the respective periods 
gross margins gross margins in were negatively and significantly impacted by increased warranty expenses  which are reflected in service gross margins 
in  we began to experience high field failures for a specific type of electric amr module 
after extensive testing and analysis  we traced the source of the product failures to a change in encapsulation material from a supplier to our component supplier 
the defective material was used by the supplier for approximately twelve months 
certain lots of this electric amr module manufactured during this period included the defective material 
under certain conditions  primarily heat and humidity  there is a slow degradation of the material  which causes the product to fail 
the units containing the defective components are primarily isolated at four utilities and in we began a proactive program to replace affected modules at the two utilities that are experiencing the high failures 
we expect to complete the replacements midway through a warranty accrual of approximately million was charged to service cost of sales during the fourth quarter of  which reflects our estimate of the material  labor and other costs we will incur to replace the remaining affected units 
our estimates include assumptions for the number of units affected  hourly labor charges for installation work  in house material and labor costs to rework affected units  reimbursements from our component supplier and other variable factors 
while we believe we have adequately reserved for this issue based on the information that is available to us today  our actual costs may differ from our estimates 
warranty charges were the primary reason for the decrease in service gross margins from in to in sales gross margins increased  from in to in  from a combination of factors  including higher manufacturing volumes  lower general market prices for electronic components  higher product royalties and changes in product mix 
our gross margins may vary from period to period depending on the mix of hardware and software products and services 
gross margins improved to in compared with in from a combination of factors  including improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and changes in product mix  specific cost reduction efforts  lower general market prices for electronic components and other supply chain management initiatives 
service gross margins decreased in primarily due to a one time increase in costs associated with a long term service contract 
segment revenues and gross margins the following tables and discussion highlight significant changes in trends or components of revenues and gross margin for each segment 
year ended december  change change in millions segment revenues electric natural gas water and public power international end user solutions n a n a n a n a total revenues year ended december  change change segment gross margin electric natural gas water and public power international end user solutions n a n a n a n a corporate total gross margin corporate is included to reconcile total segment gross margin to total gross margin above 
electric revenues in increased million  or  compared with primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and one acquisition in the first quarter of  which in total contributed million more in revenues in than in sales of handheld computer systems were slightly higher in while maintenance services were lower due to initial warranty periods for new handheld system sales 
amr revenues increased only slightly in as several large electric utilities delayed orders due to several instances of extreme weather  a major blackout in the northeastern us and other utility specific delays in capital spending 
revenues in increased by million compared with  or  two thirds of which resulted from increased hardware shipments for amr  particularly with one customer 
also contributing to the increase in revenues was million related to an acquisition in the first quarter and two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of one customer represented approximately  and of electric business unit revenues in  and  respectively  and approximately  and of total company revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues under existing contracts with this customer were substantially recognized in late the electric business unit gross margin in decreased compared with primarily due to the increase in warranty expense discussed above under total company gross margin 
approximately million of the million fourth quarter warranty accrual is reflected in the electric business unit 
also contributing to lower electric business unit gross margin in were higher than normal installation costs on an amr contract with one customer due to poor productivity issues with a third party contractor 
late in  we switched to a new third party contractor to complete the project within a timeframe that was acceptable to the customer 
the poor productivity issues resulted in our incurring higher installation costs than originally budgeted 
in the fourth quarter of  we had million in costs for this contract that were in excess of revenues  approximately million of which is a forward loss accrual for the estimated operations 
we expect to complete the installation work for this contract around the end of the first quarter of also contributing to the lower electric business unit gross margin was a decrease in the average selling prices of electric meter modules in certain large orders 
these declines were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix and an increase in royalty revenues of approximately million  primarily from sem  in the improvement in electric business unit margins from to resulted primarily from lower standard hardware costs due to higher planned production volumes and other manufacturing efficiencies  as well as a shift in the mix of products and services 
natural gas revenues in increased approximately million  or  compared with primarily due to meter module deliveries related to ongoing and new amr projects 
revenue growth was from to and was driven by increased hardware deliveries under several large contracts 
in two customers represented approximately and of the natural gas business unit revenues  compared with one customer representing of natural gas business unit revenues in these customers represented of total company revenues in and there were no customers representing or more of the natural gas business unit s revenues in gross margins increased from to and from to due to lower standard hardware costs resulting primarily from higher planned production volumes 
amr module unit shipments were approximately higher in compared with  and shipments in were higher than in the increase in margin in was partially offset by approximately  in warranty expense that was reclassified from corporate because it relates to specific warranty exposure in this business unit 
as the warranty expense was originally recorded in corporate in  the reclassification in did not have an impact on total company warranty expense 
water and public power revenues in increased  compared with  primarily as a result of a increase in sales through our indirect channel 
revenues through indirect sales channels in were of water and public power business unit revenues and of total company revenues 
in and  revenues through indirect sales channels were and of water and public power business unit revenues and and of total company revenues  respectively 
gross margin was lower in compared with  as million of the million warranty expense issue discussed above under total company gross margin is reflected in this business unit  with additional decreases from lower margin hardware sales 
gross margin in was also negatively impacted by approximately  in warranty expense that was reclassified from corporate because it relates to specific warranty exposure in this business unit 
as the warranty expense was originally recorded in corporate in  the reclassification in did not have an impact on total company warranty expense 
in  gross margin was slightly lower than in as installation services  which are at a lower gross margin than hardware  were a higher component of overall revenues 
international during the fourth quarter of  we announced plans to restructure our european operations to improve the long term profitability and efficiency of international operations 
much of our efforts in were focused on completing that transformation 
revenues increased slightly in compared with due to sales from acquisitions 
total revenues decreased by million  or  in  compared with due to an million handheld meter reading system sale to a customer in japan in  which was not replaced with a comparable size order in gross margins in decreased due to lower margin handheld system sales  expansion of our service center in the netherlands  warranty charges related to products we are no longer selling or supporting and a lower amount of higher margin software sales 
margins were slightly higher in compared with due to a shift in product mix 
end user solutions as a result of the acquisition of silicon on march   we created the end user solutions business unit  which sells products and services to domestic commercial and industrial end use customers 
revenues were approximately million from march  through december   and sales consisted primarily of energy management software and services 
corporate miscellaneous hardware costs and variances from standard costs are reported within corporate cost of sales and are not allocated to the business units 
overall  corporate costs of sales were comparable as a percentage of revenue in  and corporate gross profit in reflects a reclassification of million in warranty expense from corporate to the natural gas and water and public power business units  because it relates to specific warranty exposures in those business units 
the warranty expense was originally recorded in corporate in the reclassification in did not have an impact on total company warranty expense 
in addition  in there was no bonus or profit sharing expense in corporate cost of sales  compared with million in and million in operating expenses the following table details our total operating expenses in dollars and as a percent of revenues 
certain amounts in and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
year ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue in millions operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructurings in process research and development n a litigation accrual n a total operating expenses operating expenses increased during and primarily due to three acquisitions in and one in sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in as a result of additional sales and marketing staff and product marketing activities primarily related to new products and services from acquisitions 
however  as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing increased only slightly from to these increases in expenses were partially offset by no bonus and profit sharing expense in  compared with million and  in and  respectively 
product development expenses increased million  or  in and million  or  in due primarily to increased staffing and other development expenses related to acquisitions 
however  as a percentage of revenues  product development increased slightly from to these increases in expenses were partially offset by no bonus and profit sharing expense in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared with but remained relatively constant at of revenues 
expenses increased million from to  and also increased as a percentage of revenues 
approximately half of the expense increase in and resulted from acquisitions 
consulting costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and legal costs associated with a patent litigation were approximately  and  higher in than in these increases in expenses were partially offset by no bonus and profit sharing expense in  compared with million and approximately million in and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles increased as a result of the addition of million and million in amortizable intangible assets from acquisitions completed in and  respectively 
there is no goodwill amortization in and due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
as of january  goodwill amortization was  in we completed our initial impairment test of goodwill in the second quarter of  and our annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of and  and concluded in all cases that goodwill was not impaired 
in january  we initiated a restructuring of our eis product group in raleigh  north carolina  which resulted in a charge of approximately million related to workforce reductions 
the eis restructuring plan was substantially completed during in  we expensed million for planned costs related to the restructuring of our european operations 
the restructuring plan resulted in the closure of the vienne  france office  a reduction in workforce  the consolidation of product development efforts into existing company locations and the outsourcing of select production efforts in order to improve the overall profitability of our international operations 
continuation of this activity in resulted in an additional  of restructuring charges in from the write down of fixed assets and lease termination charges and international restructuring activities were substantially complete by mid we had a recovery of million in of previously expensed restructuring charges from a sublease of office space that was on more favorable terms than originally anticipated 
in process research and development during we recorded a  charge for ipr d related to the acquisition of silicon and in a million charge for ipr d related to the acquisition of linesoft as follows ipr d estimated cost to complete technology discount rate applied to ipr d weighted average cost of capital in millions silicon energy corp 
linesoft corporation at the time of the acquisitions  silicon and linesoft were in the process of developing new software products that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
we expect to benefit as products that contain the in process technology are marketed and sold to end users 
other income expense the following table shows the components of other income expense 
year ended december  in thousands equity in affiliates interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense included in equity in affiliates is income related to our equity interest in servatron  inc servatron  a company that performs contract manufacturing and repair services for us  of   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we wrote off approximately  of an investment in an affiliate 
interest income decreased by million in  compared with  due to lower cash investments  as well as a reduction of  in interest income associated with an impairment of loans provided to home ecosystems  inc  dba lanthorn technologies  inc 
lanthorn 
interest expense in resulted primarily from interest expense and amortization of loan origination fees on the term loan and credit line entered into in march for the silicon acquisition 
interest expense in and resulted primarily from subordinated debt  which we converted to equity in april and may in addition  in  we had interest expense related to mortgage debt for our spokane facility 
the weighted average of outstanding borrowings was million in  compared with million in and million in other income expense  net  decreased in  compared with  primarily due to the impairment and write down of minority investments in two companies 
we recorded a million impairment of the million in loans we provided to lanthorn due to a consideration of the estimated fair market value of the company as indicated by lanthorn s last round of financing 
the loans may be converted at any time into common stock of lanthorn 
in addition  we wrote off our ownership interest in another minority investment of approximately  in  as we believe the company ceased operations during the fourth quarter of included in other income expense  net  was an  pretax gain from the sale of our raleigh  nc facility and a  pretax gain from the early payoff of the mortgage on our spokane facility 
income taxes in our effective income tax rate was approximately compared with and in and  respectively 
the and rates include no tax benefit recognized for the  and million ipr d expenses since ipr d charges are not tax deductible 
excluding the impact of non tax deductible ipr d charges in and  the adjusted effective tax rates were and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period due to fluctuations in operating results  changes in the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets which reduce the tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized  new or revised tax legislation and changes in the level of business performed in domestic and international tax jurisdictions 
financial condition year ended december  in millions cash flow information operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash operating activities we generated million of cash from operations for the year ended december   compared with million in operating cash flow in was negatively impacted by a million cash payment to settle a patent infringement litigation  million of which was accrued in in addition  a million payment in may to duquesne light company related to an amendment to our long term warranty and maintenance agreement  was paid against an accrued loss for that contract and reduced operating cash flow 
we used million in cash in for bonus and profit sharing compared with generating million in cash in the change primarily resulting from no accrual in for bonus and profit sharing 
also contributing to lower operating cash flows were payments in for restructuring accruals in and higher accounts receivable balances at the end of compared with due to the timing of sales late in december and customers taking slightly longer to pay in days sales outstanding dso totaled days in compared with dso of days in we generated million in cash from operations in compared with million in improved operating cash flow in resulted primarily from higher bonus and profit sharing accruals in compared with and slightly faster turnover of accounts receivable 
dso totaled days in compared with dso of days in investing activities we used million in cash for the silicon acquisition during compared with million used for three acquisitions during there were no acquisitions in we used million for sem pre acquisition costs during  with no comparable activity in and we loaned  to lanthorn during  compared with million in we used million in cash for property  plant and equipment purchases during  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
we liquidated short term investments in  primarily to fund acquisitions 
net proceeds from short term investments were million in  compared with net purchases of million in during  proceeds of million on the sale of property  plant and equipment and the reclassification of million from restricted cash for a collateralized letter of credit to cash as a result of a new credit facility also contributed to cash inflows 
in connection with the purchase of linesoft in march  we replaced a pre existing non recourse loan in the amount of million to the former chief executive officer of linesoft with a new non recourse promissory note  secured with our common stock  in the same amount 
at december   the loan balance was approximately  and bore interest at an annual rate of 
the replacement note matured on may  and to settle the note  the remaining shares that secured the note were transferred to us 
the fair value of the shares was less than the outstanding balance on the note resulting in an expense of approximately  during to write off the residual value of the note 
financing activities in connection with the silicon acquisition in march  we received million in proceeds from a term loan under a new credit facility and paid debt origination fees of million 
repayments on the term loan were million in we had million outstanding on our revolving line of credit at december  compared with no borrowings outstanding at the end of and we received million from employee stock purchase plan purchases and stock option exercises during  compared with million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
cash used during  included million for the early repayment of mortgage debt  million to repay credit lines and long term debt assumed in the linesoft acquisition and million to repurchase  shares of common stock 
cash used during  included million to repurchase  shares of common stock 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 
contractual obligations total less than year years years beyond years in thousands term loan debt project financing debt revolving credit line operating and capital lease obligations guaranteed lease payments for an affiliate purchase and service commitments other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles total borrowings are disclosed within footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the revolving credit line was fully paid in january operating and capital lease obligations are disclosed in footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
guaranteed lease payments for an affiliate are disclosed in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we enter into standard purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that typically obligate us to purchase the items ordered 
purchase orders can vary in terms by providing an extended shipment period of up to one year at an established unit cost 
we had total outstanding purchase orders of million at december  long term executory purchase agreements that contain termination clauses have been classified within less than year as the commitment is the estimated amount we would be required to pay at december  if the commitment was canceled 
we had outstanding long term executory purchase agreements of million at december  we have no off balance sheet financing agreements 
investments as of december   we had loaned a total of million to lanthorn  which is developing internet based energy monitoring and management software and services 
the loans are convertible notes  which are due in march the notes accrue interest at and may be converted at any time into common stock of lanthorn 
if we had converted our notes into equity at december   they would have converted into approximately of lanthorn s common stock assuming that all granted stock options and other convertible debt of the firm were exercised or converted 
lanthorn has not yet produced any significant revenue 
in december  we recorded a million impairment charge related to lanthorn  which consisted of a  reversal of interest income recognized in the first three quarters of and a million charge to other income expense  net  for principal 
during we wrote off a minority investment  resulting in a  charge to other income expense  net 
liquidity  sources and uses of capital we have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations  borrowings and sales of our stock 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents and short term investments historically have been invested in investments rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and have market interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments 
at december   we had a million secured credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million three year term loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at december   and a million revolving credit line 
at december   there were million of borrowings and approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit line 
collateral that has been granted to the lenders includes equipment  inventory  real property and intellectual property 
the credit facility contains financial covenants which require us to maintain certain liquidity and coverage ratios on a quarterly basis 
at december   our fixed charge coverage ratio was below the minimum required according to a covenant in our loan agreement 
in early february  we received a waiver of compliance with the covenant from our lenders 
in connection with our acquisition of sem  we intend to replace our current credit facility with million of new debt for a net increase in our debt facilities of approximately million 
on december   on a documentary or paper basis we closed a new million senior secured credit facility comprised of a replacement million revolving credit line and a million seven year term loan 
the new facility does not permit borrowing until certain conditions are satisfied  including closing the acquisition of sem 
without the satisfaction of the remaining conditions the new credit facility expires the later of march   or the deadline date of the sem acquisition agreement  but no later than may  the annual interest rates under the new facility will vary depending on market rates  with initial interest rates of libor plus for the revolving line of credit and libor plus for the term loan 
if we are unable to complete the final or financial closing of the new credit facility by march   or thereafter  in respect of our existing credit facility  we anticipate we will be below the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio covenant referred to above for the first three quarters of and a leverage ratio covenant for the quarter ended march   due in part to a four quarter rolling calculation of a component of our covenant requirements 
consequently  the million long term portion of our term loan has been classified as a current liability at december  we believe we will be able to obtain a waiver of covenant compliance for the first three quarters of  and therefore  existing cash resources and available borrowings are adequate to meet our cash needs through we maintain bid and performance bonds for certain customers 
bonds in force were million and million at december  and  respectively 
bid bonds guarantee that we will enter into a contract consistent with the terms of the bid 
performance bonds provide a guarantee to the customer for future performance  which usually covers the installation phase of a contract and may on occasion cover the operations and maintenance phase of outsourcing contracts 
during  we received a cancellation notice from a bonding company on a million performance bond  based on policy changes at the bonding company  which cancellation became effective in february we have negotiated a reduction in performance collateral  in the form of a bond  a letter of credit and or escrowed cash totaling million to million  depending on the form 
in january  we replaced the bond with an million letter of credit 
we also have standby letters of credit to guarantee our performance under certain contracts 
the outstanding amounts of standby letters of credit were million at december  and in march  we issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of approximately million to a third party landlord to guarantee a subsidiary s lease payments on a facility 
the standby letter of credit renews on an annual basis during the term of the lease  which expires in if we fail to make a scheduled lease payment  the landlord could draw up to the maximum amount specified on the standby letter of credit 
in may  we reduced a standby letter of credit from million to million as a result of an amendment to a long term warranty and maintenance agreement with a customer 
we guarantee lease payments for certain equipment leased by an affiliated company 
the maximum future lease obligation of the guarantee at december  was approximately  the lease and our guarantee terminate in in the event the affiliate is unable to pay a monthly lease obligation  we would be required to make the payment 
if we do not make the payment  the equipment would be returned to the lessor 
in the event that the equipment is not in working condition  we would be obligated to pay for the equipment to be returned to working condition 
we generally provide an indemnification related to the infringement of any patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property right on software or equipment within our sales contracts  which indemnifies the customer from and pays the resulting costs  damages and attorney fees awarded against a customer with respect to such a claim provided that a the customer promptly notifies us in writing of the claim and b we have the sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations 
the terms of the indemnification normally do not limit the maximum potential future payments 
we also provide an indemnification for third party claims resulting from damages caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of our employees agents in connection with the performance of certain contracts 
the terms of the indemnification generally do not limit the maximum potential payments 
on october   we settled all issues in a patent infringement litigation for million 
the settlement included payment for all royalties  attorneys fees and other items  including the assigned ownership of the patent to us 
we accrued million in and expensed  in related to this matter 
we are a party to various other lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business  none of which  in our opinion  are expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
none of the various other lawsuits or claims required the recognition of a liability as of december   as negative outcomes are not considered probable 
in march  we acquired linesoft  a leading provider of engineering design software applications and consulting services for optimizing the construction or rebuilding of utility t d infrastructure 
we are required to pay additional amounts to certain linesoft shareholders of up to million in the event that certain defined revenue targets in and or are exceeded 
any earnout payments will be paid half in cash and half in our common stock 
if an earnout is required  the purchase price will be increased by the fair value of the payment 
the revenue target was not exceeded and an earnout was not recorded 
we do not expect the revenue target to be exceeded and therefore  it is unlikely an earnout payment will be required in in october  we acquired regional economic research  inc rer  a california based company specializing in energy consulting  analysis and forecasting services and software 
we are required to pay additional amounts to certain rer shareholders of up to million to the extent that certain defined revenue targets in and are exceeded 
rer exceeded the defined revenue target established for and we accrued a liability of million for the expected earnout payment 
the purchase price was increased by the earnout and recorded as an addition to goodwill 
we expect that the revenue target will be exceeded and that an additional earnout in the range of to million will be required in the form of the anticipated earnout is payable in cash and or our common stock based solely upon our discretion 
the earnout will be paid in cash on or before march  in  total net deferred tax assets increased approximately million primarily due to net deferred tax assets of approximately million recorded as part of the acquisition of silicon during march silicon s net deferred tax assets primarily represent net operating loss carryforwards that will be limited in use on an annual basis pursuant to internal revenue code section section 
the net value assigned to the silicon related deferred tax assets is based on preliminary estimates and is subject to adjustment 
our net deferred tax assets also consist of our own accumulated net operating losses and section limited deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of linesoft and rer 
we expect to utilize tax loss carryforwards and available tax credits to offset taxes otherwise due on regular taxable income in upcoming years 
during  we expect to pay approximately million in cash for federal alternative minimum tax and various state tax obligations 
we expect to begin making significant cash payments for federal tax purposes beginning in as tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards not limited by section will have been fully utilized in working capital at december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the classification of million of the long term portion of our term loan as a current liability at december   and the use of million in cash for the acquisition of silicon in march if we are unable to complete the final or financial closing of our new credit facility by march   or thereafter  in respect of our existing credit facility  we anticipate we will be below the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio covenant on our current loan for the first three quarters of and a debt leverage ratio covenant for the quarter ended march   due in part to a four quarter rolling calculation of a component of our covenant requirements 
consequently  the million long term portion of our term loan has been classified as a current liability  resulting in million classified as short term debt at december  the dso for billed and unbilled accounts receivable totaled days in compared with dso of days in historically  our dso ratio has been driven more by specific contract billing terms rather than collection issues 
in november  we began a facility expansion in waseca  which will allow for capacity expansion beyond our current six million units 
the cost of the expansion is not expected to exceed million 
we expect to continue to expand our operations and grow our business through a combination of internal new product development  licensing technology from or to others  distribution agreements  partnership arrangements and acquisitions of technology or other companies 
we expect these activities to be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations  borrowings and the issuance of common stock or other securities 
we believe existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our existing operations and obligations for the foreseeable future  but offer no assurances 
our liquidity requirements could be affected by our dependence on the stability of the energy industry  competitive pressures  international risks  intellectual property claims and other factors described under certain risks relating to our business within item and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a  included in our form k 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are recognized when products are shipped to or received by a customer or when services are provided 
we have certain customer arrangements with multiple elements 
for such arrangements  we determine the fair value of each element and then allocate the total arrangement consideration among the separate elements under the provisions of eitf revenues for each element are then recognized based on the type of element  such as when the products are shipped  services are delivered  percentage of completion when implementation services are essential to the software performance or upon customer acceptance provisions 
under outsourcing arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are provided 
hardware and software post contract customer support fees are recognized over the life of the related service contracts 
revenue can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of orders and the application of revenue recognition criteria 
use of the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition requires estimating the cost to complete a project 
actual costs may vary from estimates 
unearned revenue is recorded for products or services when the criteria for revenue recognition has not been met 
the majority of unearned revenue relates to annual billing terms for post sale maintenance and support agreements 
accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our historical experience of bad debts and is adjusted for estimated uncollectible amounts 
inventories inventories consist primarily of sub assemblies and components necessary to support maintenance contracts 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials  labor and other applied direct and indirect costs 
if the market value of the inventory falls below the original cost  the inventory value is reduced to the market value 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
inventory is subject to rapidly changing technologies 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are primarily the result of our acquisitions in and we use estimates in determining the value of goodwill and intangible assets  including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets  discounted future cash flows and fair values of the related operations 
we test annually  on october st  to determine whether goodwill has been impaired  under the guidance of sfas no 
we utilize an independent appraiser to forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level  which consists of our business units  based on our historical and best estimates of future revenues and operating costs  which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog  expected future orders  supplier contracts and general market conditions 
changes in our forecasts or cost of capital may result in asset value write downs  which could have a significant impact on our current and future financial position and results of operations 
warranty we offer standard warranty terms on most of our product sales of between one and three years 
the warranty accrual includes the cost to manufacture or purchase warranty parts from our suppliers as well as the cost to install or repair equipment 
the warranty accrual is based on historical product performance trends  business volume assumptions  supplier information and other business and economic projections 
thorough testing of new products in the development stage helps to identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing 
continuing quality control efforts during manufacturing limit our exposure to warranty claims 
we track warranty claims in order to identify any potential warranty trends 
if our quality control efforts were to fail to detect a fault in one of our products  we could experience an increase in warranty claims resulting in an increase in the warranty accrual 
management continually evaluates the sufficiency of warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
actual warranty costs may fluctuate and may be different than amounts accrued 
for example  in  we made net adjustments to previous warranty estimates totaling million 
contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the provisions are to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
we do not have any financial instruments to which this statement would apply 
in may  the fasb ratified the consensus on emerging issues task force eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  which provides guidance on when an arrangement represents a lease transaction and requires the application of sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the guidance is effective for arrangements entered into or modified after june  the provisions of this guidance may impact our accounting for future outsourcing contracts 
we have not entered into or modified any arrangements subsequent to june  to which this guidance may apply 
subsequent event as discussed in our press releases dated january  and february   we do not expect to see growth in our electric business unit in the first quarter of due to order delays by several large electric customers 
we do expect to see order activity increase in the second quarter of in january we began to implement a change in our organizational structure as we moved from profit and loss responsibility and reporting along business unit or market lines to two primary operations groups hardware and software 
in the process of developing the new structure  and in light of lower expectations for first quarter revenues  we took some corrective actions to reduce expenses and eliminate certain unprofitable activities 
those actions resulted in a reduction of approximately employees  or  of our workforce and will result in a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of the segment information presented in this form k is based on the organizational structure in place from through we expect to begin reporting under the new organization structure beginning with our second quarter results in at that time  historical amounts will be restated 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of approximately million and variable rate debt of million 
weighted average variable rates in the table are based on implied forward rates in the libor yield curve as of february  and our estimated ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
the table below illustrates the scheduled repayment of principal over the remaining lives of the debt at december  beyond in millions fixed rate debt project financing debt average interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit line average interest rate term loan debt average interest rate if we are unable to complete the final or financial closing of the new credit facility by march   or thereafter  in respect of our existing credit facility  we anticipate we will be below the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for the first three quarters of and a debt leverage ratio covenant for the quarter ended march   due in part to a four quarter rolling calculation of a component of our covenant requirements 
consequently  the million long term portion of our term loan has been classified as a current liability at december  our variable rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates 
our requirement to enter into an interest rate hedge agreement to substantially fix or limit the interest rate on at least of our the term loan principal for a minimum of two years was waived to march  the forecasted interest rates provided in the tabular format above do not include the benefits of the interest rate hedge agreement  which will be entered into subsequent to the date of this document 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   we estimate that if market interest rates average higher than in the table above in  our earnings before income taxes in would decrease by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in a number of foreign countries and  therefore  face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
international revenue was of our total revenue in since we do not use derivative instruments to manage all foreign currency exchange rate risks  the consolidated results of operations in us dollars are subject to fluctuation as foreign exchange rates change 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange rate exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to non us dollar denominated sales  cost of sales and operating expenses in our international subsidiary operations 
this means we are subject to changes in the consolidated results of operations expressed in us dollars 
other international business  consisting primarily of shipments from the us to international distributors and customers in the pacific rim and latin america  is predominantly denominated in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in some cases where sales from the us are not denominated in us dollars  we have and may hedge our foreign exchange risk by selling the expected foreign currency receipts forward 
there have been and there may continue to be large period to period fluctuations in the relative portions of international revenue that are denominated in foreign currencies 
risk sensitive financial instruments in the form of inter company trade receivables are mostly denominated in us dollars  while inter company notes may be denominated in local foreign currencies 
as foreign currency exchange rates change  inter company trade receivables impact current earnings  while inter company notes may be re valued and result in unrealized translation gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income 
because our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated 
at december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or on the fair value of any risk sensitive financial instruments 
the model assumes foreign currency exchange rates will shift in the same direction and relative amount 
however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may result in the overstatement or understatement of the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
consequently  the actual effects on operations in the future may differ materially from results of the analysis for the year ended december  we may  in the future  experience greater fluctuations in us dollar earnings from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of currency fluctuations and may institute hedging alternatives
