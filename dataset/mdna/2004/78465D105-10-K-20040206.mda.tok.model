our remaining customer base revenues increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
this increase in growth is directly related to our hiring of more account executives which enabled us to penetrate deeper into our existing customer base and focus on developing other vertical markets 
we successfully continued to diversify our customer base by adding fifteen new customers in these additions reduced our overall percentage of customers in the aerospace and defense industry 
we continue to exercise our growth model through the hiring of additional account executives 
revenue for increased million or to million compared to million for the increase in revenues during this period was primarily attributable to an increase in program support services revenues of which a majority of the growth was derived from our work on the lockheed martin joint strike fighter program 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin is directly related to the increase in our revenues 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin as a percentage of revenue increase is attributable to four factors 
first  we saw an increase in revenues coming from proposal services compared to program support services 
revenue coming from proposal services was of revenues as compared to in our proposal services revenue carries a moderately higher gross margin 
second  we moderately increased our billing rates in june  which affected new contracts entered into after june third  we reduced our travel expenses related to our service offerings  lastly  we received approximately  in win incentives in compared to approximately  in we offer some of our clients a win incentive discount which is defined as a discounted bill rate that we can recoup if our client wins their proposal or subsequently chooses not to bid after the proposal development process has begun

in march  the internal revenue service completed their examination related to years to based on the conclusion of the examination  we reduced our tax contingency reserve that resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of million or per diluted share for the twelve months ended december  the improvement in our tax rate in is related to the job creation and workers assistance act of  the act which was enacted in february the act allowed us to benefit from certain net operating losses that we otherwise would not have been able to benefit 
in this regard  in october  we entered into negotiations to  among other things  amend selected sections of the stock purchase and sale agreement with l communications corporation related to the disposition of emergent east 
the resulting amendment to that agreement allowed us to realize an immediate additional net tax benefit under the act of  discontinued operations on november   we completed the sale of our interest in the common stock of emergent east also known as the government services group or gsg  a provider of system engineering  scientific research  program management and technical support services 
the sale was to l communications corporation for million in cash 
accordingly  the operating results of emergent east  including provisions for losses during the period from october  through the closing date  facility lease costs and other costs to be incurred in connection with the sale  have been accrued

in addition  we recorded a income tax adjustment which reduced our income tax expense by approximately million

cash receipts related to our employees participation in both our stock option and employee stock purchase plan was million and  for the years ended and  respectively 
no dividends were paid in in april  we renewed our previous revolving credit agreement 
the renewed agreement allows for borrowings up to million at the prime rate minus one half of one percent per annum or libor plus two and one quarter percent per annum 
the new revolving credit agreement expires in april and we plan to renew the agreement or seek a replacement agreement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are unsecured 
the agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants pertaining to our tangible net worth  ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  and ratio of current assets to current liabilities as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also contains certain negative covenants which  among other things  restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness of more than million in excess of the million limit set forth in the credit agreement and make capital expenditures in excess of million without the prior written approval of the lender 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with million in availability 
our contractual obligations are as follows at december  contractual obligations payments due by period year after in thousands total or less years years years operating leases operating leases related to discontinued operations  net of subleases total operating leases related to discontinued operations represent office space previously occupied by the emergent east and emergent central divisions 
the amounts above represent the remaining lease commitments over the remaining terms of the leases 
we have entered into subleases for two of our leased properties 
these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitments for these properties  and we expect these subleases to continue in effect for the life of our lease obligations with respect to these properties 
we are continuing the process of identifying sub lessees for our remaining leased property or negotiating lease buy outs with the lessors 
we believe we have sufficient working capital available under the line of credit that expires in april  and cash generated by continuing operations will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
we believe we will be able to extend or replace the line of credit when it expires 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our services are provided under time and expenses billing arrangements  and revenue is recognized on the basis of hours worked  plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue is directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
a limited amount of revenue is also derived from success fees  offered to clients as a pricing option  and recorded as revenue only upon attainment of the specified incentive criteria 
success fees are not billable and revenue is not recorded until the client wins a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of potential future uncollectible accounts receivable related to current period revenue 
management exercises its best business judgment and reasonable assumptions and estimates in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period dependent upon the best business judgment and reasonable estimates invoked by management in calculating these rent estimates 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  recently issued financial accounting standards in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
we adopted statement no 
in the first quarter of  and its adoption did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
this pronouncement requires the consolidation of variable interest entities created after january  consolidation provisions apply for periods ending after march  for variable interest entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february  we do not have any variable interest entities  including special purpose entities  that must be consolidated and therefore the adoption of the provision of fin will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations
