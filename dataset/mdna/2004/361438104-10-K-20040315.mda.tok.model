item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item to this report 
introduction our principal business is providing investment advisory and brokerage services to mutual fund  institutional and high net worth investors  primarily in the united states 
we generally manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of us and international securities through various investment styles 
our revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management  which are directly influenced by the value of the overall equity markets 
assets under management can also increase through acquisitions and by the addition of new accounts 
since various equity products have different fees  changes in our business mix may also affect revenues 
at times  the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices  and this can also impact our revenues 
it is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of assets under management and hence  revenues 
this becomes increasingly likely as the base of assets grows 
for the year period ended december   stocks provided an average total return of about  according to ibbotson associates 
management believes the market will continue to exhibit volatility in line with historical experience and believes the return registered by the s p index in must be taken in the context of a market that declined in the prior years 
for planning purposes  we are estimating stock market gains of to for the next to year period  driven by a similar magnitude of growth in corporate profits 
we expect that an increase in tax rates or inflation rates would reduce stock market returns 
similarly  increased regulation of the mutual fund industry  combined with growing fee pressures and our willingness to participate in certain ntf programs  may impair our profit margins 
as discussed in the regulation section in item of this report  the mutual fund reform act of the mutual fund act if enacted would impact rule b distribution fees  prohibit soft dollar arrangements and restrict the management of hedge funds and mutual funds by the same portfolio manager 
the effects of the mutual fund act and potentially other regulatory actions pose a risk to our future revenues and operating margins 
while we are unable to quantity the effects at this time  the impact may be material to our business 
overview investment advisory and incentive fees  which are based on the amount and composition of assets under management in our mutual funds  separate accounts and alternative investments  represent our largest source of revenues 
in addition to the general level and trends of the stock market  growth in revenues depends on good investment performance  which influences the value of existing assets under management as well as contributing to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitating the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels 
growth in assets under management is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels  which is usually based on several factors  including performance and service 
historically  we have depended primarily on direct distribution of our products and services  but since have participated in third party distribution programs  including ntf programs 
a majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through these channels since attempts by some ntf program sponsors to increase their service or distribution fees may result in several of our mutual funds being withdrawn from such programs 
the effects of this on our future financial results cannot be determined at this time  but could be material 
in recent years  we have been engaged to act as a sub adviser for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations 
a substantial portion of the cash flows into our institutional and separate accounts business has come through this channel 
these sub advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship 
the loss of a sub advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future 
advisory fees from the mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter  and alternative investment fees are computed either monthly or quarterly 
these revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions  financial market conditions and the fee structure for assets under management 
revenues derived from the equity oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
revenues from our alternative investments also generally include an incentive allocation or fee of of the economic profit  as defined 
the incentive allocation and fees are recorded as earned with the related compensation expense accrued 
the incentive allocation and fees and related compensation expense may increase or decrease during the year depending upon the performance of the underlying alternative investment products 
we also receive fulcrum fees from certain separate accounts based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
these fees are finalized and received when the contract period is completed 
certain fees in our closed end funds are only earned if the fund s total return is greater than a specified total return 
a total of million of assets in closed end funds are subject to such arrangements 
commission revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of mutual funds  institutional and high net worth clients as well as investment banking revenue  which consists of underwriting profits  selling concessions and management fees associated with underwriting activities 
commission revenues vary directly with account trading activity and new account generation 
investment banking revenues are directly impacted by the overall market conditions  which affect the number of public offerings which may take place 
distribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue in accordance with rule b b of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues 
distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of assets under management and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by gabelli company and through various distribution channels 
as discussed in the regulation section in item of this report  the effects of the mutual fund reform act of if enacted and other congressional and sec actions pose a risk to gabelli company s future distribution fee revenue as b fees may be repealed or restricted 
compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers  portfolio managers  sales  trading  research and all other professional staff 
other operating expenses include marketing  product distribution and promotion costs  clearing charges and fees for gabelli company s brokerage operation  and other general and administrative operating costs 
other income and expenses include net gain from investments which includes both realized and unrealized gains  interest and dividend income  and interest expense 
net gain from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments 
minority interest represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders  as reported on a separate company basis  of our consolidated majority owned subsidiaries

total net outflows from fixed income products were  in for the three years ended december   and our net cash inflows and outflows by product line were as follows in millions mutual funds equities  fixed income total mutual funds   institutional hnw separate accounts equities  fixed income total institutional hnw separate accounts  alternative investments equities fixed income total alternative investments total equities   total fixed income total net cash in out flows   operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million in  million or below total revenues of million in the decline in total revenues by revenue component was as follows in millions increase decrease investment advisory and incentive fees commissions distribution fees and other income total revenues investment advisory and incentive fees investment advisory and incentive fees  which comprised of total revenues in  are directly influenced by the level and mix of assets under management 
assets under management ended the year at a record billion  a increase over prior year end assets under management of billion 
despite reaching a record level of assets on december   investment advisory fees in declined slightly from as average assets under management in declined to billion from billion in as we look forward to  investment advisory fees will benefit from a full twelve months of revenue from gdv 
the initial public offering of gdv generated gross proceeds of approximately billion in november and added an additional million of gross proceeds through the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in january mutual fund revenues increased million or  as lower revenues from open end equity mutual funds were more than offset by higher revenues from closed end funds 
revenue from open end equity funds decreased million or from the prior year as average assets under management in declined to billion from billion in the increase in assets during the last half of resulting from strong performance results did not offset the effect on revenues of lower asset levels during the first six months 
closed end fund revenues increased million or from the prior year as fees from assets subject to performance fee arrangements where the fees are earned based upon the respective fund meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment thresholds over a stipulated period of time contributed to the majority of this increase 
closed end fund assets and revenue also benefited from the launch of gdv during the fourth quarter of gdv began trading on the new york stock exchange on november  and commenced investment operations on november  revenue from our institutional and high net worth separate accounts decreased million or as lower average asset levels and a lower average advisory fee rate due to the effect of a shift in account mix were the principal reasons for the decline 
while revenue declined  assets in our equity separate accounts rose billion or for the year of which billion or of this increase occurred in the th quarter of  principally through market appreciation 
as our separate account revenues are largely based on values at the beginning of a quarter  the impact of the fourth quarter increase will be more fully realized in the strong historical performance of our separate accounts coupled with renewed interest from investors seeking to rebalance their portfolios and reallocate from fixed income to tax sensitive  separately managed equity accounts should provide additional benefits in total advisory fees from alternative investments increased to million in from million in higher overall assets under management led to an increase in management fees of to million from million in incentive allocations and fees from alternative investment products  which generally represent of the economic profit  increased to million in compared to million in commissions commission revenues in were million  million or lower than commission revenues of million in lower commission revenues from a decline in agency trading activity for accounts managed by affiliated companies and the implementation of a simplified commission structure were partially offset by higher commission revenues from institutional and retail customers 
commission revenues derived from transactions on behalf of our mutual funds and separate account clients totaled million  or approximately of total commission revenues in distribution fees and other income distribution fees and other income declined or million to million in from million in the year to year decline was principally the result of lower average assets under management in open end equity mutual funds with distribution plans and the waiver of the b distribution fee on the abc fund which began in january expenses total expenses were million in  an increase of million or from total expenses of million in operating margin declined to in from in as operating income declined million year over year 
compensation compensation costs  which are largely variable in nature and increase or decrease as revenues grow or decline  increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in the majority of this increase was attributable to higher variable compensation related to our alternative investments an increase of million and compensation not directly tied to revenues which included stock option expense an increase of million  higher costs related to research  sales and investment professionals an increase of million and the year over year effect of a reversal of incentive compensation in million 
while the increase in staffing has impacted operating margins in the short term  we have strengthened our asset gathering capabilities and broadened our research and investment expertise which is expected to increase asset and revenue growth and improve operating margins over the longer term 
in  we also expect to add professional staff to assist in the execution of our business strategy 
management fee management fee expense  a totally variable cost based on pre tax profits  declined to million in versus million in other operating expenses other operating expenses  which include marketing  promotion and distribution costs as well as general operating expenses increased million or to million in a large portion of this increase related to higher general operating expenses including accounting  legal and insurance costs which were partly related to complying to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs are expected to continue to have an impact in as well as in subsequent years 
other income and expense our proprietary investment portfolio consists of investments in mutual funds  us treasury bills  common stocks as well as private investments 
net gain from investments  which is derived from our proprietary investment portfolio  was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million in in a gain of million was realized from the repurchase of  shares of our mandatory convertible securities 
interest and dividend income was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income was principally the result of a decrease in short term interest rates 
dividend income included a  dividend received in the third quarter of from our westwood holdings group  inc whg investment 
interest expense rose million to million in  from million in the increase in interest expense was attributable to the issuance of million senior notes in may offset partially from the decrease of on the convertible note from to in august the note is convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our class a common stock at per share 
the mandatory convertible securities consist of both a purchase contract to purchase shares of our class a common stock on february  and senior notes due february  the purchase contract includes a contract adjustment payment of per year and the notes bear interest at per year  which rate is expected to be reset on november  the settlement of the purchase contract in february will result in the issuance of between million and million shares of our class a common stock which will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was down from the effective tax rate of traceable to the effect of a dividend received deduction related to the whg dividend 
minority interest minority interest expense was million in up from million in the increase in minority interest expense was largely the result of increased earnings from our alternative investment products and income from our investments at our owned subsidiary  gabelli securities  inc net income net income for was million or per diluted share versus million or per diluted share for the decline in net income of in can be attributed to the impact of weak equity markets during the first six months of the year on average assets under management  higher compensation costs and an increase in other operating expenses 
shares outstanding on a diluted basis at december  were million and included million shares from the assumed conversion of our convertible note for the full year as under the applicable accounting methodology used to compute dilution  the convertible note was dilutive 
the full number of shares which may be issued upon conversion of this note is approximately million 
shares issuable under the mandatory convertible securities are excluded from the diluted shares calculation under current accounting rules 
shares of our class a common stock issuable under the mandatory convertible securities pursuant to the settlement of the purchase contract in february will be between million and million and will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share 
during  we issued  shares from the exercise of stock options and repurchased  shares 
at december   we had  options outstanding to purchase our class a common stock which were granted under our stock award and incentive plans the plans 
management may recommend to the board of directors to commence a tender offer in to purchase the options granted in under the plans 
as of december   there were  options outstanding that would be eligible to participate in the tender offer 
if the tender offer is consummated  it will result in the acceleration of compensation and other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the tender offer is completed rather than over the remaining life of the options and will result in a decline in earnings in dividend we paid our first dividend of per share on december  to our class a shareholders of record on december  the holders of our class b common stock  gabelli group capital partners  inc and its two subsidiaries  agreed to waive receipt of this dividend or  operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues were million in  million or below total revenues of million in the decline in total revenues by revenue component was as follows in millions increase decrease investment advisory and incentive fees commissions distribution fees and other income total revenues investment advisory fees and incentive fees investment advisory fees are directly influenced by the level and mix of assets under management 
nearly of assets managed by gabelli are in equity products 
average assets managed  and therefore investment advisory fees  continued to be impacted by the overall decline in the world equity markets during equity markets were down for a third straight year as the s p  russell and nasdaq indices fell  and  respectively 
against this backdrop  assets managed in our open end equity mutual funds declined to billion in  from billion in substantially all of this billion decline was due to market performance as equity mutual fund cash outflows were less than billion in the decline in equity managed assets was largely offset by an increase in assets managed in our fixed income products 
the result of lower equity valuations and a shift in mix to lower margin fixed income products led to a decline in mutual fund revenues of  or million  to million in from million in investment advisory fees from our institutional and high net worth separate accounts rose million to million in compared to million in  benefiting from nearly million in net new cash flows into its equity portfolios during the year 
advisory fees from alternative investment products increased to million from million in due to higher overall levels of assets under management

short term investments are comprised primarily of united states treasury securities with maturities of less than one year and money market funds managed by gabelli 
although the alternative investments are for the most part illiquid  the underlying investments of such partnerships or funds are for the most part liquid and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity

we have established a collateral account  consisting of cash and cash equivalents totaling million  to secure a letter of credit issued in favor of the holder of the million convertible note 
the letter of credit was extended and expires on august   which coincides with the date of a put option the note holder may exercise 
cash and securities held in the collateral account are restricted from other uses until the letter of credit expires

we continue to maintain our investment grade rating which we have received from two ratings agencies  moody s investors services and standard and poor s ratings services

gabelli company is registered with the commission as a broker dealer and is a member of the nasd 
as such  it is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the commission 
gabelli company s net capital has historically exceeded these minimum requirements 
gabelli company computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the commission  which requires minimum net capital of  as of december  and  gabelli company had net capital  as defined  of approximately million and million  respectively  exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately million and million  respectively

we have consistently met or exceeded these minimum requirements 
market risk equity price risk we are subject to potential losses from certain market risks as a result of absolute and relative price movements in financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  equity prices and other factors 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as financial intermediary and adviser for assets under management in our mutual funds  separate accounts  and alternative investments as well as our proprietary investment and trading activities 
at december   our primary market risk exposure was for changes in equity prices and interest rates 
at december  and  we had equity investments  including mutual funds largely invested in equity products  of million and million  respectively 
investments in mutual funds  million and million at december  and  respectively  generally lower market risk through the diversification of financial instruments within their portfolios 
in addition  we may alter our investment holdings from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors considered appropriate by management 
we also hold investments in partnerships and affiliates which invest primarily in equity securities and which are subject to changes in equity prices 
investments in partnerships and affiliates totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  of which million and million were invested in partnerships and affiliates which invest in event driven merger arbitrage strategies 
these strategies are primarily dependent upon deal closure rather than the overall market environment 
the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for our investments in equity securities and partnerships and affiliates which invest primarily in equity securities excluding arbitrage products  for which the principal exposure is to deal closure and not overall market conditions  as of december  and the sensitivity analysis assumes a increase or decrease in the value of these investments 
in thousands fair value assuming fair value assuming decrease in increase in fair value equity prices equity prices at december  equity price sensitive investments  at fair value    at december  equity price sensitive investments  at fair value    our revenues are largely driven by the market value of our assets under management and are therefore exposed to fluctuations in market prices of these assets  which are largely readily marketable equity securities 
investment advisory fees for mutual funds are based on average daily or weekly asset values 
advisory fees earned on institutional and separate accounts  for any given quarter  are determined based on asset values at the beginning of a quarter 
any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur during a quarter will result in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter 
alternative investment advisory fees are computed based on monthly or quarterly asset values 
the incentive allocation or fee of of the economic profit from alternative investments is impacted by changes in the market prices of the underlying investments of these products 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk results  principally  from our investment of excess cash in government obligations 
these investments are primarily short term in nature and the fair value of these investments generally approximates market value 
our mandatory convertible securities include a provision to reset the interest rate in november the reset rate will be determined by the rates the notes should bear in order for each note to have an aggregate market value of of the principal amount of the note 
if the reset rate were determined at december  the interest rate would have been approximately commitments and contingencies we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and capital and operating lease agreements 
the following table sets forth our significant contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations senior notes   convertible note   mandatory convertible securities   capital lease obligations   non cancelable operating lease obligations  total       in addition  the convertible note provides the holder certain put rights  at par plus accrued interest  on august  if exercised  we will be required to pay down the entire principal balance at that time 
a collateral account consisting of cash and securities has been established in the amount of million to secure a letter of credit in favor of the convertible note holder 
the letter of credit will expire on august  off balance sheet arrangements we are the general partner or co general partner of various limited partnerships whose underlying assets consist primarily of marketable securities 
as general partner or co general partner  we are contingently liable for all of the limited partnerships liabilities 
our income from these limited partnerships consists of our share of the management fee and the incentive allocation from the limited partners 
we also receive our pro rata return on any investment made in the limited partnership 
we earned management fees of million in and million in and incentive fees of million and million in and  respectively 
our pro rata loss on investments in these limited partnerships totaled million in as compared to a gain of million in we do not invest in any other off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience  when available  and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition  the valuation of investments  goodwill and other long lived intangibles  income taxes  stock option accounting and the possible impact of financial interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
revenue recognition advisory fees from the mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the beginning of a quarter  and alternative investment fees are computed either monthly or quarterly 
revenues from our alternative investment products also generally include an incentive allocation or fee of of the economic profit  as defined  which is recorded as earned 
the incentive allocation and fees may increase or decrease during the year as the profits of the product increase or decrease 
revenues may also include performance fees and fulcrum fees from certain separate accounts and closed end funds based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
performance and fulcrum fees are finalized and received when the contract period is completed 
investments we hold investments in investment partnerships and affiliates  whose underlying assets consist mainly of marketable securities  which are accounted for using the equity method  under which we record our share of the earnings or losses into income as earned 
while many of these underlying investments are publicly traded and have readily available market valuations  some of their investments are non publicly traded whose value may be difficult to determine 
investments are written down when management believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and thereby require an impairment charge to earnings 
goodwill and other long lived intangible assets prior to the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other long lived intangible assets were amortized each year 
the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of  eliminated the amortization of these assets and established requirements for having them tested for impairment at least annually 
at december  management assessed the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  it may result in an impairment charge for these assets to income 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we prepare a number of tax returns  which are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the inherent complications in the various tax codes often create the need for subjective judgments in applying its provisions 
while management believes that tax positions taken comply with tax law and are both reasonable and supported by the facts and circumstances of the situation  upon audit additional taxes may be assessed 
while assessments may be proposed in the future  both the extent of and potential impact on financial results cannot be determined at this time 
stock based compensation effective january   we use a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation provided to our employees in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results  including the estimated life of the option  the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
there may be other factors  which have not been considered  which may have an effect on the value of the options as well 
the effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the black scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation for the options and a resulting difference in our net income 
recent accounting developments in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinded sfas no 
reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result of the rescission  the criteria in apb opinion no 
is used to classify gains and losses from debt extinguishments 
since the issuance of sfas no 
 the use of debt extinguishments has become a part of the risk management strategy of many companies  particularly those who participate in the secondary lending markets 
debt extinguishment no longer meets the criteria for classification as extraordinary items in apb opinion no 
accordingly  gains from the repurchase of our mandatory convertible securities in and of  and  respectively  have been included in net gain from investments and not as an extraordinary item 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in and and is not expected to have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin  which provides accounting  and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we indemnify our clearing brokers for losses they may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by our broker dealer subsidiaries 
in accordance with new york stock exchange rules customer balances are typically collateralized by customer securities or supported by other recourse provisions 
in addition  we further limit margin balances to a maximum of versus permitted under exchange regulations 
at december  the total amount of customer balances subject to indemnification ie margin debits was immaterial 
the company also has entered into arrangements with various other third parties which provide for indemnification against losses  costs  claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their obligations under our agreement  except for gross negligence or bad faith 
the company has had no claims or payments pursuant to these or prior agreements  and we believe the likelihood of a claim being made is remote 
utilizing the methodology in fin  our estimate of the value of such agreements is de minimis  and therefore an accrual has not been made in the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which provides alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and also amends its disclosure provisions 
in addition to the prospective method originally provided under sfas no 
 sfas no 
provides for a modified prospective and a retroactive restatement method 
sfas no 
further expands the disclosure requirements to require disclosure in condensed consolidated interim financial statements for any period in which stock based awards are outstanding and accounted for using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
effective january   we began expensing options on a modified prospective method using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued intepretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities vie and generally would require that the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it 
the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity ie  variable interests 
an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights  absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
once an entity is determined to be a vie  its assets  liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity which either will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss  fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
on december   the fasb issued a revision to fin to clarify some of the provisions of this interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
application by public entities  other than small business issuers  for all other types of variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  while gabelli is generally not subject to a majority of the risks of the vies  we may be determined  for certain entities  to receive a majority of the expected residual returns based on the methodology for determining the primary beneficiary 
therefore  when implemented  the interpretation may require consolidation of certain of our investment in partnerships and affiliates assets and liabilities and results of operations with minority interest recorded for the ownership share applicable to other investors 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method will impact detailed line items reported within the consolidated financial statements but not overall consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
where consolidation is not required additional disclosures may be required 
we anticipate consolidating investments in partnerships and affiliates  which are deemed to be vies and for which we are the primary beneficiary  in our q for the quarter ended march  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  under sfas no 
certain financial instruments shall be classified as a liability on the issuer s financials statements 
the company has adopted this statement  which did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
seasonality and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs  as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our assets under management  revenues or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reference is made to the information contained under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk
