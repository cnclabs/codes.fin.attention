low interest rates and accelerated federal tax depreciation schedules have also supported domestic irrigation equipment purchases 
international irrigation equipment revenues increased by million or compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase in revenues from the company s foreign operations  which increased million over fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from export sales to the middle east region due to the political unrest there and lower sales to canadian markets due to less favorable market conditions there

inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
during fiscal  the company realized dramatic and unprecedented increases in pricing for purchases of certain commodities  in particular steel products  used in the production of its products 
while the cost outlook for commodities used in the company s production of its products is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures by introducing appropriate sale price adjustments and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has certain off balance sheet arrangements as described in note p to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not believe these arrangements are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
during fiscal  the company incurred a charge of  on its guarantee of certain bank loans relating to the insolvency of a kansas dealership in which the company owned a minority equity interest 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the company to make payments in the future

in thousands note less than more than contractual obligations reference total year years years years leases m   supplemental retirement plan n   total      market conditions and fiscal outlook for fiscal  the company expects unit volume growth in the international and domestic markets for irrigation equipment  but the company remains uncertain as to the effect of future steel cost changes and the possible impact on the selling prices and demand for our products 
the company believes that it is taking appropriate action to shorten the pricing commitment period on orders received  maintain pricing discipline  prudently manage steel inventories  and place emphasis on achieving costs reductions 
the company is pleased with the unit growth it achieved in the domestic market in fiscal and with the progress of its international business units 
each of them achieved excellent growth  and improved their market position 
the markets for its international units and for export remain strong 
even though commodity prices have dropped off from last year s peak levels due to expectations for exceptional harvests and yields  and certain input costs are rising  demand drivers remain in place 
drought conditions  which continue to affect the western states  and growers needs for efficient  water saving irrigation systems will continue to drive world wide demand 
the company will continue to create shareholder value by pursuing a balance of accretive acquisitions  organic growth opportunities  share repurchases and dividend payments 
risk factors the company s domestic and international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent on the agricultural industry 
the company s domestic and international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural crop production which  in turn  depends upon many factors including total worldwide crop production  the profitability of agricultural crop production  agricultural commodity prices  aggregate net cash farm income  governmental policies regarding the agricultural sector  water and energy conservation policies  the regularity of rainfall  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as farm income decreases  farmers may postpone capital expenditures or seek cheaper alternatives in the used irrigation equipment market 
the company s profitability may be negatively affected by increases in the cost of raw materials  labor  and energy 
there is a high level of price competition in the market for irrigation equipment 
therefore  the company may not be able to recover all operating cost increases through price increases which would result in reduced profitability 
whether increased operating costs can be passed through to the customer depends on a number of factors  including farm income  the regularity of rainfall  and the price of competing products 
the cost of raw materials can be volatile and is dependent on a number of factors  including availability  demand  and freight costs 
the company s international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent on foreign market conditions 
approximately one quarter of the company s revenues are generated from international sales 
specifically  international revenues are generated in australia  canada  central and western europe  mexico  the middle east  south africa  and south america 
in addition to general economic and political stability  the company s international sales are affected by international trade barriers  including governmental policies on tariffs  taxes  and foreign currency exchange rates 
international sales are also more susceptible to disruption from political instability  armed hostilities  and similar incidents 
the company s diversified product revenues are dependent on sales to a few large customers  the loss of which could have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated from sales of its diversified products outsource manufacturing services and the sale of large diameter steel tubing 
while we anticipate that these customers will each continue to be significant outsource manufacturing customers  the loss of one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the revenues the company earns from outsource manufacturing and its overall profitability 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures 
like other manufacturing concerns  the company is subject to numerous laws and regulations which govern environmental and occupational health and safety matters 
the company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations 
permits are or may be required for some of the operations at its facilities 
although management believes that all currently required permits have been obtained by the company  as with all such permits  they are subject to revocation  modification  and renewal 
even where regulations or standards have been adopted  they are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations and implementation 
the company  in  entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency of the us federal government concerning its lindsay  nebraska facility which is included in the agency s superfund sites as discussed in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures 
management does not believe any future material capital and operational expenditures for such issues are required 
new disclosure rules regarding internal controls may increase audit risk 
beginning in fiscal year  section of the sarbanes oxley act of will require the company s annual report on form k to include a report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and a statement that the company s independent auditor has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
while the company has not yet identified any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting  there are no assurances that the company will not discover deficiencies in its internal controls as it implements new documentation and testing procedures to comply with the new section reporting requirement 
if the company discovers deficiencies or is unable to complete the work necessary to properly evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting  there is a risk that management and or the company s independent auditor may not be able to conclude that the company s internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market value of the company s investment securities fluctuates inversely with movements in interest rates because all of these investment securities bear interest at fixed rates 
accordingly  during periods of rising interest rates  the market value of these securities will decline 
however  the company does not consider itself to be subject to material market risks with respect to its portfolio of investment securities because the maturity of these securities is relatively short  making their value less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the company has manufacturing operations in the united states  france  brazil  and south africa 
the company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third party foreign suppliers 
export sales made from the united states are principally us dollar denominated 
accordingly  these sales are not subject to significant currency translation risk 
however  a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real  and the south african rand in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company attempts to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposure by monitoring foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables  and from future purchases and sales 
the company s translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is not hedged 
the most significant translation exposures are the euro  brazilian real  and the south african rand in relation to the us dollar
