the company intends to continue to increase penetration of the diy markets by solicitation of home centers 
the company s sales representatives and retail specialists maintain on going contact with home centers to provide timely product availability and product knowledge training 
to satisfy specialized requirements of the home center market  the company has developed extensive bar coding and merchandising aids and has devoted a portion of its research efforts to the development of diy products 
dealers 
in some markets  the company sells its products directly to lumber dealers 
oem relationships 
the company works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood products and oems in developing and expanding the application and sales of simpson strong tie s engineered wood connector products and simpson dura vent s gas  wood and pellet stove venting products 
sst has relationships with several of the largest manufacturers of engineered wood products  and sdv has oem relationships with several major gas fireplace and gas stove manufacturers 
in  sdv was informed by a significant gas appliance manufacturer that the customer planned to supply certain venting products from internal sources beginning in mid sales of the affected products to this customer were approximately million in  down from million in sdv expects minimal sales to this customer in the company is expanding its established facilities outside california to increase its presence and sales in markets east of the rocky mountains  although over the last three years  sales in the states east of the rocky mountains have increased only with the market generally 
since  the company has established operations in the united kingdom  opened warehouse and distribution facilities in western canada and the northeastern united states  purchased anchor products manufacturers in illinois and eastern canada and connector product manufacturers in france  denmark and western canada  and acquired the shares of the german company that it did not already own 
the european investments are intended to establish a presence in the european community through companies with existing customer bases and through servicing us based customers operating there 
the company is also developing its distribution in chile  japan  australia and new zealand 
the company intends to continue to pursue and expand operations both inside and outside of the united states see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
a company goal is to manufacture and warehouse its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services 
with respect to the diy and dealer markets  the company s strategy is to keep the customer s retail stores continuously stocked with adequate supplies of the full line of the company s products that those stores carry 
the company manages its inventory to help assure continuous product availability 
most customer orders are filled within a few days 
high levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow the company to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery 
the company s product research and development is based largely on needs that customers communicate to the company 
the company typically has developed to new products annually some of which may be produced in a range of sizes 
the company s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis  to patent them where possible  and to seek trade secret protection for others 
the company s long term strategy is to develop  acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that a complement the company s existing product lines  b can be marketed through its existing distribution channels  c might benefit from use of the simpson strong tie and simpson dura vent brand names  d are responsive to needs of the company s customers and e expand its markets geographically 
simpson strong tie overview connectors produced by simpson strong tie typically are steel devices that are used to strengthen  support and connect joints in residential and commercial construction and diy projects 
these products enhance the safety and durability of the structures in which they are installed and can save time and labor costs for the contractor 
sst s connector products increase structural integrity and improve structural resistance to seismic  wind and other forces 
applications range from building framing to deck construction to diy projects 
sst produces and markets over  standard and custom products 
in the united states  connector usage developed faster in the west than elsewhere due to the low cost and abundance of timber and to local construction practices 
increasingly  the market has been influenced both by a growing awareness that the devastation caused by seismic  wind and other disasters can be reduced through improved building codes and construction practices and by environmental concerns that contribute to the increasing cost and reduced availability of wood 
most simpson strong tie products are listed by recognized building standards agencies as complying with model building codes and are specified by architects and engineers for use in projects they are designing or supervising 
the engineered wood products industry continues to develop in response to concerns about the availability of wood  and the company believes that sst is the leading supplier of connectors for use with engineered wood products 
metal connectors  anchors and fasteners will corrode and lose load carrying capacity when installed in corrosive environments or exposed to corrosive materials 
there are many environments and materials which may cause corrosion  including ocean salt air  fire retardants  preservative treated wood  dissimilar metals  fumes and fertilizers 
the variables present in a single building environment make it impossible to accurately predict if  or when  significant corrosion will begin or reach a critical level 
this relative uncertainty makes it crucial that the specifiers be knowledgeable of the potential risks and select a product coating or metal that is suitable for the intended use 
changes in the preservative treated wood industry have created additional concerns 
effective december   the preservative treated wood industry voluntarily transitioned from chromated copper arsenate cca c used in residential applications to alternative treatments 
testing has shown that certain alternative replacement treatments are generally more corrosive that cca c 
sst publishes technical bulletins on subjects such as this and others that affect the installation and use of its products and makes them available on its website at www

the sales force maintains close working relationships with customers  develops new business  calls on architects  engineers and building officials and participates in a range of educational seminars 
simpson strong tie sells its products through an extensive distribution system comprising dealer distributors supplying thousands of retail locations nationwide  contractor distributors  home centers  lumber dealers  manufacturers of engineered wood products  and specialized contractors such as roof framers 
in recent years  sales to home centers have been one of the company s fastest growing distribution channels 
a large part of that growth was sales to the home depot which exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in each of the last three years see note to the company s consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sst s diy and dealer products are used to build projects such as decks  patio covers and shelf and bench systems 
the company believes that sst s increasing diversification into new and growing markets has reduced its vulnerability to construction industry cycles 
simpson strong tie dedicates substantial resources to customer service 
sst produces numerous publications and point of sale marketing aids to serve specifiers  distributors  retailers and users for the various markets that it serves 
these publications include general catalogs  as well as various specific catalogs  such as those for its anchor system products and the engineered wood and plated truss industries 
the catalogs and publications describe the products and provide load and installation information 
sst also maintains several linked websites centered on www 
strongtie 
com  which include catalogs  product and technical information  code reports and other general information related to sst s product lines and promotional programs 
simpson strong tie s engineers not only design and test products  but also provide engineering support for customers 
this support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing a unique application for an existing product 
sst s sales force communicates with customers in each of its marketing channels  through its publications  seminars and frequent calls 
based on its communications with customers  simpson strong tie believes that its products are essential to its customers businesses  and it is sst s policy to ship products within a few days of receiving the order 
many of sst s customers serve contractors that require rapid delivery of needed products

simpson strong tie believes that dealer and home center sales of sst products are significantly greater when the bins and racks at large dealer and home center locations are adequately stocked with appropriate products 
various retailers carry varying numbers of sst products  and sst s retail specialists are engaged in ongoing efforts to inform retailers about other sst products that can be used in their specific markets and to encourage them to add these products to better meet their customers needs 
achieving these objectives requires teamwork and significant inventory commitments between sst and the distributors and retailers 
retail specialists play a significant role in keeping the racks full and extending the product lines at the large dealer and home center level 
they help retailers order product  set up merchandising systems  stock shelves  hold product seminars and provide sst with information that is used to improve service and product mix 
simpson dura vent overview simpson dura vent s venting systems are used to vent gas furnaces and water heaters  gas fireplaces and stoves  wood and oil burning appliances and pellet stoves 
sdv s metal vents  chimneys and chimney liner systems exhaust the products of combustion to the exterior of the building and have been designed for ease of assembly and safe operation and to achieve a high level of performance 
sdv produces and markets nearly  different venting products 
the clean burning characteristics of natural gas have gained public recognition  resulting in increased market share for gas appliances in the new construction and the appliance replacement markets 
as a result  simpson dura vent has developed venting systems  such as direct vent  to address changes in appliance technology 
fluctuations in natural gas prices  however  affect demand for gas appliances 
historically  sales of wood and pellet burning stoves  considered alternative energy sources  have increased during periods of high oil and natural gas prices and energy shortages while sales of gas burning appliances have tended to decline 
simpson dura vent s objective is to expand market share in all of its distribution channels  by entering expanding markets that address energy and environmental concerns 
sdv s strategy is to capitalize on its strengths in new product development and its established distribution network and to continue its commitment to high quality and service 
sdv operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california and mississippi 
products simpson dura vent is a leading supplier of double wall type b gas vent systems  used for venting gas furnaces  water heaters  boilers and decorative gas fireplaces 
sdv s type b gas vent product line features heavy duty quality construction and a twist lock design that provides for fast and easy job site assembly compared to conventional snap together designs 
the twist lock design has broader applications and has been incorporated into sdv s gas  pellet and direct vent product lines 
sdv also markets a patented flexible vent connector  dura connect  for use between the gas appliance flue outlet and the connection to the type b gas vent installed in the ceiling 
dura connect offers a simple twist  bend and connect installation for water heaters and gas furnaces 
consumer concerns over the rising costs of natural gas and home heating oil in increased demand for alternative fuel appliances 
this has resulted in increased demand for sdv s all fuel chimney and pellet vent products 
the gas fireplace market has evolved into two basic types of fireplace top vent fireplaces that are vented with the standard type b gas vent and direct vent fireplaces that use a special double wall venting system 
sdv s direct vent system is designed not only to exhaust the flue products  but also to draw in outside air for combustion  an important feature in modern energy efficient home construction 
the direct vent gas fireplace systems provide ease of installation  permitting horizontal through the wall venting or standard vertical through the roof venting 
sdv has established relationships with several large manufacturers of gas stoves and gas fireplaces to supply direct vent venting products 
in  sdv expanded its direct vent product line to include both co axial and co linear direct vent systems for venting gas stoves and gas inserts into existing masonry chimneys or existing factory built metal chimneys 
new product development simpson dura vent has gained industry recognition by offering innovative new products that meet changing needs of customers 
sdv representatives serve on industry committees concerned with issues such as new appliance standards and government regulations 
sdv s research and development expense for the three years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
sdv also maintains working relationships with research and development departments of major appliance manufacturers  providing prototypes for field testing and conducting tests in sdv s testing laboratory 
sdv believes that such relationships provide competitive advantages 
for example  sdv introduced the first direct vent system for direct vent gas appliances 
in  sdv developed stainless steel flexible relining systems for masonry chimneys 
these systems are used to resize and retrofit masonry chimneys to accommodate wood burning and pellet burning fireplace inserts 
in  sdv introduced duratech  a twin walled insulated chimney system for use on wood burning stoves  fireplaces and oil fired appliances 
this product line has been designed and manufactured to a new standard of excellence 
it is constructed from stainless steel and incorporates blanket insulation for enhanced safety and efficiency 
sales and marketing simpson dura vent s sales organization consists of a director of sales and marketing  a marketing communications manager  regional sales managers  and independent representative agencies 
sdv markets venting systems for both gas and wood burning appliances through wholesale distributors in the united states  canada and australia to the hvac heating  ventilating and air conditioning and phc plumbing  heating and cooling contractor markets  and to fireplace specialty shop distributors 
these customers sell to contractor and diy markets 
sdv also markets venting products to home center and hardware store chains 
sdv has established oem relationships with several major gas fireplace and gas stove manufacturers  which sdv believes are leaders in the direct vent gas appliance market see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
simpson dura vent responds to technological changes occurring in the industry through new product development and has developed a reputation for quality and service to its customers 
to reinforce its reputation for quality  sdv produces extensive sales support literature and advertising materials 
recognizing the difficulty that customers and users may have in understanding new  complex venting requirements  sdv publishes a venting handbook to assist contractors  building officials and retail outlets with the science of proper venting 
advertising and promotional materials have been designed to be used by distributors and their customers  as well as home centers and hardware chains 
to enhance its marketing effort  sdv has developed a website  www 
duravent 
com  that includes product descriptions  catalogs and installation instructions  as well as a direct link to sdv s customer service and engineering departments 
manufacturing process the company has concentrated on making its manufacturing processes as efficient as possible without compromising quality or flexibility necessary to serve the needs of its customers 
the company has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes 
the company s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs  even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications 
the company s development of specialized manufacturing processes also has permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation 
the company sources some products from third party vendors  both domestically and internationally 
the company is committed to helping people build safer structures economically through the design  engineering and manufacturing of structural connectors  pre fabricated shearwalls  anchors and related products 
to this end  the company has developed a quality management system that employs numerous quality control procedures  such as computer generated work orders  constant review of parts as they are produced and frequent quality testing see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since  simpson strong tie s quality management system has been registered under iso  an internationally recognized set of quality assurance standards 
sst achieved registration under the new iso standard for its operations in north america and england in the first quarter of and is working towards registration for its operations in denmark and france 
the company believes that iso registration is becoming increasingly important to us companies 
simpson strong tie operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california  texas  ohio  florida  connecticut  illinois  washington  british columbia  ontario  england  france  denmark  germany and poland 
sst also stocks its products in scotland  austria and chile 
most of sst s products are produced with a high level of automation  using progressive dies run in automatic presses making parts from coiled sheet steel at rates that often exceed strokes per minute 
sst produces over million product pieces per year 
most of sst s products skus are bar coded with upc numbers for easy identification  and nearly all of the products sold to home centers are labeled with bar codes 
sst has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products because of the need to produce these products close to the customer and to provide backup capacity 
the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual  blanking and numerically controlled nc processes which include robotic welders  lasers and turret punches 
this capability allows sst to produce products with little redesign or set up time  facilitating rapid turnaround for customers 
new tooling is also highly automated 
dies are designed and produced using computer aided design cad and computer aided machining cam systems 
cad cam capability enables sst to create multiple dies rapidly and design them to high standards 
the company is constantly reviewing its product line to reduce manufacturing costs  increase automation  and take advantage of new types of materials 
for example  in recent years sst has introduced multiple products made from an engineered composite plastic  the anchormate  the strapmate and the anchor bolt stabilizer 
simpson dura vent operates manufacturing and warehouse facilities in california and mississippi 
sdv produces component parts for venting systems using nc controlled punch presses equipped with high speed progressive and compound tooling 
sdv s vent pipe and elbow assembly lines are automated  to produce finished products efficiently from large coils of steel and aluminum 
upc bar coding and computer tracking systems provide sdv s industrial engineers and production supervisors with real time productivity tools to measure and evaluate current production rates  methods and equipment 
most of the company s current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
for example  the loma prieta earthquake in northern california destroyed a freeway and caused other major damage within a few miles of the company s facilities in san leandro  california  and the earthquake in northridge  california  in january  destroyed several freeways and numerous buildings in the region in which the company s facilities in brea are located 
the company has developed a disaster recovery plan  but it does not carry earthquake insurance on its buildings or its equipment 
other insurance that it carries is limited and not likely to be adequate to cover all of the company s resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits in the event of a major natural disaster in the future 
if a natural disaster were to render one or more of the company s manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  the company s business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
regulation the design  capacity and quality of most of the company s products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
such regulations and standards are highly technical and complex and are subject to frequent revision 
the failure of the company s products or manufacturing processes to comply with any of such regulations and standards could impair the company s ability to manufacture and market its products profitably and could materially and adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
simpson strong tie s product lines are subject to federal  state  county  municipal and other governmental and quasi governmental regulations that affect product design  development  testing  applications  marketing  sales  installation and use 
most sst products are recognized by building code and standards agencies 
agencies that recognize company products include the international conference of the building officials icbo  the building officials and code administrators boca  the southern building code congress international sbcci  the international code council  the city of los angeles  the state of florida  and the california division of state architecture 
these and other code agencies adopt various testing and design standards and incorporate them into their related building codes 
with the adoption of the international residential code and the international building code  these standards have become more uniformly applied and are recognized throughout the country  rather than by only the jurisdictions covered by the respective agencies 
sst considers code recognition to be a significant marketing tool and devotes considerable effort to obtaining and maintaining appropriate approvals for its products 
sst believes that architects  engineers  contractors and other customers are less likely to purchase structural products that lack the appropriate code acceptance if code accepted competitive products are available 
sst s management actively participates in industry related professional associations to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide information to regulatory agencies 
simpson dura vent operates under a complex regulatory environment that includes appliance and venting performance standards related to safety  energy efficiency and air quality 
gas venting regulations are contained in the national fuel gas code nfgc  while safety and performance regulations for wood burning appliances and chimney systems are contained in a national fire protection association standard nfpa 
standards for testing gas vents and chimneys are developed by testing laboratories such as underwriter s laboratories ul in compliance with the american national standards institute 
clean air standards for both gas and wood burning appliances are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa 
energy efficiency standards are regulated by the department of energy doe under the authority of the national appliance energy conservation act 
under this act  the doe periodically reviews the necessity for increased efficiency standards with respect to gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
a substantial percentage of sdv s type b gas vent sales are for gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
minimum appliance efficiency standards are being considered that could negatively affect sales of type b gas vents  which could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition if the standards and regulations contained in the nfgc and nfpa are ultimately adopted by national building code organizations such as icbo  boca and sbcci 
in turn  the various building codes could be adopted by local municipalities  resulting in enforcement through the building permit process 
safety  air quality and energy efficiency requirements are enforced by local air quality districts and municipalities by requiring proper ul  epa and doe labels on appliances and venting systems 
competition the company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates 
this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers 
while price is an important factor  the company competes on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  technical support  service  field support and product innovation 
as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes  simpson strong tie s markets tend to differ by region 
within these regions  sst competes with companies of varying size  several of which also distribute their products nationally 
the venting industry is highly competitive 
sdv s principal competitors include the selkirk division of tinicum capital partners lp  hart cooley  inc and american metal products  inc 
both now owned by tomkins plc  metal fab  inc and the air jet division of general products co  now owned by thermatrue 
the company believes that metal fab  inc and air jet tend to be more regional than sdv  and that they have smaller shares of the national market than sdv 
raw materials the principal raw material used by the company is steel  including stainless steel  and is generally ordered to specific american society of testing and materials astm standards 
other raw materials include aluminum  aluminum alloys and ceramic and other insulation materials  which are used by simpson dura vent  and cartons  which are used by both sst and sdv 
the company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
the company s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the company s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  import duties and other trade restrictions 
steel prices rose in the latter half of and are expected to continue to increase 
several factors have contributed to these price increases 
demand  particularly from china  is very high and this has constrained supplies available to buyers in the united states 
in addition  weakness in the us dollar has discouraged foreign steel mills from supplying the us market despite the lifting of tariffs on certain types of imported steel 
finally  major domestic integrated steel producers have consolidated over the last several years 
all of these factors could have an adverse effect on the company s cost and availability of steel in the company might not be able to increase its product prices to correspond to increases in raw materials prices without materially and adversely affecting its sales and profits 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights the company s subsidiaries have us and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that they currently manufacture and market 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of the subsidiaries products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
the company s subsidiaries are continuing to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although the company s subsidiaries do not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  the company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that its subsidiaries may develop 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that patents will be issued pursuant to pending patent applications 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of the company s products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to the company s proprietary technology 
in addition to seeking patent protection  the company also relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its know how or other proprietary information 
in attempting to protect its proprietary information  the company expects that it may sometimes be necessary to initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that the company believes have infringed or are infringing on the company s rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons 
if the company were to be unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its significant products  the company s business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
acquisitions and expansion into new markets the company s future growth  if any  may depend to some extent on its ability to penetrate new markets  both domestically and internationally 
see industry and market trends and business strategy 
therefore  the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurring of additional debt  and impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
if an acquisition occurs  no assurance can be given as to its effect on the company s business or operating results 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
construction customs  standards  techniques and methods in international markets differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets for the company may be unfamiliar to the company and compliance may be substantially more costly than the company anticipates 
as a result  it may become necessary for the company to redesign products or to invent or design new products in order to compete effectively and profitably outside the united states or in markets that are new to the company in the united states 
the company expects that significant time will be required for it to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of the company s products  political instability  currency controls  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to penetrate these markets or that any such market penetration can be achieved on a timely basis or profitably 
if the company is not successful in penetrating these markets within a reasonable time  it will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments it will have made in attempting to do so

seasonality and cyclicality the company s sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  the company s sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters of the year  as retailers and contractors purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  demand for the company s products and the company s results of operations are significantly affected by weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate  installation of certain of the company s products 
political and economic events can also affect the company s revenues 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases  and sales anticipated in one quarter may occur in another quarter  thereby affecting both quarters results 
in addition  the company incurs significant expenses as it develops  produces and markets its products in anticipation of future orders 
products typically are shipped as orders are received  and accordingly the company operates with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
if sales fall below the company s expectations  operating results would be adversely affected for the relevant quarters  as expenses based on those expectations will already have been incurred 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  the availability of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather and other factors and trends  none of which is within the company s control 
declines in commercial and residential construction may be expected to reduce the demand for the company s products 
the company cannot provide any assurance that its business will not be adversely affected by future negative economic or construction industry performance or that future declines in construction activity or the demand for the company s products will not have material adverse effects on the company and its business and financial condition
