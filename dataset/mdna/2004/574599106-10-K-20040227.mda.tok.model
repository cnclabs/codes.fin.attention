the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions  pricing pressures  relationships with key customers  industry consolidation of retailers  wholesalers and builders  shifts in distribution  the influence of e commerce  and other factors discussed in the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
the company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new construction market 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure  fluctuations in european currencies primarily the european euro and great britain pound  the importance of and the company s relationships with home centers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s sales in as distributors of home improvement and building products and the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition 
historically  the company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
the company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds  which aggregated million  and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million  at december  the investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period  or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions 
the investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity  net of tax effect  in other comprehensive income loss 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
future changes in market conditions  the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
on january   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
this test indicated that goodwill related to certain european businesses was impaired 
the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax in the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of  the company also recognized a non cash impairment charge of million related to a business unit in the united kingdom  as discussed in business segment results 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures and generally a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its individual business units were greater than the carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
the company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants  lawyers and actuaries 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to percent from percent  which reflects the decline in long term interest rates 
the assumed asset return is percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the company s underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to million from million in this is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and company contributions 
the plan assets in had a net gain of approximately percent as compared with an increase of percent for the largest  plan benchmark 
the company s projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental pension plans was million for compared with million for the company s underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets for its foreign pension plans was million for compared with million for the company expects pension expense for its defined benefit plans to decrease by approximately million in  principally due to higher asset returns achieved in compared with the projection 
if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was percent instead of percent  the pension expense for would increase by approximately million 
the company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain operating assets  in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december   particularly related to its after tax capital loss carryforward of million 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to lifetime  under certain circumstances  of the original purchaser 
at the time of the sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
the company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the behr litigation settlement in in  the company received a fraction of the claims originally estimated and reduced its accrual for litigation settlement by million 
corporate development strategy acquisitions over the last several years have enabled the company to build a unique critical mass that has given the company a strong position in the markets it serves and has increased the company s importance to its customers 
the company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to build greater value for its shareholders 
going forward  the company will have a more balanced growth strategy of internal growth  share repurchases and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital 
as part of its strategic planning  the company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses are core to continuing operations 
the company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of its corporate strategic planning and  in the first quarter of  has determined that several european businesses are not core to the company s long term growth strategy and  accordingly  has embarked on a plan of disposition 
these businesses had combined net sales in excess of million and an approximate net book value of million 
the company expects net proceeds from the dispositions to exceed million 
the dispositions are expected to be completed within the next twelve months and the company expects to recognize a modest net loss upon the disposition of all of these businesses 
first quarter results will include a charge to reflect those businesses that are expected to be divested at a loss 
any gains resulting from the disposition of individual businesses will be recognized as such transactions are completed

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations  long term bank debt and other borrowings  and by the issuance of company common stock  including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 
bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds 
the credit lines with banks syndicated in the united states at december  include a billion amended and restated year revolving credit agreement due and payable in november and a million day revolving credit agreement that expires in november these agreements allow for borrowings denominated in us dollars or european euros 
the previous day revolving credit agreement expired in november there were no borrowings under either agreement during interest is payable on borrowings under these agreements based on various floating rate options as selected by the company

the company had cash and cash investments of million at december  as a result of strong cash flows from operations and the disposition of certain businesses in during  the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend percent to 
per common share 
this marks the th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
although the company is aware of the greater interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend payout in recent years  the company continues to believe that its shareholders long term interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its earnings in the future growth of the company 
maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the company s financial strategies 
the company s total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to percent at december  from percent at december  the company s working capital ratio was to and to at december  and  respectively 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use derivatives for trading purposes 
the derivatives used by the company for the year ended december  consist of interest rate swaps entered into late in  for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt which is expected to reduce interest expense  given current interest rates 
certain of the company s european operations also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations related to the united states dollar and the great britain pound 
generally  under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the interest rate swaps are considered a fair value hedge and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense or income over the term of the agreement 
for fair value hedge transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recorded in determining earnings 
the average variable interest rates are based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a fixed adjustment factor 
the average effective rate on the interest rate swaps is 
the interest rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of million of the company s fixed rate debt due july  at an interest rate of 
the hedge is considered percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item
