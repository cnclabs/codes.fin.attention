the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
overview platinum holdings is a bermuda holding company organized on april  the company provides property and marine  casualty and finite reinsurance coverages to a diverse clientele of insurers and select reinsurers on a worldwide basis 
the company operates through three licensed reinsurance subsidiaries platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda 
in november  platinum holdings completed an initial public offering of  common shares 
concurrent with the public offering  platinum holdings sold  common shares to the st 
paul companies  inc st 
paul and  common shares to renaissancere holdings ltd 
renaissancere in private placements 
in addition to the common shares issued  the company issued equity security units  consisting of a contract to purchase common shares in and an ownership interest in a senior note due also  concurrent with these transactions  the company and st 
paul entered into several agreements for the transfer of continuing reinsurance business and certain related assets of st 
paul 
among these agreements were quota share retrocession agreements effective november  the quota share retrocession agreements under which the company assumed from st

critical accounting policies it is important to understand the company s accounting policies in order to understand its financial position and results of operations 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the relevant periods 
certain of the estimates and assumptions result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies involve written and unearned premium  unpaid losses and lae  reinsurance  investments  income taxes and stock based compensation 
premiums assumed reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues when premiums become earned proportionately over the coverage period 
net premiums earned are recorded in the statement of income  net of the cost of retrocession 
net premiums written not yet recognized as revenue are recorded in the balance sheet as unearned premiums  gross of any ceded unearned premiums 
due to the nature of reinsurance  ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums subsequent to the contract coverage period 
consequently  reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by estimates of premiums which are earned but not reported ebnr 
along with estimating ebnr the company records the expenses associated with these premiums in the form of losses  lae and commissions 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and could significantly impact earnings in the period they are recorded 
due to the time lag inherent in the reporting of premiums by ceding companies  a significant portion of amounts included as premiums written and receivable represents estimated premiums  net of commissions  and is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses under these contracts  are recognized based upon the losses recorded under those contracts 
reinstatement premiums and additional premiums are recognized in accordance with the provisions of assumed reinsurance contracts  based on losses recorded under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of a reinsurance contract to its full amount  generally coinciding with the payment by the reinsurer of losses 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are earned over the remaining policy term 
additional premiums are those premiums triggered by losses and not related to reinstatement of limits and are earned immediately 
an allowance for uncollectible premiums is established for possible non payment of such amounts due  as deemed necessary 
unpaid losses and lae the most significant judgment made by management in the preparation of financial statements is the estimation of unpaid losses and lae liabilities also referred to as loss reserves 
these liabilities are balance sheet estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and lae for reinsured claims which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
every quarter  the company s actuaries prepare estimates of the loss reserves based on established actuarial techniques 
because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and lae is uncertain  we believe that quantitative techniques to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment 
company management reviews these estimates and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the company s financial statements 
loss reserves include estimates of the cost of claims that were reported but not yet paid case reserves and the cost of claims that were incurred but not reported ibnr 
case reserves are usually based upon claim reports received from ceding companies  and may be increased or reduced by the company s claims personnel 
ibnr is based on actuarial methods including the loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method and the chain ladder method 
ibnr related to a specific event may be based on the company s estimated exposure to an industry loss 
this estimation process may include the use of catastrophe modeling software 
generally  initial actuarial estimates of ibnr not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each underwriting year for each class of business 
actual paid losses and case reserves reported losses are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine ibnr 
the initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on i contract by contract expected loss ratios derived from the company s pricing process  and ii historical loss ratios of the company and st 
paul re adjusted for rate changes and trends 
these judgments will take into account management s view of past  current and future i market conditions  ii changes in the business underwritten  iii changes in timing of the emergence of claims and iv other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported  actuarial estimates of ibnr are based on the bornhuetter ferguson and the chain ladder techniques 
the bornhuetter ferguson technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses  taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine a new estimate of expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
the chain ladder technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses to determine a new estimate of expected ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are a large number of reported losses with significant statistical credibility and a relatively stable pattern of reported losses 
the pattern of reported losses is determined utilizing actuarial analysis including judgment and is based on historical patterns of the recording of paid losses and case reserves to the company  as well as industry patterns 
information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate 
for property and health coverages these patterns indicate that a substantial portion of the ultimate losses are reported within to years after the contract is effective 
casualty patterns can vary from years to well over years depending on the type of business 
while the company commenced operations in  the business written is sufficiently similar to the historical business of st 
paul re that the company uses the historical loss experience of this business to estimate its initial expected ultimate losses and its expected patterns of reported losses 
these patterns can span more than a decade and  given its own limited history  the availability of the st 
paul re data is a valuable asset to the company 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish liabilities until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a loss 
when an event occurs of sufficient magnitude we may establish a specific ibnr reserve 
generally  this involves a catastrophe occurrence which affects many ceding company clients 
ultimate losses and lae are based on management s judgment that reflects estimates gathered from ceding company clients  estimates of insurance industry losses gathered from public sources and estimates from catastrophe modeling software 
estimated amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires on unpaid losses and lae are determined based on the company s estimate of ultimate losses and lae and the terms and conditions of its retrocessional contracts 
these amounts are reflected as assets 
unpaid losses and lae represent management s best estimates  at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred  and it is possible that the ultimate liability may materially differ from such estimates 
such estimates are not precise because  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors 
the uncertainty inherent in loss estimation is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages  such as umbrella liability  general and product liability  professional liability  directors and officers liability and automobile liability  where information  such as required medical treatment and costs for bodily injury claims  only emerges over time 
in the overall loss reserving process  provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered 
the uncertainty inherent in the reserving process for primary insurers is even greater for the reinsurer 
this is because of  but not limited to  the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to the reinsurer and differing reserving practices among ceding companies 
loss reserves are refined and adjusted as new information becomes available 
any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made 
reinsurance written premiums  earned premiums  incurred losses and lae reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions 
reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and ceded transactions when risk transfer requirements have been met 
evaluating risk transfer involves significant assumptions relating to the amount and timing of expected cash flows  as well as the interpretation of underlying contract terms 
reinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are generally accounted for as reinsurance deposit liabilities with interest expense charged to other income and credited to the liability 
investments in accordance with our investment guidelines  our investments consist largely of high grade marketable fixed income securities 
fixed maturities owned that the company may not have the positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes 
fixed maturities owned that the company has the intent to sell prior to maturity are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in other income 
securities classified as trading securities are generally foreign currency denominated securities intended to match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in order to minimize net exposures arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
in addition  unrealized depreciation in the value of individual securities considered by management to be other than temporary is charged to income in the period it is determined 
investment income is recorded when earned and includes the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments 
income taxes platinum holdings and platinum bermuda are domiciled in bermuda 
the company also has subsidiaries in the united states  united kingdom and ireland that are subject to the tax laws thereof 
the company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
stock based compensation during  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for awards of stock based compensation to employees sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas requires that the fair value of shares granted under the company s share option plan subsequent to adoption of sfas be amortized in earnings over the vesting periods 
the fair value of the share options granted are determined through the use of an option pricing model 
sfas amends sfas and provides transitioning guidance for a voluntary adoption of fas as well as amends the disclosure requirements of sfas for the period from november  through december   the company has elected to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees established by accounting principles board opinion no

under apb  if the exercise price of the company s employee share options is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
reinsurance industry conditions and trends the reinsurance industry historically has been cyclical  characterized by periods of price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods of favorable pricing due to shortages of underwriting capacity 
cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile developments  including natural and other disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions and other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  the frequency and severity of which are inherently difficult to predict 
property and casualty reinsurance rates often rise in the aftermath of significant catastrophe losses 
as liabilities are established to cover expected claims  the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes 
the industry is also affected by changes in the propensity of courts to expand insurance coverage and grant large liability awards  as well as fluctuations in interest rates  inflation and other changes in the economic environment that affect market prices of investments 
as a result of favorable loss levels and strong investment returns beginning in the mid s  the reinsurance industry entered a cycle of increased competition and industry capacity that pushed property and casualty premium rates down 
in  there were several significant worldwide catastrophic events that resulted in industry insured losses of approximately billion 
these losses  and the subsequent contraction of reinsurance capacity in the market  resulted in improvements in rates  terms and conditions beginning with january renewals 
these improvements continued in as capacity continued to contract due to a number of catastrophe events  particularly the terrorist attack of september  with insured losses currently estimated to be in excess of billion  the terrorist attack resulted in the largest single insured loss ever experienced by the industry 
by comparison  the largest industry insured catastrophic event prior to the attack was hurricane andrew in with billion in estimated losses 
shortly after the property catastrophe events of and  many reinsurance companies began to recognize poor results in their casualty business stemming from business underwritten from to the result was substantial loss reserve charges summing to tens of billions of dollars and a further decrease in industry capacity 
in addition the capital of a number of large companies was further reduced by poor investment results 
in late and through several new companies were started 
some existing companies raised new capital and others exited the business 
the new capital invested in the industry was substantially less than the capital reduction from losses  exited companies  and poor investment results 
as a result  rate increases in were significantly higher than rates still rose in though at a lower rate 
we believe that the shortage in property reinsurance capacity subsequent to the events of and has substantially abated 
effective rate changes for our property business averaged through we believe that there will be more adverse casualty development from reinsurers who underwrote casualty business in the late s 
we believe there will be sustained upward pressure on casualty rates as these reserve shortfalls are recognized 
during our effective rate change for our casualty business was between 
results of operations platinum holdings was incorporated on april  under the laws of bermuda to hold subsidiaries that provide property  casualty  and other reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers on a worldwide basis and  in november  completed a public offering and assumed certain rights and obligations of the reinsurance business from st 
paul re 
consequently  the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  shareholders equity and cash flows include all activity from incorporation on april  through december  the underwriting operations  as well as substantially all other operations of the company commenced in november generally  the results of operations reflect the period from november  through december  the period and are not comparable to the results of operations for the year ended december  net income was  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase is primarily because was the company s first complete year of operations and the period represents a two month period  during which the company had minimal underwriting activity 
additional factors affecting the comparison include the growth in the business underwritten in over  favorable development in of unpaid losses and lae as of december  of approximately  as well as improved profitability relating to net premiums earned in  and increased investment income resulting from growth in invested assets in the united states insurance industry incurred some significant catastrophe losses in however  catastrophe losses in the company s portfolio were relatively low as most catastrophe claims remained at the primary or ceding company level 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a charge of  for expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer 
income tax expenses of  resulted in an effective tax rate of for the year 
net premiums written for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily because includes a full year of underwriting activity and the period includes two months 
generally  the last two months of a year have a relatively small amount of net premiums written 
however  net premiums written in the period include  of unearned premiums assumed from st 
paul under the quota share retrocession agreements representing the remaining unearned premiums related to contracts written by st 
paul re during the first ten months of premiums written are based partially on estimates of ultimate premiums from reinsurance contracts and the estimates are updated quarterly 
reductions in premiums estimated for the underwriting year in the casualty segment  a portion of which was written and earned by st 
paul re  reduced the company s net premiums written in by approximately  net premiums earned for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
similar to net premiums written  net premiums earned in represents twelve months of underwriting activity whereas the period represents two months 
net premiums earned are recognized subsequent to net premiums written 
net premiums earned in the period are relatively low due to the commencement of operations during net premiums earned for reflect business underwritten in and while net premiums earned in the period reflect only business underwritten in the reduction in of net premiums written in the casualty segment resulted in a reduction of net premiums earned of approximately  net premiums earned as a percentage of net premiums written for and the period were and  respectively 
the ratio is consistent with the growth of the business underwritten in over the ratio in the period is low due to the commencement of operations in and the unearned premium assumed from st 
paul re recorded as net premiums written in the period 
net investment income was  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase is primarily because includes a full year of investment income and the period includes two months 
the annualized investment yield for and the period was and  respectively 
the investment yield in reflects prevailing interest rates during net investment income increased during as the company s invested assets increased as a result of positive cash flow from operations 
the yield in the period reflects a delay in the investment of short term investments and cash into fixed maturities during the period pending receipt of certain required regulatory approvals from the united kingdom and the state of maryland 
net realized gains on investments were  and  in and the period  respectively  and are the result of investment sale activity to manage the credit quality and duration of the investment portfolio 
other income was  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively  and represents earnings on a small number of reinsurance contracts in the finite risk segment accounted for as deposits 
other income in also includes  of net unrealized losses relating to changes in fair value of fixed maturities classified as trading 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses for the year ended december  and the period  were  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses arise from the valuation in us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the company matches foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rates 
losses and lae were  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase in losses and lae is due to the increase in net premiums earned in over the period 
the ratios of losses and lae to premiums earned  also referred to as loss ratios  were and for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
while losses and lae in include provisions for various catastrophe losses  the period had no catastrophe losses 
the united states insurance industry incurred some significant catastrophe losses in however  catastrophe losses in the company s portfolio were relatively low as most catastrophe claims remained at the primary or ceding company level 
losses and lae in included a reduction is the estimated liability as of december  of  of which  relates to the reduction in of premiums originally estimated and accrued in in the casualty segment 
the remaining  relates to favorable development 
unpaid losses and lae at december  were based largely on initial expected ultimate loss ratios 
throughout actual reported losses were monitored against expected patterns of reported loss 
as actual reported losses continued to be less than expected reported losses  estimates of expected ultimate losses were reduced 
this principally affected property coverages in the property and marine and finite risk segments where a substantial portion of the ultimate losses is expected to be reported to the company within two years 
additionally  losses and lae in were favorably impacted by improved profitability relating to net earned premium in on business underwritten in acquisition expenses  including brokerage  commissions and other direct underwriting expenses associated with underwriting activities  were  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase in acquisition expenses is due to the increase in net premiums earned in over the period 
although acquisition ratios in varied by operating segment and by type of business  the resulting ratios of acquisition expenses to net premiums earned for and the period were comparable at and  respectively 
operating expenses include other underwriting expenses related to the reinsurance operations as well as costs associated with the holding company operations of platinum holdings and were  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses results from representing twelve months of operations whereas the period represents two months  modest growth in staff  fees relating to an agreement with renaissancere and office relocation expenses in operating expenses in include a charge for  for the expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer 
operating expenses in the period include one time expenses of  incurred in connection with the completion of the public offering  the formation of the company and the assumption of business from st 
paul 
interest expense for the year ended december  and the period was  and  respectively  and relates to amounts payable under the company s equity security units which are classified as debt obligations on the company s balance sheet 
the increase is because includes a full year of interest expense and the period includes two months 
income tax expense for the year ended december  and the period was  and  respectively 
the increase in net income tax expense is due to the increase in income before taxes in over the period 
the resulting effective tax rates were and for the and the period  respectively 
the effective tax rate for was increased by a significant amount of income derived from business underwritten in  assumed and retained by platinum us and subject to us corporate tax 
the effective tax rate for was also affected by expenses related to the separation and consulting agreement with the company s former chief executive officer that were incurred by platinum holdings that  when combined with the income before income tax expense from subsidiaries in taxable jurisdictions  increased the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate in the period was higher than any tax rate of the taxable jurisdictions in which the company operates because of significant start up expenses incurred by platinum holdings for which no tax benefit was available 
segment information the company conducts its worldwide reinsurance business through three operating segments property and marine  casualty and finite risk 
in managing the company s operating segments  management uses measures such as underwriting income and underwriting ratios to evaluate segment performance 
management does not allocate by segment its assets or certain income and expenses such as investment income  interest expense and certain corporate expenses 
segment underwriting income is reconciled to income before income taxes 
the measures used by management in evaluating the company s operating segments should not be used as a substitute for measures determined under us gaap

casualty the casualty operating segment includes principally reinsurance treaties that cover umbrella liability  general and product liability  professional liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation  casualty clash and automobile liability 
this segment also includes accident and health reinsurance treaties  which are predominantly reinsurance of health insurance products 
most of our casualty reinsurance business is written on an excess of loss basis 
this operating segment generated and of the company s net premiums written for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the percentage in the period was impacted by the unearned premiums assumed under the quota share retrocession agreements being recorded as net premiums written 
we believe the percentage is more reflective of the casualty component of our business 
throughout the percentage of total net premiums written generated from our casualty segment has been increasing as a result of increased underwriting activity in an improving marketplace 
net premiums written for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily because includes a full year of underwriting activity and the period includes two months 
generally  the last two months of a year have a relatively small amount of net premiums written

losses and lae were  and  for the year ended december  and the period  respectively 
the increase in losses and lae is related to the increase in net premiums earned in over the period 
the loss ratios incurred for the casualty segment in and the period were and  respectively 
the loss ratio on business underwritten in is lower than the loss ratio for business underwritten in due to rate increases achieved during the losses and lae in includes amounts from business underwritten in and business underwritten in while the period includes amounts only from business underwritten in losses and lae in included a reduction is the estimated liability as of december  of  of which  relates to the reduction in of premiums originally estimated and accrued in the period

the decline in the loss ratio is further influenced by a shift in the mix of business toward contracts that have lower loss ratios and higher expense ratios 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the resulting acquisition expense ratios for and the period were and  respectively 
the ratios reflect the mix of business and effects of differences in terms and conditions of various contracts as well as the shift in the mix of business discussed in the preceding paragraph 
other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively  and represent costs such as salaries  rent and like items 
other underwriting expenses in the period include  of one time expenses incurred in connection with the completion of the public offering  the formation of the company and the assumption of business from st 
paul 
finite risk the finite risk operating segment includes principally structured reinsurance contracts with ceding companies whose needs may not be met efficiently through traditional reinsurance products 
the company focuses on providing such clients with customized solutions for their financial management needs 
the classes of risks underwritten in the finite risk segment are generally consistent with the classes covered using traditional products 
at the time the company was formed in  management had the opportunity to select an initial portfolio of finite risk contracts to be assumed from st 
paul under the quota share retrocession agreements that management believed would generate significant underwriting gains 
profitability in this segment was favorably influenced by contractual terms and conditions that provided for greater profit opportunity as a result of losses incurred by st 
paul re 
this operating segment generated and of the company s net premiums written in and the period  respectively 
net premiums written for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily because includes a full year of underwriting activity and the period includes two months 
the finite risk portfolio consists of a small number of contracts which can be large in premium size and are written on an intermittent basis 
consequently net premiums written are expected to vary significantly from year to year 
a few significant finite quota share treaties were underwritten in the latter part of and early that together produced net premiums written of  in net premiums earned for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
similar to net premiums written  net premiums earned in includes a full year of underwriting activity whereas the net premiums earned in the period includes two months 
in addition  net premiums earned are recognized subsequent to net premiums written 
the net premiums earned in reflects premiums from contracts underwritten in and whereas the net premiums earned in the period only reflects premiums from contracts underwritten in since there was no business underwritten prior to net premiums earned as a percentage of net premiums written in and the period increased from and  respectively 
the ratio is consistent with the growth of the business underwritten in the latter part of and through the ratio for the period is low due to the commencement of operations in and the unearned premium assumed from st 
paul recorded as net premiums written in the period 
losses and lae for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the increase in losses and lae is related to the increase in net premiums earned in over the period 
the loss ratios incurred for the finite risk segment in and the period were and  respectively 
both and the period benefited from the absence of any catastrophe losses 
in there was a significantly greater amount of finite quota share contracts that had higher loss ratios 
this affect was partially mitigated by favorable development in of losses and lae as of december  of approximately  which includes the effect of commutations 
acquisition costs for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively 
the increase in acquisition expenses is related to the increase in net premiums earned in over the period 
the resulting acquisition expense ratios in and the period were and  respectively 
the ratios reflect the mix of business and effects of differences in terms and conditions of various contracts 
other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  and the period were  and  respectively  and represent costs such as salaries  rent and like items 
the increase is primarily because includes a full year of operations and the period includes two months

platinum holdings is a holding company that conducts no reinsurance operations of its own 
all of its reinsurance operations are conducted through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda 
as a holding company  the cash flow of platinum holdings consists primarily of dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries 
platinum holdings depends on such payments to receive funds for general corporate purposes and to meet its obligations  including the contract adjustment payments related to the equity security units and the payment of any dividends to its shareholders 
platinum holdings had a day committed credit facility with a group of banks which provided  of aggregate borrowing capacity 
the credit facility expired on august  platinum holdings did not renew its credit facility because the company believes its financial position and operations are able to provide adequate liquidity 
as part of the company s ongoing business strategy  we may  from time to time  seek to secure external financing and may also access the public capital markets 
liquidity requirements the principal consolidated cash requirements of the company are the payment of losses and lae  commissions  brokerages  operating expenses  dividends to its shareholders  the servicing of debt including interest payments on the senior notes and contract adjustment payments on the purchase contracts included in the company s equity security units  the acquisition of and investment in businesses  capital expenditures  premiums retroceded and excise taxes 
platinum uk and platinum bermuda are not licensed  approved or accredited as reinsurers anywhere in the united states and  therefore  under the terms of most of their contracts with united states ceding companies  they are required to provide security to their ceding companies for unpaid ceded liabilities in a form acceptable to state insurance commissioners 
typically  this type of security takes the form of a letter of credit issued by an acceptable bank  the establishment of a trust  or a cash advance 
platinum uk and platinum bermuda expect to obtain letters of credit through commercial banks and may be required to provide the banks with a security interest in certain of platinum uk s and platinum bermuda s investments 
the payment of dividends and other distributions from the company s regulated reinsurance subsidiaries is limited by applicable laws and statutory requirements of the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate  including bermuda  the united states and the united kingdom 
based on the regulatory restrictions of the applicable jurisdictions  the maximum amount available for payment of dividends or other distributions by the reinsurance subsidiaries of the company in without prior regulatory approval is estimated to be platinum holdings operates a treasury department that is responsible for the following functions managing banking relationships  capital raising activities  including equity and debt issues  managing platinum holdings overall cash and liquidity positions  and overseeing the payment of internal and external dividends and the settlement of interest obligations 
management believes that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of the company s subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its liquidity needs over the foreseeable future 
cash flow available to the company may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience and the presence or absence of large catastrophic events 
economic conditions periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct effect on the company s underwriting operations 
significant inflationary or recessionary periods can  however  impact the company s underwriting operations and investment portfolio 
management considers the potential impact of economic trends in estimating its unpaid losses and lae 
management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains assist in estimating ultimate claim costs and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on the company 
capital expenditures none of platinum holdings  platinum us  platinum uk or platinum bermuda have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years equity security units   operating leases      off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any arrangements that are not accounted for or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
current outlook we believe that our markets continue to provide strong opportunities 
currently  we believe that premium rates in certain casualty reinsurance markets have strengthened to attractive levels 
we believe that premiums in our casualty segment will grow 
because there are areas of the casualty market where pricing remains inadequate  we are being selective and write business only when we believe it will be profitable 
we believe we have necessary expertise in our us operations to support our strategies 
we believe that our reputation for prompt service as well as our financial strength will help achieve our goal 
we believe that the additional capacity provided to the reinsurance market subsequent to september   as well as light catastrophe losses in and have begun to cause pricing in the property catastrophe market to decrease 
decreases to date have been modest and we believe that rates remain at attractive levels 
significant time and effort has been invested in developing sophisticated catastrophe modeling tools that assist us in identifying profitable business opportunities 
we believe we can improve the risk reward relationship in our portfolio and grow the property and marine segment while managing our catastrophe exposure risk within acceptable levels 
we believe that the finite risk segment has performed exceptionally well in profitability was favorably influenced by a relatively low level of current losses and contractual terms and conditions that provided for greater profit opportunity as a result of significant losses incurred in prior periods by st 
paul re 
we believe opportunities to write finite contracts will remain though the terms and conditions of the contracts will not allow the same profit opportunity as we move farther away from the adverse loss experience of st 
paul re 
we are routinely reviewing various opportunities for investments or transactions that would provide an attractive return on equity or an opportunity to write new classes of business or access additional markets 
risk factors numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements set forth in this form k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 
those factors include the following our results could be adversely affected by our status as a relatively new company 
the company has no operating history prior to the public offering 
businesses such as ours  which are in their early stages of development  present substantial business and financial risks 
we are still in the process of developing business relationships  establishing certain operating procedures  obtaining certain licenses and completing other tasks appropriate for the conduct of our business activities 
certain potential clients may not wish to do business with us because of our limited operating history 
increased competition could adversely affect our profitability 
the property and casualty reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with reinsurers worldwide  many of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than ours 
some of our competitors are large financial institutions that have reinsurance segments  while others are specialty reinsurance companies 
financial institutions have also created alternative capital market products that compete with reinsurance products  such as reinsurance securitization 
following the september  terrorist attack  a number of individuals and companies in the reinsurance industry established new  well capitalized  bermuda based reinsurers to benefit from improved market conditions  and a number of existing competitors raised additional capital or have announced plans to do so 
many of the reinsurers that entered the reinsurance markets have or could have more capital than we have 
in addition  there may be established companies or new companies of which we are not aware that may be planning to commit capital to this market 
the full effect of this additional capital on the reinsurance market and on the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts of the types we expect to underwrite may not be known for some time 
competition in the types of reinsurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors  including premium charges and other terms and conditions offered  services provided  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment  claims experience  perceived financial strength and experience and reputation of the reinsurer in the line of reinsurance to be underwritten 
traditional as well as new capital market participants from time to time produce alternative products such as reinsurance securitizations  catastrophe bonds and various derivatives such as swaps that may compete with certain types of reinsurance  such as property catastrophe 
over time  these numerous initiatives could significantly affect supply  pricing and competition in our industry 
a downgrade in the rating assigned by best s to our operating subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to write new business 
best s has assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent to our operating subsidiaries 
this is the third highest of sixteen rating levels 
according to best s  a rating of a indicates best s opinion that a company has an excellent ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
best s is generally considered to be a significant rating agency with respect to the evaluation of insurance and reinsurance companies 
ratings are used by ceding companies as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  a ceding company s own rating may be adversely affected by a downgrade in the rating of its reinsurer 
therefore  a downgrade of our rating may dissuade a ceding company from reinsuring with us and may influence a ceding company to reinsure with a competitor of ours that has a higher insurance rating 
it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain terms that would allow the ceding companies to cancel the contract if we are downgraded below our current rating level 
whether a client would exercise this cancellation right would depend  among other things  on the reason for such downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
it is impossible to predict in advance whether and how many of our clients would actually exercise this right or what effect such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations  but such effect could potentially be material 
the occurrence of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
because we underwrite property and casualty reinsurance and have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters  we expect that our loss experience generally will include infrequent events of great severity 
the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable 
consequently  the occurrence of losses from severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  catastrophes are an inherent risk of our business and a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to write new business  and our financial condition and results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity and statutory surplus which is the amount remaining after all liabilities  including liabilities for losses and lae  are subtracted from all admitted assets  as determined under statutory accounting principles  which are the principles prescribed or permitted by us insurance regulatory authorities 
increases in the values and geographic concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation have historically resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years and we expect that those factors will increase the severity of catastrophe losses in the future 
the failure to be effective of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our property and casualty reinsurance contracts cover unpredictable events such as hurricanes  windstorms  hailstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  fires  industrial explosions  freezes  riots  floods and other natural or man made disasters 
we seek to limit our overall exposure to risk by limiting the amount of reinsurance we write by geographic area  by peril and by type of program or contract 
our risk management uses a variety of means  including the use of contract terms  diversification criteria  probability analysis and analysis of comparable historical loss experience 
we estimate the impact of certain catastrophic events using catastrophe modeling software and contract information to evaluate our exposure to losses from individual contracts and in the aggregate 
for example  the majority of the natural catastrophe reinsurance we write relates to exposures within the united states  europe and japan 
accordingly  we monitor our exposure to events that affect these regions  such as hurricanes and earthquakes in the united states  windstorms in europe and typhoons and earthquakes in japan 
many of our reinsurance contracts do not contain an aggregate loss limit or a loss ratio limit  which means that there is no contractual limit to the losses that we may be required to pay pursuant to such reinsurance contracts 
substantially all of our property reinsurance contracts with natural catastrophe exposure have occurrence limits 
substantially all of our high layer property  casualty and marine excess of loss contracts also contain aggregate limits  with limited reinstatements of an occurrence limit  which restore the original limit under the contract after the limit has been depleted by losses incurred on that treaty 
various provisions of our contracts  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend  due to  among other things  disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity and statutory surplus 
if we are required to increase our liabilities for losses and lae  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and us gaap to establish liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for payment of losses and lae that will arise from our reinsurance products 
at any time  these liabilities may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and lae 
to the extent these liabilities may be insufficient to cover actual losses or lae  we will have to add to these liabilities and incur a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the liabilities established on our consolidated balance sheet do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but rather are estimates of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement of losses 
all of our liability estimates are based on actuarial and statistical projections at a given time  of facts and circumstances known at that time and estimates of trends in loss severity and other variable factors  including new concepts of liability and general economic conditions 
changes in these trends or other variable factors could result in claims in excess of the liabilities that we have established 
unforeseen losses  the type or magnitude of which we cannot predict  may emerge in the future 
these additional losses could arise from changes in the legal environment  catastrophic events  extraordinary events affecting our clients such as reorganizations and liquidations or changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  because we  like other reinsurers  do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded to us may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
under us gaap  platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda are not permitted to establish liabilities until an event occurs which may give rise to a loss 
once such an event occurs  liabilities are established based upon estimates of the total losses incurred by the ceding companies and an estimate of the portion of such loss our three operating subsidiaries have reinsured 
as a result  only liabilities applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be established  with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for expected future losses 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the loss is incurred and could be substantial 
we purchase retrocessional reinsurance  which may become unavailable on acceptable terms and which subjects us to credit risk 
in order to limit the effect on our financial condition of large and multiple losses  we buy retrocessional reinsurance  which is reinsurance for our own account 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance which they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result of the september  terrorist attack  both pricing and terms have become more severe in the retrocessional reinsurance market  which may limit our ability to obtain desired amounts of retrocessional reinsurance at acceptable pricing 
if we are unable to obtain retrocessional reinsurance  our financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
loss of all or portions of our retrocessional coverage could subject us to increased exposure  which could be material 
a retrocessionaire s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance treaty with us could have a material adverse effect on us 
therefore  our retrocessions subject us to credit risk because the ceding of risk to retrocessionaires does not relieve a reinsurer of its liability to the ceding companies 
we are dependent on the business provided to us by reinsurance brokers and we may be exposed to liability for brokers failure to make payments to clients for their claims 
we market most of our reinsurance products through reinsurance brokers 
the reinsurance brokerage industry generally  and our sources of business specifically  are concentrated 
the loss of business relationships with any of our top five brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  some of these brokers have invested in new bermuda reinsurance companies that may compete with us  and these brokers may favor their own reinsurers over other companies  including us 
in accordance with industry practice  we expect to frequently pay amounts owing in respect of claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  for payment over to the ceding companies 
in the event that a broker fails to make such a payment  depending on the jurisdiction  we may remain liable to the ceding company for the deficiency 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when premiums for such policies are paid to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us  such premiums will be deemed to have been paid and the ceding company will no longer be liable to us for those amounts whether or not actually received by us 
consequently  we will assume a degree of credit risk associated with our brokers during the payment process 
political and economic conditions may have an impact on our business 
the september  terrorist attack  threats of further terrorist attacks and the military initiatives and political unrest in afghanistan  iraq  the middle east and the surrounding regions have adversely affected general economic conditions  increasing many of the risks of our business 
this may have an enduring or increasingly adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
significant inflationary or recessionary periods can impact the company s underwriting operations and investment portfolio 
the property and casualty reinsurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable pricing 
historically  property and casualty reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect ceding companies decisions as to the amount or portion of risk that they retain for their own accounts and consequently reinsurance premium rates 
the supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry 
as a result  the property and casualty reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
we can expect to experience the effects of such cyclicality 
the cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including what management believes to be a trend of courts to grant increasingly larger awards for certain damages  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  tornadoes  earthquakes and floods  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of and income and returns on investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by primary insurers 
we cannot predict whether market conditions will improve  remain constant or deteriorate 
a return to unfavorable market conditions may affect our ability to write reinsurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed 
if we cannot write property and casualty reinsurance at appropriate rates  our ability to transact reinsurance business would be significantly and adversely affected 
our invested assets are subject to market volatility and interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuation 
the company s principal invested assets are fixed maturities  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
depending on the classification of our investments as available for sale  trading or other assets  changes in the market value of our securities will be reflected in either our consolidated balance sheet or statement of income 
the company s investment portfolio is also subject to credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the issuer s ability to repay the debt 
these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the company s principal exposure to foreign currency risk is its obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies 
the possibility exists that the company may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as it ultimately settles claims required to be paid in foreign currencies 
to the extent the company does not seek to hedge its foreign currency risk or hedges prove ineffective  the resulting impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rate could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
platinum holdings is a holding company and  consequently  its cash flow is dependent on dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries 
platinum holdings is a holding company that conducts no reinsurance operations of its own 
all operations are conducted by its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  platinum us  platinum uk and platinum bermuda 
as a holding company  platinum holdings cash flow consists primarily of dividends  interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries 
platinum holdings depends on such payments for general corporate purposes and to meet its obligations  including the payment of any dividends to its shareholders 
additionally  under the bermuda companies act  platinum holdings may declare or pay a dividend only if  among other things  it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due 
for a discussion of the legal limitations on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to platinum holdings  see business regulation 
the imposition of us corporate income tax on platinum holdings and its non us subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that platinum holdings  platinum uk  platinum bermuda and platinum ireland each operate in such a manner that none of these companies is subject to us corporate income tax because they are not engaged in a trade or business in the us nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the us is not provided by the tax authorities  the us internal revenue service might contend that any of these companies is engaged in a trade or business in the us  which would subject such company to us tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax on such income remaining after the regular tax in certain circumstances 
any such tax could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could significantly and adversely affect our business 
the business of reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers 
in bermuda  we operate under relatively less intensive regulatory requirements 
however in the united states and in the united kingdom licensed reinsurers are highly regulated and must comply with financial supervision standards comparable to those governing primary insurers 
for a detailed discussion of the regulatory requirements to which platinum holdings and its subsidiaries are subject  see business regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could materially adversely affect our financial results and operations 
in addition  these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to write new business or  as indicated above  distribute funds to platinum holdings 
in recent years  some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
moreover  the naic and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws  which may be more restrictive or may result in higher costs to us than current statutory requirements 
platinum bermuda is not registered or licensed as an insurance company in any jurisdiction outside bermuda 
platinum bermuda conducts its business through its offices in bermuda and does not maintain an office  and its personnel do not conduct any insurance activities  in the us or elsewhere 
although platinum bermuda does not believe it is in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to platinum bermuda s insurance activities may still be raised in the future 
the offshore insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including in the united states and in various states within the united states 
in the past  there have been congressional and other proposals in the united states regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry  including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the united states 
if platinum bermuda were to become subject to any insurance laws and regulations of the united states or any us state  which are generally more restrictive than those applicable to it in bermuda  at any time in the future  it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing specified types of policies or contracts 
complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on the ability of platinum bermuda to conduct its business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market and credit risk the company s principal invested assets are fixed maturities  which are subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices and credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the borrower s ability to meet its debt service obligations 
the company s strategy to limit this risk is to place its investments in high quality credit issues and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer or industry 
the company also selects investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of related estimated claim liabilities 
the company attempts to minimize the credit risk by actively monitoring the portfolio and requiring a minimum average credit rating of a as defined by moody s investor service 
as of december   the portfolio has a dollar weighted average rating of aa the company has other receivable amounts subject to credit risk 
the most significant of these are reinsurance premiums receivable from ceding companies and losses recoverable from retrocessionaires 
to mitigate credit risk related to losses recoverable from retrocessionaires  we establish business and financial standards for retrocessionaire approval  incorporate ratings by major rating agencies  consider current market information  and obtain letters of credit or other forms of security where deemed necessary 
to mitigate credit risk related to premium receivables  we have established standards for ceding companies and  in most cases  have a contractual right of offset thereby allowing the company to settle claims net of any premium receivable 
in accordance with industry practice  the company frequently pays amounts in respect of claims under contracts to reinsurance brokers  for payment over to the ceding companies 
in the event that a broker fails to make such a payment  depending on the jurisdiction  the company may remain liable to the ceding company for the payment 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when premiums for such contracts are paid to reinsurance brokers for payment over to the company  such premiums will be deemed to have been paid and the ceding company will no longer be liable to the company for those amounts whether or not actually received by the company 
consequently  the company assumes a degree of credit risk associated with its brokers during the payment process 
to mitigate credit risk related to reinsurance brokers  the company has established standards for brokers and intermediaries similar to those standards for ceding companies and reinsurers 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
movements in rates can result in changes in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can cause changes in the actual timing of when we expect to receive certain principal payments 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to extension risk 
conversely a decline in interest rates will result in a rise in the market value of our fixed income portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to prepayment risk 
the aggregate hypothetical impact on our fixed income portfolio  generated from an immediate parallel shift in the treasury yield curve  as of december  is approximately as follows in thousands interest rate shift in basis points bp bp current bp bp total market value      percent change in market value resulting unrealized appreciation depreciation 
     foreign currency risk the company writes business on a worldwide basis 
consequently  the company s principal exposure to foreign currency risk is its obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact revenues  costs  receivables and liabilities  as measured in the us dollar  our financial reporting currency 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure to its largest foreign currency risks by holding invested assets denominated in foreign currencies to offset liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
sources of fair value the following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments as of december  in thousands carrying amount fair value financial assets fixed maturities   other invested asset   financial liabilities debt obligations   the fair value of fixed maturities are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
the fair values of debt obligations are based on quoted market prices
