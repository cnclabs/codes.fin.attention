the combined effect of the above factors resulted in net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in trends the risk assessment services market continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on lower pricing for laboratory and paramedical services and expansion of services to compete with those offered by the company 
labone plans to maintain its focus on its long standing commitment to customer service  provision of quality products and services at competitive prices and development of innovative data management services and technological solutions that offer customers faster sources of reliable underwriting information and differentiate labone from its competitors 
the company anticipates that during the number of insurance applicants who undergo laboratory testing will remain relatively flat with and downward pressures on laboratory pricing will continue 
continued increases in the number and type of tests ordered per applicant tested are expected to continue  as is the willingness of life insurance companies to outsource other services such as case management and teleunderwriting 
the company should be uniquely positioned to capitalize on these anticipated trends 
during  labone continued to expand its customer base of national life insurance carriers using the company s teleunderwriting services 
under the terms of these contracts  labone personnel conduct telephone interviews relating to the medical histories of new life insurance policy applicants 
the company anticipates continued increases in revenues from these services during revenue from paramedical services increased million in  and the company anticipates that this growth trend will continue during although at a slower pace 
paramedical services historically return a lower gross margin than labone s other business segments 
in most cases  a substantial percentage of the revenue from a specimen collection is paid to a contractor who owns and operates an independent local office that arranges for the collection 
if this revenue grows as a percentage of total labone revenue  its lower gross margins will add to the total profitability of labone but will reduce the average gross profit percentage of revenue 
in clinical healthcare  the company serves approximately  managed care members under exclusive managed care outpatient laboratory service arrangements 
the company continues to add network approvals for healthcare plans in focused regional physician markets to increase penetration 
managed care organizations  and the physicians who are under their contracts  continue to choose labone for its quality controlled testing  disease management data capabilities and responsive customer service and support 
development of new clinical tests and proprietary methodologies for use by healthcare providers continues to expand 
recent discoveries or potential technology breakthroughs could enable rapid acceleration of this development and subsequent demand for these tests 
these tests are often characterized by higher processing costs or limited access through specific laboratories 
labone s response to this trend has been to internalize methodologies for these tests  thus lowering costs  and to seek adequate reimbursement for these tests from payors and clients 
the ability of outside firms to advance new tests and create demand for them  offset by the company s ability to successfully limit the expense impact of such tests and to be adequately reimbursed  may pressure clinical healthcare gross margins in the future 
alternatively  labone s responsive strategy may create advantages over smaller  less equipped competition 
labone continues development of methods to internalize testing formerly referenced to esoteric laboratories 
additionally  internal cytology and anatomic pathology capacity has been added  which will reduce labone s dependence on commercial providers for these services and reduce costs 
the integration of purchased laboratories  including central plains laboratories  the core laboratory operations of the health alliance and northwest toxicology  will increase testing volumes at the lenexa facility  improving capacity utilization and generating improved incremental margins on transferred testing 
the company continues to market the lab card program to physician practices and managed care companies 
membership in the lab card program is approximately million members 
liquidity and capital resources labone s working capital position increased to million as of december   from million as of december  this increase is primarily due to increased net income for the year 
accounts receivable grew to million as of december   from million as of december   due to the increase in revenue 
total cash and cash equivalents as of december   were million compared to million as of december  management expects to be able to fund operations from a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings

to finance the purchase of osborn in  labone issued million of convertible preferred stock   warrants to purchase labone stock at per share and million of subordinated debt to wcas 
the preferred stock earned a paid in kind dividend at a fixed rate of compounded semiannually and was converted into labone common stock at a rate of per share during the third and fourth quarters of the warrants were exercised in the million of subordinated debt bore a fixed interest rate of and was refinanced on december  from borrowings on the company s line of credit 
interest on the industrial revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of the company s lenexa facility is based on a taxable seven day variable rate which  including letter of credit and remarketing fees  was approximately as of february  the outstanding balance on the bonds was million as of december  and the bonds mature over the next six years in increments of million per year 
on june   the company entered into a million credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank administrative agent and collateral agent and wachovia bank  na syndication agent 
on december   the commitments under the credit agreement were increased to million 
the line of credit bears variable interest which  as of december   was and requires a commitment fee of on the unused portion of the commitment 
the line of credit is due on june  as of december   prior to the acquisitions of the core laboratory operations of the health alliance and of northwest toxicology  million was outstanding under the agreement and approximately million of the remaining million was available for borrowing 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company must comply with certain financial covenants 
a leverage covenant requires that the ratio of total indebtedness to the sum of four rolling quarters of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined  be less than times 
an interest coverage covenant requires that the ratio of the sum of four rolling quarters of ebitda be at least times the net interest expense  as defined  for those quarters 
other covenants limit annual cash capital expenditures to thirty percent of ebitda and require the maintenance of a certain level of consolidated net worth 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to the line of credit

sfas no 
establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope

for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for the company on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
the company currently does not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of sfas no 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition while many operational aspects are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for labone s business is generally straightforward 
the company recognizes revenues for its services when those services are provided to the customer 
revenues related to clinical healthcare billings include adjustments for revenue disallowances estimated at the time the revenue is recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves a standardized monthly review of the collectibility of receivables based on contractual obligations and the aging of accounts receivable 
contractual agreements  historical collection patterns and payor reimbursement experience are integral in the estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  the current state of billing functions is assessed in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
adjustments to the reserve for contractual agreements are reported as a reduction in revenues 
other adjustments are recorded to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expenses 
the collection and reserves processes  along with the monitoring of billing processes  helps to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and bill ing functions 
software developed for internal use certain internal and external costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
these capitalized costs are included in property  plant and equipment and are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives beginning when the software project is put in service 
the company periodically reviews the lives and values of its capitalized software and makes adjustments if necessary 
goodwill and intangible assets the company allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
a portion of the purchase price is assigned to each individual asset acquired on the basis of its fair value 
intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights 
if intangible assets do not arise from contractual or other legal rights  they are recognized as assets apart from goodwill only if they are capable of being separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill have a determinable life and are amortized accordingly 
the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to the tangible assets and any separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the company evaluates the recoverability and measures the potential impairment of goodwill under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units to determine if any impairment exists 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company  as well as the financial projections and future prospects of business  including growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and comparable sales prices  if available 
to assess potential impairment  the estimate of fair value for the company is compared to the book value of the consolidated net assets 
if the book value of the consolidated net assets is greater than the estimate of fair value  the company then proceeds to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the impli ed fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
the company believes its estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
factors affecting the company s future performance investing in shares of labone common stock involves a risk of loss 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents the company files with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other public statements made by the company 
if the company cannot effectively implement its growth strategy  it would materially affect business and results of operations 
labone s growth strategy assumes the company will acquire additional risk assessment  laboratory testing or other related businesses and enter into new strategic alliances 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to continue to identify risk assessment  laboratory testing or other related service companies to acquire or enter into alliances with or otherwise negotiate acceptable terms with respect to any transaction 
furthermore  the company may have difficulty integrating an acquired business with existing operations  retaining key customers or vendors or retaining key personnel of the acquired business 
the acquisition and integration of an acquired business requires the dedication of significant management resources that could adversely affect business activities or customer service 
in addition  the issuance of equity securities pursuant to these acquisitions or allian ces could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
labone derives a significant portion of revenue from risk assessment and laboratory testing services contracts  many of which are terminable at will or on short notice by customers 
other contracts are terminable or subject to significant penalties if performance standards are not met 
competition  interruption or deterioration in services or a change in management or ownership of a customer could result in a customer s decision to stop using labone s services in whole or in part 
lower prices offered by competitors may undercut labone s competitive advantage and reduce profits 
the company has competed in the life insurance risk assessment business by offering a more complete suite of higher quality services than its competitors at competitive prices 
some competitors are offering lower prices 
if these competitors continue to reduce prices and customers refuse to pay higher prices for labone s services  profits may be reduced 
competition from other providers of risk assessment  laboratory testing or other related services may materially harm labone s business and results of operations 
labone has numerous competitors  including two larger national laboratory companies with significantly greater financial and technical resources 
these national laboratory companies also have national and regional contracts with managed care networks  some on an exclusive basis  and they also have exclusive arrangements for the distribution of certain esoteric tests applicable to the clinical market 
the strategies and other efforts of the company s competitors  if successful  may erode the company s customer base  limit the company s access to users and payors of laboratory services  reduce the company s existing and future sources of revenue and access to local and regional markets  and cause the company to reduce prices or increase its marketing and other costs of doing business  each of which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
any adverse change in the number and types of tests ordered by life insurance companies could reduce profits 
currently  the largest and most profitable business segment for labone is providing risk assessment services to the life insurance industry 
the level of demand for such services is influenced by a number of factors  including o the number of life insurance applications underwritten  o the policy amount thresholds at which insurance companies order testing and other services  o the type and costs of tests and other services requested  o testing and specimen collection innovations approved by the food and drug administration  and o the extent to which insurance companies may create in house testing facilities and provide other underwriting services in house 
these factors are beyond the company s control 
any adverse changes in life insurance industry demand for testing and other services the company provides could significantly reduce profits 
efforts by managed care organizations  medicare  medicaid  insurance companies and other payors to reduce the cost and utilization of healthcare services  including laboratory testing services  could reduce the prices for laboratory testing services and harm the results of clinical laboratory operations 
impairment of goodwill on labone s books could depress the stock price 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill  including million from the merger of labone  inc and lab holdings  inc 
in  recorded on its balance sheet 
if this goodwill is impaired in the future  the company will be required to take a non cash charge to earnings 
this could depress the market price of labone stock if the stock price is influenced by investors that focus primarily on net earnings rather than on other financial measures 
the failure to provide accurate laboratory test results and other data or follow accepted procedures may result in claims that may not be covered by insurance 
clients rely on the accuracy of testing and other services to make significant insurance  treatment and employment decisions 
in addition  federal and state laws regulate the disclosure of specimen testing results and other nonpublic personal information 
if labone does not provide accurate test results using accepted scientific methods  does not provide other data accurately  or does not adequately protect the confidentiality and security of this information  the company could incur significant liability 
the company has insurance to cover these types of claims  but cannot assure that this coverage is adequate or will continue to be available at reasonable prices 
business could be harmed by disruption in express delivery service 
labone generally relies on express couriers to transport specimens to its laboratories quickly and safely 
a disruption in these couriers businesses resulting from a labor dispute  natural disaster  malicious human acts or other event could harm business and results of operations 
the development of more attractive on site rapid assay tests may reduce demand for laboratory testing services 
labone serves customers through laboratory based testing facilities 
although there are some on site rapid assay testing products available in the marketplace  rapid assays have not achieved broad market acceptance due to the high cost of such assays  liability concerns  regulatory limitations  less accurate testing results and the absence of a broad testing menu 
if more competitive assays become available  such products could be substituted for laboratory based testing and have an adverse impact on business and results of operations 
business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the company s primary testing facility is temporarily shut down or severely damaged because of a natural disaster  telecommunications failure or other serious event 
the company carries business interruption insurance to compensate for losses which might occur  but it cannot provide assurance that this insurance coverage will be enough to compensate for damages resulting from any such disruption to business 
labone s organizational documents and other agreements contain restrictions that might prevent a takeover or change in management 
provisions of the articles of incorporation and by laws might have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting a takeover on terms that some shareholders might favor  reducing the opportunity for shareholders to sell shares at a premium over then prevailing market prices and preventing or frustrating attempts to replace or remove current management 
these provisions include o a fair price provision  o a requirement that the board of directors be classified  o the authorization of a blank check preferred stock to be issued at the discretion of the board of directors  and o a requirement that the company receive advance notice of shareholder nominees for director and shareholder proposals 
in addition  the company has a shareholder rights plan  which grants shareholders other than the acquiring person the right to purchase common stock at one half of market price if any person becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the outstanding shares of common stock  subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure exists due to labone s variable interest rates associated with its liability of million borrowing on its line of credit and million in industrial revenue bonds as of december  the interest expense on the line of credit is based on the libor rate plus a range of to basis points and is approximately as of february  the interest expense incurred on the bonds is based on a taxable seven day variable rate which  including letter of credit and remarketing fees  is approximately as of february  any future increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense which could be material 
based on balances outstanding as of december   an assumed increase in interest rates representing approximately basis points would potentially increase interest expense on these instruments by million annually
