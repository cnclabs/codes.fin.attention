critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  investments  restructuring costs and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues consist of fixed monthly fees and usage fees generally based on per minute or transaction rates 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue which results from the weekly billing cycle that was implemented at the premiere conferencing operating segment during the third quarter of deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
the company s revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and b 

table of contents should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
prior to the recognition of revenue  the company makes a decision that collectibility is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in the company s customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
the company evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this pronouncement became effective in the company recognizes an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the estimated future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
prior to  when the company determined that the carrying value of long lived assets  intangibles and related goodwill may not have been recoverable in accordance with the indicators of impairment  as stated in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of the company recognized an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flow was less than the carrying value of such assets 
the impairment loss  if applicable  was calculated based on the fair value or sum of the discounted cash flows compared to the carrying value 
the discounted cash flow method uses a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s business model 
see asset impairments for a discussion of impairments recorded during and net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents future events could cause the company to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its taxes in each of the jurisdictions of operation 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  and was million and million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company has recorded the valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company also records a provision for certain international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation  when needed 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to challenges from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business other changing facts and circumstances may impact the company s ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
management believes it has appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if the company is required to pay an amount less than or exceeding its provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations 
investments 
the company has historically made investments in various companies that are engaged in emerging technologies related to the internet 
either the cost or equity method is used to account for these investments in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
in addition  the company has investments in equity securities of companies with readily determinable fair values accounted for in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas no 
mandates that a determination be made of the appropriate classification for equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and all debt securities at the time of purchase and re evaluation of such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
see the asset impairments and obligations investments section of management s discussion and analysis above for a discussion of investment impairments recorded during total investments  in the form of marketable securities available for sale  as of december  and were million 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
restructuring costs 
the restructuring accruals are based on certain estimates and judgments related to contractual obligations and related costs 
the restructuring accruals related to contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the company s ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 

table of contents in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in item legal proceedings  of this report 
management has accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  although no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s estimates and judgments or accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
these estimates are subject to change and the company adjusts the financial impact in the period in which they are resolved

table of contents risk factors affecting future performance risks relating to our industry the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors which may make it difficult to maintain or increase our market share and revenues 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
for information regarding the markets in which each of our business units compete  see the section entitled business competition 
many of our current and potential competitors  such as major telecommunications service providers  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more robust product offerings  more comprehensive support organizations  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their product and service offerings and new competitors are likely to enter our markets 
acquisitions or strategic alliances  including those among existing and new competitors or their attempts to integrate their products and services  may result in greater competition 
for example  several independent conferencing companies have recently been acquired by larger companies  including the acquisitions of intercall and conferencecall 
com by west corporation and the acquisition of placeware  inc by microsoft corp 
and subsequent integration of placeware s services into microsoft office system 
increased competition could result in price pressure on our products and services and a decrease in our market share in the various markets in which we compete  either of which could hinder our ability to grow our revenues 
technological changes and the development of alternatives to our products and services may cause us to lose customers and market share and may hinder our ability to maintain or grow our revenues 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced that will compete with our products and services 
technological advances may result in the development and commercial availability of alternatives to or new methods of delivering  our products and services and pricing options that could be more attractive to our customers 
these developments could cause our existing products and services to become obsolete  result in significant pricing pressure on our products and services or allow our existing and potential customers to meet their own telecommunications needs without using our services 
for example  if customers more rapidly adopt internet protocol ip based conferencing services or ip based pbx systems  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and any of these developments could result in significant customer loss 
we must continually introduce new products and services in response to technological changes  evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to our existing products and services 
for example  in response to evolving industry standards  we recently released faxmail  securemail and enhancements to our messagereach  voicereach and premierecall auditorium services  but these products and services may not be as successful as those of our competitors 
we will not be able to gain market share and increase our revenues if we are unable to develop new products and services  or if we experience delays in the introduction of new products and services 
our ability to successfully develop and market new products and services and enhancements that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or customer demands  is dependent on our ability to foresee changes in industry standards  anticipate and apply advances in technologies  enhance our software  applications  equipment  systems and networks  and attract and retain qualified and creative technical personnel 

table of contents we are subject to pricing pressures for our products and services which could cause us to lose market share and decrease revenues and profitability 
we compete for customers based on several factors  including price 
a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by our competitors could cause us to reduce the rates we charge for our products and services 
if we cannot compete based on price  we may lose market share 
if we reduce our rates without increasing our volume or our market share  our revenues could decrease 
for example  in and  increased competition and decreased demand for xpedite s traditional or legacy store and forward fax business resulted in a decrease in xpedite revenue 
further  if we reduce our rates and our costs of providing our products and services do not decrease proportionately  or if they increase  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
continuing softness in the economy has resulted  and may continue to result  in adverse effects on the telecommunications industry 
the downturn in general economic conditions  including the telecommunications services industry  has forced several of our customers and suppliers  including mci and global crossing  to file for protection from creditors under the united states bankruptcy code or to reconfigure their capital structure 
some of these companies had significant debt servicing requirements and were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to both service their debt and to maintain their business operations 
we cannot assure you that our customers or suppliers will remain financially viable  or that the measures we follow will be effective 
if general economic conditions in the united states remain at current levels for an extended period of time or worsen  our business could be adversely affected 
risks relating to our business our future success depends on market acceptance of our new products and services 
market acceptance of our new products and services often requires that individuals and enterprises accept new ways of communicating and exchanging information 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  our new products and services could hinder our ability to maintain and increase our revenues 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our new products and services will depend on several factors  including ease of use  price  reliability  accessibility to our services  quality of service  system security  product functionality  and the effectiveness of our strategic marketing and sales efforts and distribution relationships 
if we do not meet these challenges  our new products and services may not achieve broad market acceptance or market acceptance may not occur quickly enough to justify our investment in these products and services 

table of contents concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may have an adverse impact on the market acceptance of our web enabled products and services 
the concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet may prevent many potential customers from using internet related products and services 
if our web enabled products and services do not include sufficient security features  our web enabled products and services may not gain market acceptance  or we may experience legal exposure 
despite the measures we have taken  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person circumvents our security measures  he or she could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruption in our operations 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may be required to make significant investments in efforts to protect against and remedy these types of security breaches 
additionally  as electronic commerce becomes more widespread  our customers will become more concerned about security 
if we are unable to adequately address these concerns  we may be unable to sell our web enabled products and services 
if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price may decrease 
our quarterly revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenues 
if our revenue levels are below expectations  we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately  and our operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include the unique nature of strategic relationships into which we may enter in the future  the financial performance of our strategic partners  fluctuations in operating expenses  the reliability and performance of our products and services  the timing of new product and service announcements  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  changes in legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our products and services  and general economic and seasonal factors 
increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt  million of which related to our convertible notes due and million of which related to our convertible notes due we have significant interest payment obligations as a result of our existing convertible notes  which totalled million for the year ending december  on november   we entered into a three year million revolving credit facility with lasalle bank national association  as agent 
as of december   we have million in borrowings and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of any interest or amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness  
table of contents increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  and depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes may be limited 
if we cannot service our indebtedness through normal business operations  we may need to explore strategic alternatives 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  to sell selected assets  or to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations 
we conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our cash obligations in the future will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions to us 
the ability of our subsidiaries to make these distributions is and will continue to be restricted by  among other limitations  applicable provisions of governing law and contractual provisions 
our right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary and thus the ability of our debt holders and our shareholders to benefit indirectly from such assets is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors  including trade creditors  of that subsidiary except to the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be subject to any security interest of other creditors of such subsidiary 
one of our customers accounts for a significant amount of revenues  and any loss of business from that customer may hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
one of premiere conferencing s customers  ibm  accounts for a significant amount of revenue 
of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations  sales to ibm accounted for approximately in  in and in of premiere conferencing segment revenue from continuing operations  sales to ibm accounted for approximately in  in and in premiere conferencing segment with ibm may not continue at historical levels  and there is no long term price protection for services provided to ibm 
a loss in revenues from ibm or diminution in the relationship with ibm  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we do not attract and retain highly qualified and creative technical and support personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
we believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified and creative engineering  product development and customer support personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified and creative personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled technical employees with appropriate qualifications 
we may not be able to retain our key technical employees and we may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
if we are not able to locate  hire and retain qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our business may suffer if we do not retain the services of our chief executive officer 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the familiarity of mr 
jones with the markets in which we compete and emerging technologies  such as the internet  makes him critical to our success 
we maintained key man life insurance on mr 
jones in the amount of million  which terminated on december  if we cannot successfully integrate new technologies  products  services and systems  we may not generate sufficient revenues and operational synergies may not develop 
we continuously integrate new technologies  products  service offerings and systems 
we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty integrating new technologies into our networks 
for example  conversion issues in the integration of voice over ip voip delivery into our faxmail service caused a delay in the general availability release of this service 
in addition  we experienced system integration issues resulting in higher than normal telecommunications costs and some service outages associated with the transitioning of services off the c w network following the c w acquisition in january if we cannot successfully integrate new technologies  products  services and systems  we may not generate sufficient revenues and operational synergies may not develop 
downtime in our network infrastructure could result in the loss of significant customers 
we currently maintain facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls and computer telephony equipment in locations throughout the world 
the delivery of our products and services is dependent  in part  upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future 
for example  we have suffered and may continue to suffer service interruptions when certain of our telecommunications service providers connections drop 
in addition  we experienced downtime in our services as a result of the blaster worm virus in august and some service outages in the transitioning of services off the c w network following the c w acquisition 
these types of service interruptions could result in the loss of significant customers  which could cause us to lose revenues 
we take substantial precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware  fire protection systems and other contingency plans 
in addition  some of our networks are designed so that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
we also maintain business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year 
however  we may not be able to maintain insurance for this risk in the future  or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices 
even if we maintain insurance for this risk  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 

table of contents if we fail to predict growth in our network usage and add needed capacity  the quality of our service offerings may suffer 
as network usage grows  we will need to add capacity to our hardware  software and facilities with telecommunications equipment that route telephone calls 
this means that we continuously attempt to predict growth in our network usage and add capacity accordingly 
if we do not accurately predict and efficiently manage growth in our network usage  the quality of our service offerings may suffer and we may lose customers 
our inability to efficiently utilize or renegotiate minimum purchase requirements in our long distance telecommunications supply agreements could decrease our profitability 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms from telecommunications service providers 
contracts with some of our telecommunications service providers contain minimum purchase requirements through in addition  certain circuits that we purchase are subject to term requirements  including penalties for early termination of such circuits 
the total amount of the minimum purchase requirements in was approximately million  and we incurred metered telecommunications costs in excess of these minimums 
it is possible that other suppliers may provide similar services at lower prices and we may not be able to renegotiate our current supply agreements to achieve comparable lower rates 
further  we can give no assurance that we will be able to utilize the minimum amount of services that we are required to purchase under these agreements 
if we are unable to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms  or if we are required to purchase more services than we are able to utilize in running our business  the costs of providing our services would likely increase  which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
software failures or errors may result in failure of our platforms and or networks  which could result in increased costs and lead to interruptions in our services and losses of significant customers and revenues 
the software that we have developed and utilize in providing our products and services may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or other equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenues because of the inability of customers to use our networks or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  we may not be able to maintain insurance for this risk in the future  or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices 
even if we maintain insurance for this risk  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
interruption in long distance telecommunications services could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenues 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms from long distance telecommunications service providers 
we do not own a transmission network 
as a result  we depend on mci  at t  sprint and other providers for transmission of our customers long distance telecommunications services 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured under supply agreements with multi year terms  some of which are subject to various early termination penalties and minimum purchase requirements 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of long distance telecommunications services  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
the partial or total loss of our ability to receive or terminate telephone calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenues 
we depend on local phone companies that provide local transmission services  known as local exchange carriers  for call origination and termination 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls could 
table of contents result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenues 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at originating or terminating carriers  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
if the delivery of our e mail messages is limited or blocked  demand for our services may decline 
we depend on our ability to deliver e mails over the internet through internet service providers and private networks 
internet service providers are able to block messages from reaching their users and we do not have  nor are we required to have  agreements with any internet service providers to deliver e mails to their customers 
as a result  we could experience periodic temporary blockages of our delivery of e mails to their customers  which would limit the effectiveness of our e mail marketing 
some internet service providers also use proprietary technologies to handle and deliver e mail 
if internet service providers materially limit or block the delivery of our e mails  or if our technology fails to be compatible with these internet service providers e mail technologies  then our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the effectiveness of e mail marketing may decrease as a result of increased consumer resistance to e mail marketing in general 
our inability to resolve pending billing disputes with mci could result in significant costs or service disruptions 
we purchase telecommunications and other network services from mci under numerous transmission agreements 
currently  we have several significant outstanding disputes with mci regarding the charges billed by mci under those agreements 
we have asserted that mci and its affiliates owe us credits exceeding million 
mci  in turn  has disputed a portion of those credits claimed by us 
if we are unable to resolve our billing dispute with mci or are required to pay mci an amount greater than is accrued  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
on october   mci filed a supplement to its second amended joint plan of reorganization  or plan  under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the plan supplement provides that the settlement agreement and mutual release between us and mci  dated april   is added to the list of executory contracts that mci intends to reject pursuant to the terms of the plan and the bankruptcy code 
as a party to a rejected executory contract  we may be entitled to damages from mci for  among other things  breach of contract  however  such a claim  if allowed  would likely be treated as a general unsecured claim under the plan 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to resolve our billing disputes with mci or that we will be successful in asserting any rights of set off against amounts due to us from mci 
if we are unable to resolve our billing dispute with mci or if the date for the rejection of our existing telecommunication service agreements is effective prior to renegotiation of these agreements with mci or migration of traffic to an alternate provider  we could experience increased costs and or interruptions in service  which could adversely affect our customer relationships  customer retention and results of operations 
technological obsolescence of our equipment could result in substantial capital expenditures 
technological advances may result in the development of new equipment and changing industry standards  which could cause our equipment to become obsolete 
these events could require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our equipment 
for example  we are currently in the process of introducing ip based equipment into our bridges and may need to increase our number of ports if adoption of voip is more rapid than expected 
our financial performance could cause future write downs of goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and are required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
the review in resulted in an impairment of certain other intangible assets at xpedite of approximately million 
subsequent reviews could result in impairment write downs to goodwill and or other intangible assets 
as of december   we had million of other intangible assets reflected on our financial statements for which amortization will continue 

table of contents we could be required to make payments in the future in connection with the sale of our voicecom business unit 
in connection with the sale of our voicecom business unit in march  we agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to our operation of the unit prior to the closing of the transaction  including liabilities for certain taxes  contingent liabilities  litigation claims  and unknown liabilities 
as a result  we could incur a liability in the future related to these retained liabilities 
in addition  pursuant to the transaction  the buyer assumed or subleased substantially all of the real estate utilized in our voicecom business unit 
the buyer also committed to buy certain telecommunications and other services and to manage and utilize certain regulated and other assets held by our voicecom operating subsidiaries 
as of december   voicecom owes one of our affiliates approximately million for telecommunication services 
an affiliate of the buyer guaranteed the timely payment of a substantial portion of these voicecom liabilities 
of the voicecom liabilities  approximately million as of december  represents capital leases guaranteed by us 
accordingly  in the event the buyer or buyer s affiliate fails to make payments as required  we could be required to make significant payments in the future 
our pending shareholder litigation in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia could be costly  time consuming and a diversion to management and  if adversely determined  could result in substantial liabilities 
a lawsuit was filed on november  against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the southern district of new york 
for a description of this shareholder litigation  please see part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
regardless of the ultimate outcome  this matter could be costly  time consuming and a diversion to management and other resources 
if the outcome of this matter is adverse to us  it could result in substantial damages 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law may inhibit a takeover which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation  which we refer to as our articles  and our amended and restated bylaws  which we refer to as our bylaws  and georgia corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our shareholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of ptek by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of ptek because our shareholders elect only one third of the members of the board of directors each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the georgia business corporation code that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 
in addition to considering the effects of any action on us and our shareholders  our articles permit our board of directors and the committees and individual members of the board to consider the interests of various constituencies  including employees  customers  suppliers  and creditors  communities in which we maintain offices or operations  and other factors which they deem pertinent  in carrying out and discharging their duties and responsibilities and in determining what is believed to be in our best interests 
our rights plan may also inhibit a takeover which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
on june   our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series c junior participating preferred stock at a price of sixty dollars per one thousandth of a share of series c junior participating preferred stock  subject to adjustment 
the rights may have anti takeover effects because they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
however  the rights should not interfere with any merger  statutory share exchange or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights may be terminated by the board of directors at any time on or prior to the close of business ten business days after announcement by us that a person has become an acquiring person 
the rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of us to initiate an acquisition through negotiations with the board of directors 
however  the effect of the rights may be to discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial equity position in our equity securities  or seeking to obtain control of us 

table of contents risks related to possible future acquisitions we may decide to pursue future acquisitions  and we may face risks in acquiring and integrating other businesses  products and technologies 
we may decide to pursue future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that we believe will complement our business 
as a result  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources  and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to us and our investors  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  assumption of known and unknown liabilities  and adverse financial impact from the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
for example  we experienced higher than normal telecommunication costs associated with xpedite s c w acquisition in january and the transitioning of services off of the c w network 
we also recently entered into the financial supply chain management services market with xpedite s acquisition of linkata technologies in april if we fail to adequately manage these acquisition risks  the acquisition may not result in revenue growth  operational synergies or product and service enhancements  which could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
risks related to intellectual property we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology  brand and marks 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary rights and technology  we could lose those rights and incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights 
our proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets that we attempt to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in our licensing  services  reseller and other agreements 
we typically attempt to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
our means of protecting our intellectual property  proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  some of our systems  such as those used in our document distribution business are not proprietary and  as a result  this information may be acquired or duplicated by existing and potential competitors 

table of contents if claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and successfully prosecuted against us  they could result in substantial costs 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information services  telecommunications  computer telephony and the internet 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of our business  we have been and expect to continue to be  subject to third party claims that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
if these types of claims are brought  we ultimately may not prevail and any claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of these types of claims 
any infringement claim  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and a diversion to management  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new products and services or enhancements  or result in costly royalty or licensing agreements 
we have received letters from ronald a 
katz technology licensing  lp  informing us of the existence of its respective patents and the potential applicability of those patents on our products and services 
we are currently considering this matter 
certain of our former voicecom customers have alleged that we are obligated to indemnify them against patent infringement claims made by katz against such customers 
we do not believe that we have an obligation to indemnify such customers 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we are unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation as a result of any of these claims  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to government regulation recent regulatory changes may discourage certain customers from using our fax  e mail and voice messaging services and could adversely impact our results of operations 
recent legislative and regulatory changes have imposed additional restrictions that may impact our business 
such changes include the passage of federal legislation to curb unsolicited commercial e mail  or spam  and additional restrictions on telemarketing and advertising via facsimile 
xpedite provides services to customers engaged in fax and e mail communications and telemarketing 
in addition  the telephone consumer protection act of and associated rules promulgated by the federal communications commission prohibit the sending of unsolicited advertisements via facsimiles  and proscribe certain telemarketing practices 
other recent federal laws are being implemented by the federal trade commission that also substantially regulate telemarketing 
compliance with the new legislation and regulations could have an adverse impact on the volume of fax  e mail and voice messages sent utilizing xpedite s platforms and amount of revenue generated by xpedite in the united states 
in addition  the company could be subject to litigation concerning its compliance with these new laws and regulations 
government regulations in the united states and internationally and the legal uncertainties related to the internet and electronic communications may adversely affect the demand for our services and place financial burdens on our business related to compliance 
currently  there are few laws or regulations directed specifically at electronic commerce and the internet 
however  because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and internationally 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as collection and use of data from internet website visitors  privacy  e mail  network and information security  spamming  pricing  content  copyrights and other intellectual property  the transmission of voice over the internet  changes in telecommunications regulations  online gambling  distribution and quality of goods and services 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet  which could impede the growth of our web enabled products and services and place additional financial burdens on our business in order to comply with new laws and regulations 
laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce or internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
for example  the united states congress has enacted laws regarding on line copyright infringement and the protection of information collected on line from children 
although these laws may not have a direct adverse effect on our business  they add to the legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the internet and possible future costs of regulatory compliance 
congress also recently enacted legislation to regulate unsolicited commercial e mail  or spam 
certain provisions of the legislation remain to be implemented by federal agencies  including the federal trade commission and the federal communications commission 

table of contents our operations are  and may be subject to laws and regulations in the united states and internationally regulating the unsolicited transmission of facsimile communications and e mail 
we monitor such laws and regulations  and our service agreements with customers state that customers are responsible for their compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
we could  nevertheless  be subject to litigation  fines  losses or other penalties under such laws and regulations 
we may become subject to various government regulations related to traditional telephone service providers  which could impair our ability to deliver our products and services 
our business is affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by federal  state  local and international telecommunications regulatory agencies 
those authorities may seek to regulate  or to impose requirements applicable to traditional telephone companies upon our services 
we use reasonable efforts to ensure that our operations comply with applicable regulatory requirements
