geographic presence 
we sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force and through relationships with indirect channel partners  including value added resellers and technology solution providers 
we have established direct sales and service operations for north america  with offices throughout the united states and in canada  for europe  with headquarters in maidenhead  england and for australia  based in sydney 
in addition  we have value added resellers throughout north america  europe  the middle east  africa  asia  brazil  and central america 
revenues from sales outside of the united 
table of contents states were   and  or  and of total revenues  respectively for  and  respectively 
since  we have invested in the infrastructure necessary to expand our global operations  including the formation and staffing of our european  asian and australian operations 
we expect to continue to invest in our international operations as we expand our international indirect channels and our asp service operations abroad to increase worldwide market share 
while weak global economic conditions for enterprise software negatively affected our international revenues in and  we anticipate that  because of our continued investments in this area  revenues derived from outside the united states will increase both in terms of percentage of revenues and absolute dollars in the future 
strategic intent 
our strategy is to become the leading provider of open and extensible application software  services and solutions for online business communications and collaboration 
in our effort to achieve this market position  we have undertaken several key business and operational initiatives with the intent of generating profitable revenue growth through the deliverance of exceptional products  solutions and services 
we intend to invest in the areas of sales and marketing by increasing the size of our direct and indirect sales organizations  increasing our lead generation programs  including advertising and other marketing activities to penetrate new and expand existing accounts at the department or division level of the global  government agencies and higher education organizations  focusing our direct field sales force on selling at the executive level of strategic accounts within our existing customer base and realigning our inside sales representatives to team with our direct field sales representatives in north america to provide an additional layer of support in the field to increase sales productivity 
during  we expect to increase spending in sales and marketing by million over levels  aimed at enhancing brand recognition and increasing revenues 
in all other areas of the business  including product development  general and administrative  and customer support  we expect to maintain or increase slightly our level of expenditures in to execute our business plan  to expand our ecosystem of alliance and channel partners and to further develop and improve upon our products and services to address the real time enterprise conferencing and collaboration market 
see liquidity and capital resources and factors that may affect future results we may not successfully execute our strategic plan despite our significant planned investments 
challenges in the marketplace 
the market for real time enterprise conferencing and collaboration is both evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
additionally  the purchasing behavior of our customers is influenced  in large part  by the macroeconomic environment as well as their corporate financial condition 
these two factors combined or in isolation present formidable challenges in the marketplace as we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of such external situations 
as we proceed through the next few quarters  we do expect to see positive results from an increase in our direct sales force  the re alignment of our inside sales team  and from our incremental investments in lead generation programs 
however  while we have done extensive market research  we cannot be entirely assured of the resulting success of these investments 
our goals of achieving revenue growth and establishing a market leading position are dependent upon various factors including macroeconomic conditions  corporate it needs and spending capacity  successful packaging and presentation of our products  efficient and effective execution of our sales strategy and competitive entrants and marketplace actions 
for a more comprehensive analysis of risk factors  see factors that could affect future results below 
on april   we acquired mindlever 
com  inc  a north carolina corporation and a provider of management systems for learning content  for million in cash and  shares of common stock valued 
table of contents at approximately million  plus acquisition costs of approximately  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition  mindlever became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of mindlever have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
when we acquired mindlever  we recorded a goodwill asset on our balance sheet in the amount of million 
during the quarter ended december   however  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the remaining goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 
our revenues are classified into three main categories license  software services and maintenance and professional services 
license revenue is generated from the sale of packaged software applications on either a perpetual license or time based license basis 
software services revenue is comprised of revenues from our asp service sold on a subscription or per use basis and from hosted services 
maintenance and professional services revenue includes revenue from maintenance and support contracts and from consulting and education services 
our cost of license revenues includes royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  as well as the cost of product documentation  media used to deliver our products  and fulfillment 
amortization of acquired developed technology represents the amortization  over a three year period  of the valuation of the developed technology and know how acquired in connection with our april acquisition of mindlever 
our cost of software service revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our hosted and asp services organizations  an overhead allocation consisting primarily of that portion of our facilities  communications and depreciation expenses that is attributable to providing our services  and direct costs related to our hosted and asp service offerings 
our cost of professional services and maintenance revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education and technical support services organizations and an overhead allocation consisting primarily of that portion of our facilities  communications and depreciation expenses that is attributable to providing our services 
our operating expenses are classified into seven general categories sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  compensation charge for issuance of stock options  impairment of goodwill  merger transaction costs and restructuring and severance charges 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing programs  including trade shows  user group meetings and seminars  advertising  public relations activities and new product launches 
product development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  fees for outside consultants and other related costs associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  amortization of costs of third party source code purchased  costs associated with quality assurance  testing and documentation and third party product localization costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  financial  administrative and information technology personnel  as well as costs for auditing and accounting  legal  investor relations  liability insurance and other expenses associated with being a public company 
compensation charge for issuance of stock options represents the amortization  over the vesting period  of the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees in and and the deemed fair market value of these options at the time they were granted for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  our compensation charge for issuance of stock options represents a charge in the third quarter of of approximately  for the acceleration of vesting and extension of the time period to exercise certain stock options under the terms of a severance agreement with our former president and chief operating officer 
impairment of goodwill represents the write down of the remaining goodwill related to the mindlever transaction to its implied fair value of zero 

table of contents merger transaction costs represent legal and investment advisor costs that were incurred related to the proposed merger between centra and smartforce plc 
the proposed merger was terminated as of april  restructuring and severance charges represent charges incurred related to the departure of various members of our executive team during  and a reduction in the company s workforce in april in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  our software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant and all costs related to internal product development have been expensed as incurred 
we have experienced substantial losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and our accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development  marketing  sale and delivery of our products and services  including the establishment of our hosted and asp services infrastructure  which have been only partially offset by our revenues to date 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth in and we have achieved a substantial decrease in our net loss for over  we may not be able to continue to increase our revenues or attain profitability and  if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain profitability for any future periods 
we plan to spend an additional million for sales and marketing in over our expenditure rate and as a result we expect to incur additional losses during however  we plan for our operations to become profitable by the end of to accomplish this goal we will need to generate a significant increase in revenues in over we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future financial performance 
see factors that could affect future results  in item critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable valuation and reserves  the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and accounting for income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments revenue recognition the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations and the time at which revenue is recognized determines the timing of certain costs and expenses  such as royalties and referral fees 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and related authoritative literature 

table of contents we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses  application service provider or asp and hosting services  maintenance post contract support and professional services 
maintenance includes telephone support  error correction or bug fixes and rights to upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license  each asp and hosting agreement and each maintenance and support and other professional services arrangements 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  is allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of the terms of specific transactions  vendor specific objective evidence of undelivered elements  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affects our results of operations and financial condition 
our specific guidelines and procedures for recognizing revenue are discussed in detail in note  paragraph c to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
under the applicable provisions of sop  as amended by sop  we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses upon the occurrence of all required conditions  including persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
each of these factors  particularly the collection of the resulting receivable  requires estimation and judgment by management 
revenues associated with license sales to distributors or to value added resellers are recognized when an end user customer has been identified and all other revenue recognition criteria above have been met 
revenue associated with license sales to us government agencies through a teaming arrangement with a third party partner are recognized when a signed order from our partner and evidence of a purchase order from the government agency to the partner is received and all other revenue recognition criteria above have been met 
thus  these types of transactions require management to make judgments as to these additional factors 
for arrangements with multiple elements for example  the sale of a product license along with the sale of maintenance and support  and training and consulting to be delivered later  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining amount at the time of shipment or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
thus  these types of arrangements require us to make judgments about the fair value of undelivered arrangements 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
billings to customers are generally due within to days 
however  in certain circumstances  we have offered extended payment terms greater than days but equal to or less than days to certain customers  for which license revenue is recognized upon shipment 
these customers are well capitalized and typically have entered into larger scale license arrangements with us 
we believe that we have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within the stated terms under these types of arrangements to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time license revenue is recognized 
in addition  in assessing whether collection is probable or not for a given transaction  and therefore whether we should recognize the revenue  we make estimates regarding the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through dun bradstreet  similar credit rating agencies or the customer s sec filings 
creditworthiness for transactions to existing customers is assessed through a review of their prior payment history 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of payment 

table of contents revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
revenues from consulting and education services are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
consulting and education services  including implementation  are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills and may be performed by the customer or other vendors 
in the event that we were to revise our estimates and judgments regarding the above  or regarding other aspects of our revenue recognition policies and practices  the timing and amounts of our reported revenue could be materially affected 
accounts receivable valuation and reserves we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and on our history of write offs of accounts receivable 
while we believe the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required and bad debt expense would increase by the amount we increased the allowances 
in addition to the allowance for uncollectible amounts  we also provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates 
if we were to experience return rates exceeding those provided for  an additional allowance for sales returns would be required  our total revenues would be reduced and our loss increased by the amount we increased the allowances 
historically very few of our returns and uncollectible receivables have been significant or have had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations valuation of intangible assets and goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 instead of amortizing goodwill and certain other long lived assets over time  we carry the asset on our balance sheet at its stated value and test it for impairment 
the test is performed both annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then a loss in operations to the extent of the impairment must be recorded 
because such impairment losses can occur irregularly and in varying amounts  our operating results may be subject to volatility if we have goodwill and other non amortizing assets on our balance sheet from time to time 
we do not currently carry any goodwill on our balance sheet 
when we acquired mindlever in april  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price of approximately million to goodwill 
we also allocated approximately million of the mindlever purchase price to developed technology and know how and  to assembled workforce 
this amount of million was being amortized over a period of three years 
these allocations represented management s estimate of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable intangible net assets that we acquired in the transaction 
in december  we conducted our first annual impairment test of the goodwill under sfas no 
to measure the value of the goodwill  we used a combination of the market value of the company and the net present value of the cash flows that we estimated our assets would produce over their useful lives 
we determined that the value of the goodwill was zero 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million  representing the entire carrying amount of goodwill  in the fourth quarter of accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain 
table of contents risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process requires us to estimate our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million as of december   primarily consisting of certain net operating losses and tax credits carried forward before they expire 
we have booked a valuation allowance in the full amount of this asset  million  as of december   due to uncertainty about our ability to utilize any of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

table of contents comparison of and revenues in millions change to change to of total revenues of total revenues license software services maintenance and professional services total revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million for  from million for the increase was attributable to a significant increase in license and software services revenues as well as continued growth in maintenance revenues 
we believe that revenues will continue to grow at a similar rate in in the range of to based on our plan to increase spending in sales and marketing in  our realignment of the inside sales organization with the field sales force  expansion of our network of value added resellers and changes in our sales strategy to focus on selling  both at the executive level and in new departments and divisions within our existing strategic accounts 
however  we expect license revenues to represent a greater portion of total revenues in as we generally recognize license revenues up front  upon shipment of the licenses to the customer  compared with software services revenues that generally are recognized over time as the service is used 
see business strategy in item of this report 
software license revenues increased by million  or  to million for  from million for the increase over last year was due to the growth in the number of total license transactions for both new and existing customers 
the average transaction size declined for new customers reflecting a more conservative buying pattern with lower initial investments to start 
the average transaction value for existing customers increased 
however  if we excluded the transaction in the third quarter of with the us army for million in licenses  the average transaction value for existing customers would have been flat with the prior year 
the average transaction value for existing accounts is higher than the average transaction value for new accounts in compared with last year in which the average transactions values were relatively the same 
in the future  we expect to see software license revenue growth continue to be generated in large part by our existing customer base as the direct sales force continues to focus on further penetration within existing accounts in an effort to implement enterprise wide solutions 
software license revenues represented of total revenues for and of total revenues for software services revenue  which includes our asp and hosting services  increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in software services revenue was primarily due to an increase in asp revenues  which represented of total software services revenues in  resulting from the growth of our asp orders in both and the increase in asp orders was attributed to higher volume in new asp accounts and continued high renewal rates for our asp services 
we believe that asp revenues will continue to grow in while new orders for asp services will slow down as we realign our inside telesales organization to support the field sales force and shift the sales of our asp services for small and medium sized businesses from our inside telesales organization to our indirect distribution channels 
longer term  we believe that our existing license customers will add asp services to facilitate reaching their external constituents  such as prospects  customers and channel partners  over the internet  in a secure environment without breaching the customer s behind the firewall network 
in addition  for new buyers who may require the flexibility of an outsourced service or who lack the information technology infrastructure and resources to deploy real time collaboration solutions on site  our asp or hosted services offering will be preferred 
software services revenues represented of total revenues for and of total revenues for 
table of contents maintenance and professional services revenues  which includes our maintenance  consulting and education services  increased by million  or  to million for  from million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the total number and dollar value of renewals of annual maintenance and support contracts  from the sales of new maintenance and support contracts associated with sales of licenses  and  to a lesser extent  from professional services revenues 
we expect total maintenance and professional services revenues to continue to increase in future periods as our installed base of license users grows and new maintenance contracts are added or increased  and as we continue to invest in and enhance our customer service capabilities  including state of the art training and education for our products and packaged consulting services  around best practice methodologies for enterprise deployment and integration 
maintenance and professional services revenues represented of total revenues for and of total revenues for cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues increased by  or  to  for  from  for the increase was attributable to higher royalty fees and fulfillment costs resulting from a higher volume of license revenues in since a significant portion of our license costs represent royalties that we pay to third parties on a per unit rate of product sold  primarily on server units  we expect that cost of license revenues will vary in the future based upon the unit volume of products sold 
cost of license revenues was of license revenues for both and amortization of acquired developed technology 
in connection with our acquisition of mindlever in april  we allocated approximately million to acquired developed technology  which is being amortized over a three year estimated useful life 
amortization of acquired developed technology was  for and in the first half of  we will incur  in amortization costs  after which the acquired developed technology asset will be fully amortized and no further costs will be incurred 
cost of software services revenue 
cost of software services revenue increased by  or  to million for  from million for due to an increase in the use of technical support services resulting from the growth in the number of asp service customers added in cost of software services revenue was of software services revenue for and of software services revenue for this decline in costs as a percentage of software services revenue reflects the increase in software services revenue in combined with a proportionally lower amount of additional asp service costs reflecting the increased capacity of our asp services as the result of our latest product release in june we anticipate that the cost of software services revenue will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that we must expand the capacity of our asp service to meet increased demand 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue increased by  or  to million for  from million for this increase was attributed to higher compensation expenses related to higher salaries 
cost of maintenance and professional services revenue was of maintenance and professional services revenue for and of maintenance and professional services revenue for reflecting the growth in higher margin maintenance services as compared to consulting and education services  which have a lower margin 
we anticipate that the cost of maintenance and professional services revenue will increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenues to the extent that we continue to acquire new customers and generate associated maintenance and professional services revenues 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or  to million for  from million for the increase resulted from an increase in sales commissions and bonuses due to a higher amount of orders received in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense due to the impact of a large write off  which was taken in the prior year and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in marketing programs  including advertising and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for in  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percent of total revenues as we plan to increase sales and marketing expenses in by approximately million or approximately million per quarter 
the increase in sales and marketing will be used to fund new marketing programs to promote sales of our products and services into the on line business communications and collaboration market  to increase the size of our sales organization and strengthen our sales operations infrastructure 
in addition to the increase of million  we expect sales commission and bonus expenses to increase in relation to the expected growth in total revenues 
we can give no assurance that our strategic efforts will succeed or that we will achieve the increase in sales that we hope for as a result 
see factors that could affect future results we may not successfully execute our strategic plan despite our significant planned investments  below 
product development expenses 
product development expenses decreased by  or  to million for  from million for the decrease resulted from a small decline in the average engineering headcount for  a decrease in outside translation costs as certain translation activities were either not required for recent product releases or were completed in house in and a reduction in depreciation expense as various capital assets became fully depreciated in and are still in service 
product development expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for we expect product development expenses to increase slightly in absolute dollars in future periods as we make small investments to develop new  and enhance existing  products to address the on line business communications and collaboration market  including adding research and development personnel  consulting services and the replacement of older computer equipment 
product development expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to decline 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for  from million for the increase was primarily due to increased recruiting costs attributed to the hiring of our new president and ceo  as well as increases in salaries and bonuses and incremental fees for consulting  legal and audit to comply with the regulations under the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for we expect our general and administrative expenses  primarily consulting  legal and audit fees  will increase slightly as the result of continued costs to comply with new and recently enacted regulations for public companies by the us government  such as the sarbanes oxley act of and costs associated with defending pending lawsuits 
see item  legal proceedings 
stock compensation charges 
we incurred charges of  or of total revenues for  a decrease of  from  or of total revenues  for this decrease was related to a decrease in stock compensation charges as certain stock options related to these charges in previous years have fully vested or were cancelled upon the termination of the option holder s employment in the options were related to the compensation expenses associated with the issuance of stock options in and with an exercise price lower than the fair market value on the date of grant 
these options  which vest over periods of between four and five years  will result in additional compensation expense of approximately  in and partially offsetting the effect of the vesting or cancellation of the options  was an increase related to a non cash charge in the third quarter of of approximately  for the acceleration of vesting and the extension of the time period to exercise certain stock options under the terms of a severance agreement with our former president and chief operating officer 
impairment charges 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
see critical accounting policies and estimates above 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill associated with our april acquisition of mindlever 
this charge 
table of contents amounted to a write off of the entire amount of the goodwill asset associated with the mindlever acquisition  and materially affected our results of operations for that year 
during  we did not carry any goodwill asset on our books 
merger transaction costs 
in  we recorded a charge of million for costs incurred related to the proposed merger with smartforce plc 
the costs consisted primarily of advisory  legal and retainer fees 
we did not incur any such costs in restructuring and severance charges 
during the year ended  we incurred severance charges totaling million  of which  was related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer in and  was related to the departure of several members of the executive management team in connection with a restructuring of the leadership of our domestic sales  marketing and business operations teams in the fourth quarter of in  we also recorded an additional  charge in connection with the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer  allocated to compensation expense  see stock compensation charges above 
in each of the departures described above  the severance costs consisted of guaranteed salary and bonus and related employee benefits ranging from six months to one year and are to be paid out over the next months 
we do not expect to incur any further charges related to these employee departures 
in april  in light of changing market dynamics and economic factors  we reduced our workforce by approximately or positions  primarily in the product development group  and in the sales and services departments  both domestically and internationally 
as a result of the restructuring  the company recorded a charge in of  for the associated severance payments  benefits and outplacement services provided to the employees affected by this restructuring 
the entire amount of this restructuring charge was paid in and no further charges related to this restructuring were incurred in interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  for  from  for the decrease was primarily attributable to declines in both the total average balances of  and average interest rates for  cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments in interest expense and other income expense  net

software license revenue decreased by million  or  to million for  from million for the decrease resulted from a decline in the average transaction value  fewer software license transactions and  to a lesser extent  a shift in customer buying patterns towards our asp service offerings in lieu of buying perpetual licenses 
external factors contributing to the decrease included a weak business economic environment in all geographic areas and reduced technology spending  which resulted in orders  particularly with new customers  being delayed  reduced in size or shifted to our asp service offerings instead of licenses

table of contents december  any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and dso may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and the length of our customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred asp and hosted services  maintenance and professional services billings as accounts receivable  and thus the timing of these billings can affect the dso calculation 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our dso and accounts receivable balance 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and will be subject to greater general credit risks 
at december   million in term loans under a previous equipment line of credit was outstanding as compared to million outstanding at december  of the total outstanding  million is payable in equal monthly principal installments of  per month plus interest 
interest is payable monthly based on the prime rate at december  plus 
the remaining outstanding amount of million  representing three separate loan advances  is payable in fixed monthly payments of principal and interest of   and  maturing at different times through june interest was charged at prime plus at the initiation of each of the loan advances  or  and  respectively 
all borrowings are secured by substantially all of centra s assets 
the current amended equipment line of credit requires centra to maintain a minimum balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and to hold of the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments in operating  deposit and investment accounts at the bank 
at december   the company was in compliance with the covenants under the equipment line of credit and the availability for borrowings under the current line has been fully used 
capital expenditures totaled  for and million for our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of assets to manage our internal operations and our asp service  including computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
purchases of computer equipment represent the largest component of our capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures to increase by over million from their levels as we expand our asp service infrastructure and improve and expand our internal information systems 
since inception  we have generally funded capital expenditures either through the use of working capital or with equipment bank loans 
as of december   our primary financial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under long term debt  capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations  including severance payments discussed elsewhere herein 
these commitments expire at various times through operating leases shown below are primarily for facility costs for the company s corporate headquarters  a product development facility and worldwide sales offices 
other contractual obligations primarily consist of minimum royalty fees payable by the company in connection with two software royalty agreements and certain costs for the use of facilities at a third party internet service provider for our hosted and asp service offerings and severance costs that will be paid out in of  in connection with the departure of several members of the company s executive management team and the retirement of the company s president and chief operating officer in years ended december  long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other contractual obligations total amounts in thousands less than year years years after years total 
table of contents included in the operating lease commitments above is approximately  for excess facilities related to the acquisition of mindlever  which has been accrued in accordance with purchase accounting 
included in other contractual obligations is an annual minimum royalty payment of  due each year that the company continues to incorporate the related technology into its product 
under the terms of our standard software license contracts  we indemnify our customers for the potential liability associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our software products 
there is a possibility that we could be found liable to our customers in the event that there is infringement occurring 
on august   a complaint was filed against centra and two other defendants by edisync systems  llc  in the united states district court for the district of colorado no 
d oes 
the complaint alleges infringement of two patents for a remote multiple user editing system and method and seeks permanent injunctive relief against continuing infringement  compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  and interest  costs and expenses associated with the litigation 
centra has filed an answer to the complaint denying all of the allegations 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and we intend to vigorously defend this action 
we have not accrued any amounts for the replacement or refund of any software products sold or any indemnification costs related to the edisync claim or any infringement through december  see item  legal proceedings 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and research and development credit carryforwards of million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not used 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
a full valuation allowance has been established in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to use available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
over the past two years  in response to business challenges and economic conditions  we have made considerable efforts to reduce our operating expenses through constrained spending and reductions in workforce 
this has resulted in a decrease in our cash used in operations  however  as of december  we still use more cash to operate our business than we generate in revenues 
as discussed above  we anticipate that our overall operating expenses in the immediate future will remain relatively flat or increase slightly in some areas  such as product development expenses and general and administrative expenses  while we intend to make significant investments in other areas  such as sales and marketing 
we anticipate that such operating expenses  along with capital expenditures  will constitute the most significant use of our cash resources 
although  if we have the opportunity  we may also use cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies  products or services 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which totaled approximately million at december   will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operating expenses  capital expenditures and any strategic efforts for at least the next months 
however  thereafter we may need to raise additional funds to support our operations  particularly if our strategic sales and marketing efforts do not produce the desired results 
we might also need to seek additional financing if we were to identify a strategic opportunity that required more cash than we had available at such time 
if we did seek to raise additional funds  though  we may not be able to obtain them on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
see factors that could affect future results we may require additional funds in this item recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and  in december  issued a revision to that interpretation fin r 
fin r replaces fin and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as a an ownership  contractual or monetary interest in an entity where 
table of contents the ability to influence financial decisions is not proportional to the investment interest  or b an entity lacking the invested capital sufficient to fund future activities without the support of a third party 
fin r establishes standards for determining under what circumstances vies should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary  including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply 
the company adopted the provisions of fin r during the three months ended december  we have no interest in any variable interest entities 
therefore  the adoption of fin r did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or variation inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have not issued any instruments with the characteristics addressed by sfas no 
 and so the adoption did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab no 
is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force  or eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
while the wording of sab no 
has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab no 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
factors that could affect future results as defined under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  some of the matters discussed in this filing contain forward looking statements regarding future events  including but not limited to statements about the beliefs and expectations of management regarding the company s future performance  the company s strategic initiatives  its ability to achieve and maintain a leadership position in real time conferencing and collaboration  demand for the company s software services and management s goals and objectives regarding future results of operations 
these statements reflect management s beliefs and expectations as of the date of this report  and involve risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results  events and performance to differ materially 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to risks associated with our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan  uncertainty of market reaction to our sales and marketing efforts  product demand for and market acceptance of the centra collaboration platform and our other current and future products and services  the effect of economic conditions  in general  on the market for it spending and for our products  the results of our future research and development activities  the impact of competitive products and pricing  technological difficulties and or other factors outside our control 
if any of the events described below were to actually occur  then our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement our operating plans as anticipated or achieve projected revenue and earnings goals 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the forward looking statements described above include  but are not limited to  the factors outlined below 

table of contents we may not successfully execute our strategic plan 
we expect to incur additional expenses of approximately million per quarter in pursuant to strategic initiatives we have undertaken to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities 
over the course of the next several operating periods we will be investing in additional resources to expand our sales channels and enhance our marketing activities 
we expect these efforts will help us to achieve our goals of increasing the size of our customer base in our target markets  broadening our relationships with existing customer accounts  and increasing market awareness of our products 
if we are not successful in achieving these objectives despite these significant planned expenditures  our liquidity and working capital will be materially diminished and the value of our stockholders investments could decrease 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not achieve profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  although we achieved a substantial decrease in our net loss for over  we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all  and if we do  we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
we plan for our operations to become profitable by the end of however  in order to accomplish this goal we expect to make significant investments in sales and marketing during as a result  we will need to generate a significant increase in revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we fail to achieve and maintain profitability as planned  then our investors expectations may not be met and the market price of our common stock may fall 
our future success depends to a significant degree on our senior management team 
in  we effected a number of significant changes to our senior management team  including paul r 
gudonis joined the company as president and chief executive officer  leon navickas  our founder  left the position of chief executive officer 
mr 
navickas remains chairman of the board of directors and has taken on the new role of chief strategy officer  anthony mark  our president and chief operating officer  retired  richard cramer joined the company as senior vice president of worldwide sales  and james l 
freeze joined the company in the newly created position of chief marketing officer 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to carry out this transition in senior management and to integrate the new people and positions into our operations  as well as on the efforts of our other senior managers 
these changes in our management team or the inability of our executive officers and key employees to work effectively as a team could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
we generally need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of our real time conferencing  collaboration and learning products and services before they will commit to the purchase of our products 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase and whether we have conducted business with the customer in the past 
both new and existing customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization prior to making purchase decisions 
any increases in the length of our sales cycle could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we face significant competition from other technology companies and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for real time conferencing  collaboration and learning products and services are highly competitive 
we expect that our competition in this market will intensify in the future which is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our real time conferencing  collaboration and learning solutions from a variety of software and services vendors 
in addition  larger companies with more resources than we have could enter our market and either reduce our sales or require us to lower our prices  or both 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
some have significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our success depends on our ability to successfully execute our marketing  sales and distribution initiatives 
to increase our revenues  we must increase our brand awareness through advertising and other marketing initiatives  increase the size and effectiveness of our direct field sales force  and enhance the effectiveness of our current  as well as develop new distribution channels and partner programs  including our value added resellers and integrated technology solution partners 
we will continue to focus on improving the productivity and effectiveness of our direct sales organizations through training and focused marketing programs 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in hiring  training and motivating our sales staff to increase productivity or in retaining qualified sales personnel 
in addition  we must effectively leverage our relationships with our indirect channel partners 
our existing  or future  indirect channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies including our competitors 
also  we may face conflicts between our sales force and our indirect channel partners 
our inability to effectively optimize the efforts of our marketing initiatives  our direct sales organizations  our partners and our indirect distribution channel could limit our future revenue growth and hurt our future operating results 
we may lose customers or incur losses if we experience system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of our hosted and asp services 
while our products can be deployed at a customer s premises or on its network as a packaged software application  we also deliver our products as an asp or hosted service utilizing our network 
our hosted and asp services depend on the efficient and continued operation of our internal and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems and our ability to avoid and mitigate any interruptions in service or reduced capacity 
some of our communications hardware and software is hosted at third party facilities 
these third party providers are vulnerable to business and economic uncertainties  as well as damage or interruption from human error  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism  all of which may affect their ability to continue to provide services 
interruptions in service or performance problems  for whatever reason  could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones 
in addition  any significant interruption in our service could result in losses to our customers 
although we attempt contractually to disclaim liability for any such losses  a court might not enforce a limitation on our liability  which could expose us to financial loss 

table of contents future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of internet based business and services 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content  taxation of products and services  encryption  network and information security  and the convergence of telephone and other traditional communication services with internet communications such as voice over internet telephony 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
any inconsistencies between state  federal and non us laws and regulations could affect distribution of our products and or increase our costs 
such legislation or regulation could also dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond effectively to technological changes and new industry standards and developments in new versions of our products 
as with any software technology  the demand and product specifications continue to change and therefore our future success will depend in large part on our ability to stay current with any technology shifts and meet the evolving needs of the market by timely introduction of new products or product releases 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products 
in addition  our product enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products  services or information technology infrastructure to adapt to these changes  standards and developments 
we face business risks relating to our international operations 
our success is focused on sales to multinational corporations  which requires us to have international operations and incur risks associated with those operations 
in addition to our north american operations  we have established sales  marketing and service operations in europe  the middle east  asia and australia and we sell through distributors and resellers in a number of countries around the world 
given our limited experience in international markets  we cannot be sure that our international operations will be successful 
our international operations require resources and management attention beyond those required for our domestic operations and subject us to additional regulatory  economic and political risks  including longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  adverse changes in trade and tax regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  the adoption of data privacy or other laws or regulations that restrict or regulate the use of our products or the internet  provisions of local laws governing our contracts in other countries  difficulties in managing an organization spread over several countries  including complications arising from cultural  language and time differences that may lengthen sales and implementation cycles  challenges relating to localization of technology  political and economic instability  and currency risks  including fluctuations in exchange rates 
given our limited experience in international markets we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to manage these risks effectively or that our international efforts will be successful 

table of contents we rely on third party technology to enhance our products 
we incorporate into our products software licensed from third party software companies that enhances  enables or provides functionality for our products 
third party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or with acceptable levels of support or functionality  or at all 
failure to maintain those license arrangements  failure of the third party vendors to provide updates  modifications or future versions of their software or defects and errors in  or infringement claims against  those third party products could delay or impair our ability to develop and sell our products 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights  other companies might use our technology to introduce competing products or services that compete with ours  without paying us for our technology 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our proprietary technology and intellectual property includes one pending us patent application  which has not yet been approved  and the centra trademark  among others 
we depend upon a combination of patent and trademark laws  license agreements  non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary and distribution rights of our products 
in addition  we attempt to protect our proprietary information and those of our vendors and partners through confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  they may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we resorted to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
claims by other companies that we infringe their proprietary technology could force us to redesign our products or otherwise hurt our financial condition 
if we were to discover that any of our products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer the product or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  that would enable us to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering 
also  our product license agreement terms state that we will indemnify our customers for any of their costs as a result of our infringement on other s technology  if any 
such costs could be substantial 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly developing technology environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products or cause our customers to stop using our products 
on august   edisync systems  llc  filed a complaint against us in federal court in denver  colorado  alleging infringement of two patents for a remote multiple user editing system and method and seeking to enjoin us from continuing to sell our products  as well as unspecified compensatory damages 
although we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend this action  we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome 
see legal proceedings 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures 
from time to time we have identified errors in our products after commercial introduction of the products 
while we have not been materially harmed by errors in the past  the occurrence of errors in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenues  loss of market share  diversion of product development resources  injury to our reputation or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
many of the business interactions supported by our products and services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused by our products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  and contractually attempt to limit liability  there can be no assurance that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the inability of our technical support services to meet customer needs and demands may adversely impact our financial results 
our products involve very complex technology and the failure or inability of our technical support staff to meet customer expectations in a timely manner or customer dissatisfaction with our product functionality or performance could result in loss of revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  injury to our reputation  liability for service or warranty costs and claims and other increased costs 
we may require additional funds 
we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to provide us with sufficient working capital for at least the next months 
however  our current plans and projections may prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flow may prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of product delays  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
therefore  we may need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest  particularly in real time conferencing  collaboration and learning software companies 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  defer our product development activities  or delay our continued rollout of new products and product versions 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  has been extremely volatile 
the announcement of new products  services  technological innovations  customers or distribution partners by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community and overall economic conditions are among the factors affecting our stock price 
in addition  the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management away from operating our business 

table of contents the general economic uncertainties in the united states and abroad continue to cause significant volatility in the stock markets 
the continued threat of terrorism in the united states and abroad  the ongoing military action and heightened security measures undertaken in response to that threat can be expected to cause continued volatility in securities markets 
in addition  foreign political unrest may continue to adversely affect the economy 
certain provisions of our charter and of delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions  including our stockholder rights plan  might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of centra or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
additionally  we have entered into agreements with certain employees and executive officers  which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
international sales are typically denominated in euros  british pounds  and australian dollars or in u 
s dollars 
since some of our sales internationally are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
in the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its revenues outside of the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are netted and included in other expense  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
a change in the valuation of the functional currencies relative to the us dollar as of december   would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december  interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of fixed rate us government backed federal agency notes and highly liquid money market instruments  with an average maturity of less than months  in accordance with our investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
our general investment policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and seeks to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments  which are typically held to maturity 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments in fixed rate interest earning financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates were to increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the portfolio 
if market interest rates were to decline  the interest earned on our investment portfolio would decrease 

table of contents we estimate that if the average yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december   would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of the year and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income and future changes in investment yields will largely depend on the gross amount of our portfolio 
certain of the long term debt instruments require interest payments calculated at variable interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase  the interest payments on those long term debt instruments would also increase 
the effect of any such increase in interest expense would be partially offset by any resulting increase in interest income from our investment portfolio
