see investment adviser and investment advisory agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates privately placed equity and mezzanine securities are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
initially  the fair value of each such security is based upon its original cost 
cost is also the primary factor used to determine fair value on an ongoing basis until significant developments or other factors affecting the investment such as results of subsequent financings  the availability of market quotations  the portfolio company s operations and changes in general market conditions provide a basis for value other than cost 
portfolio investments listed on a securities exchange or traded on the nasdaq stock market are valued at the closing price listed on the relevant exchange or quotation system on the date of valuation 
securities traded in the over the counter market are valued based on the average of the closing bid and asked prices on the date of valuation 
interest income is recorded on mezzanine investments when the payment is contractually due unless a loan is more than days past due 
interest is not accrued on any loans that are more than days past due 
dividend income is recorded on cumulative preferred equity securities on an accrual basis to the extent that such 
table of contents amounts are expected to be collected and on common equity securities on the record date for private companies or on the ex dividend date for publicly traded companies 
we assess the collectibility of dividends and interest income receivables in connection with our determination of the fair value of the related security 
to the extent that there are adverse future developments  previously recognized dividend and interest income may not be realized 
we account for our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance is captioned net change in net assets resulting from operations  which is the sum of two elements 
the first element is investment income loss  net  which is the difference between our income from interest  dividends and fees  and our operating expenses 
the second element is net gain loss on investments  which is the sum of the difference between the proceeds received from our dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost net realized gain loss on investments  and the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio net unrealized gain loss on investments 
net realized gain loss on investments and net unrealized gain loss on investments are directly related 
for example  in the period during which a security is sold to realize a gain  net unrealized gain on investments decreases  and net realized gain on investments increases 
historically  we have focused our investing activities on private equity securities 
we began making such investments in and are now entering into a phase of the business plan which emphasizes positioning our more mature portfolio companies for appropriate liquidity events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have invested in small and medium sized companies  and our investments are considered speculative in nature 
our investments often include securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale that adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities 
as a result  we are subject to risk of loss which may prevent our stockholders from achieving price appreciation and dividend distributions 
the portion of our portfolio consisting of investments in private companies is also subject to valuation risk 
we value our privately held investments based on a determination of their fair value made in good faith by our board of directors on a quarterly basis in accordance with our established guidelines 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated values of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would exist if a ready market for these securities existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net unrealized gain loss on investments 
we consider the management of equity price risk essential to conducting our business 
our portfolio consists of investments in private companies 
we anticipate no impact on these investments from modest changes in public market equity prices 
however  should significant changes in market prices occur  there could be a long term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains realized on these investments 
this could also affect our ability to generate cash through the sale of private equity investments  since there may not be realistic initial public offering opportunities 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our business is materially affected by inflation  other than the impact that inflation may have on the securities markets  the valuations of business enterprises and the relationship of such valuations to underlying earnings  all of which will influence the value of our investments
