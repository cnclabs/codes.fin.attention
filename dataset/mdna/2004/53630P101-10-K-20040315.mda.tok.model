overview we are a development stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development of products and processes intended to treat major medical indications such as cardiovascular disease  hiv and other viral infections in which lipids  or fat components  play a key role 
our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development  performing business  strategic and financial planning  and raising capital 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage 
on november   we completed our merger with nz 
the merger with nz was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was treated as a reverse acquisition because the stockholders of pre merger lipid owned the majority of our common stock immediately after the merger 
pre merger lipid was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  all financial information prior to november  included in this report reflects pre merger lipid results 
as a result of the merger  certain real estate assets were acquired  and thus our business was organized into two segments biotechnology and real estate 
in connection with the merger we announced our intent to conduct an orderly disposition of these assets and on march   we formalized a plan to discontinue the operations of our real estate segment 
in the course of our research and development activities  we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and begin to allocate significant and increasing resources to clinical testing and other activities related to seeking approval to market our products 
we intend to finance our operations through the disposition of the remaining real estate and other assets held by the company before the merger  through public or private equity or debt financings  the pursuit of research and development grants  and cash on hand 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the cash raised from the disposal of remaining real estate and other assets held by the company before the merger will provide sufficient working capital for our operations through mid in the longer term  we expect to additionally finance our operations through revenues from product sales and licenses upon receiving all relevant approvals 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy our requirements 
table of contents we may have to substantially reduce  or eliminate  certain areas of our product development activities  significantly limit our operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
on january   we announced a new strategic direction for the company and the application and development of our novel technology of plasma delipidation 
in connection with the adoption of this strategic direction  we also restructured our business operations 
the strategic plan was recommended by the management team and approved by the board of directors 
as part of the cost savings goal of the strategic plan  barry d 
michaels resigned as chief financial officer and certain other management and other staff positions were eliminated 
sandra gardiner  the company s vice president  controller and corporate secretary  assumed the newly created position of chief accounting officer 
in related appointments  marc bellotti  who was vice president of product development  assumed the position of vice president  research and development 
dale richardson  who was vice president of marketing and sales  assumed the position of vice president  business development 
the company believes it has strengthened its organizational capability and it intends to continue to do so in the future 
on december   we began the process of considering various strategic initiatives  including evaluating recent third party inquiries  to determine the best way for the company to capitalize on the major market opportunity represented by hdl therapy 
these initiatives may include the formation of strategic development or licensing partnerships  strategic business combinations  or alternative financings to maximize the value of our technology for our shareholders

accordingly  we have not  and do not intend to  separately track the costs for each of our research projects on a product by product basis

each perfected right entitled the holder to receive up to one additional share of the company s common stock 
stockholders had until april  to perfect their rights and were required to continue to hold their shares in direct registered form through november  to continue to qualify the right 
transfer of shares before november  would disqualify the right attached to the transferred shares 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock in december  and will issue additional shares of common stock in  to those individuals and entities who were stockholders of nz corporation on the day prior to the completion of the merger and who perfected their rights to receive additional shares of the company s common stock

critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  required that all registrants disclose and describe their critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition real estate properties real estate properties are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
all properties are held for sale and are written down to estimated fair value when the company determines the carrying cost exceeds the estimated selling price  less costs to sell 
management makes this evaluation on a property by property basis 
the evaluation of fair value and future cash flows from individual properties requires significant judgment 
our estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
it is reasonably possible that a change in economic or market conditions could result in a change in management s estimate of fair value 
loans and notes receivable all loans and notes receivable are written down to estimated fair value when the company determines that the loan is impaired 
among the factors used to determine whether a loan is impaired are creditworthiness of the borrower  whether or not the loan is performing  the value of any collateral for the loan  collectibility of the loan  and general economic and market conditions 
the determination of whether a loan is impaired 
table of contents requires significant judgment 
our estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our conclusions are based on factors that are inherently uncertain 
it is reasonably possible that a change in economic or market conditions could result in a change in management s estimate of fair value 
stock compensation the company accounts for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  thus  recognizes no compensation expense for those options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted  the company has elected to adopt the disclosure provisions only of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper factors to use in the computation of the amounts to be disclosed or recorded pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
income taxes the company follows sfas no  accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this report which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio consisting of government issued securities 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are accounted for at their amortized cost  as per fasb statement no 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
