critical accounting policies revenue recognition perma pipe recognizes revenues on contracts under the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is determined by the relationship of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of the contract 
provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income 
such revisions are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
claims for additional compensation due the company are recognized in contract revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated 
all other subsidiaries of the company recognize revenues at the date of shipment 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through maintenance of local production facilities in the markets served  invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products and use of foreign currency denominated debt in denmark 
the company has used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risks 
the forward contracts are short term in duration  generally one year or less 
the major currency exposure hedged by the company is the canadian dollar 
the contract amounts  carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts were not significant at january   and the changeover from national currencies to the euro began on january  and it has not materially affected and is not expected to materially affect the company s foreign currency exchange risk profile  although some customers may require the company to invoice or pay in euros rather than the functional currency of the manufacturing entity 
the company has attempted to mitigate its interest rate risk by maintaining a balance of fixed rate long term debt and floating rate debt 
commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as ferrous alloys eg  steel which we use in the production of piping systems 
the company attempts to mitigate such risks by obtaining price commitments from its commodity suppliers and  when it appears appropriate  purchasing quantities in advance of likely price increases
