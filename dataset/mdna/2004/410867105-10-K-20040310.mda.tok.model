glossary of selected insurance terms allmerica financial annual report introduction the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of allmerica financial corporation and subsidiaries afc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our results of operations include the accounts of the hanover insurance company hanover and citizens insurance company of america citizens  our principal property and casualty companies 
our results of operations also include the accounts of allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company afliac and first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic  our principal life insurance and annuity companies  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
hanover and citizens are domiciled in the states of new hampshire and michigan  respectively  while afliac and faflic are both domiciled in massachusetts 
executive overview this year was a year of transition for us 
we were focused on improving our property and casualty ratings  specifically returning our am best ratings to the a level  as well as completing the restructuring of our allmerica financial services business and conversion of our former agency sales force to that of an independent broker dealer 
in addition  we continued to monitor and improve our statutory capital levels in both our life and property and casualty insurance businesses 
additionally  in the property and casualty insurance business  we were focused on maintaining our profitability and retaining our policyholders in our commercial lines business  which is more sensitive to ratings downgrades 
we also executed strategies to improve the profitability of our personal lines business 
despite our ratings downgrades  we were able to essentially maintain existing levels of our property and casualty in force business and we obtained rate increases in a number of our lines of business 
during the second half of  we completed a strategic review of our business and concluded that our efforts should be concentrated on the property and casualty segment 
as such  returning our property and casualty am best ratings to the a level continued to be a key focus  since we believe these ratings are important to achieve profitable growth in the future 
in january  am best upgraded our ratings in our property and casualty business to a and also upgraded our life insurance businesses 
during  we also completed the cessation of sales of our proprietary life and annuity products  which began in the fourth quarter of we concluded the final transfer of assets related to our sale of our universal life business  and consolidated our infrastructure to manage the in force business and to reduce expenses 
in addition  we were focused on transforming our former agency distribution channel to a broker dealer operation  which generated brokerage and management income and related variable expenses 
we formed strategic alliances with other insurance companies to distribute their products through this operation 
after completing the review of our business strategy discussed above  we decided to cease the retail operations of the broker dealer in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in additional restructuring charges 
our earnings in the property and casualty business decreased primarily due to an adverse arbitration decision related to a reinsurance pool in which we formerly participated  as well as increased catastrophe losses 
we also strengthened our reserves related to our workers compensation line 
we experienced a modest profit in our life business in as compared to the large loss experienced in the prior year 
the loss in the prior year reflects the significant dac and related writeoffs resulting from our cessation of sales of our proprietary life and annuity products 
description of operating segments we offer financial products and services and conduct business principally in three operating segments 
these segments are property and casualty  allmerica financial services afs  and asset management 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
a summary of our reportable segments is included below 
our property and casualty segment manages property and casualty operations through two lines of business based upon product and identified as personal lines and commercial lines 
personal lines includes property and casualty coverages such as personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies  while commercial lines includes property and casualty coverages such as workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
our afs segment manages a block of existing variable annuity  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as certain group retirement products 
during  we also operated an independent broker dealer business  which was conducted through veravest investments  inc veravest 
veravest distributed third party investment and insurance products to retail customers until the fourth quarter of when such sales were terminated 
in addition  this segment actively manufactured and sold variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products until the fourth quarter of the asset management segment provides investment advisory services  primarily to affiliates and to third parties  such as insurance companies retirement plans and other fixed income clients  through its subsidiary  opus investment management  inc  a registered investment advisor 
this segment also includes amgro  inc amgro  our property and casualty insurance premium financing business 
prior to the fourth quarter of  faflic offered guaranteed investment contracts gics 
gics  also referred to as funding agreements  are investment contracts with either short term or long term maturities and are issued to institutional buyers or to various business or charitable trusts 
subsequently  we ceased selling gics  short term funding agreements were terminated and we retired certain long term funding agreements  at discounts 
allmerica financial annual report in addition to the three operating segments  we have a corporate segment  which consists primarily of cash  investments  corporate debt  capital securities mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the holding company and corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses reflect costs not attributable to a particular segment  such as those related to certain officers and directors  technology  finance  human resources and legal 
results of operations our consolidated net income loss includes the results of each of our four segments  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis 
in addition  segment income loss is adjusted for certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income loss of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including certain gains or losses on derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income loss excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring and reorganization costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income loss may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income loss enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income loss attributable to the normal operations of the business 
however  segment income loss should not be construed as a substitute for net income loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  as a result of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement no 
 we have reclassified dividends on our capital securities to interest expense in the corporate segment see corporate segment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

 we have restated prior periods to reflect current presentation 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in the increase in resulted primarily from a million improvement in segment net income  principally related to afs  partially offset by a million reduction in the corresponding federal income tax benefit 
also contributing to the increase in net income was a million change in net realized investment gains losses to a net gain of million from a net loss of million for partially offsetting these increases in net income was a decrease in gains from the retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations of million and a change of million in losses gains on derivative instruments to a net loss of million in from a net gain of million in in  our consolidated net loss increased million  to million  compared to million in the increase in net loss resulted primarily from a change in segment income of million to a segment loss of million in  from segment income of million in  principally the result of a significant segment loss in afs 
this was partially offset by a million change in the corresponding federal income taxes from a tax expense of million in to a tax benefit of million in also contributing to this decline was a million loss from the sale of the universal life business and a million increase in restructuring and reorganization costs 
partially offsetting these items were a million gain from the retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations and a million change in losses gains on derivative instruments  from a net loss of million in  to a net gain of million in the following table reflects segment income loss and a reconciliation to consolidated net income loss

afs segment income in includes charges of million relating to the impairment of assets resulting from our decision to discontinue the retail operations of veravest 
the loss in the afs segment reflects net charges of million resulting from the cumulative effect of the significant  persistent decline in equity market values  ratings downgrades see rating agency actions  and our decision to cease sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products see segment results allmerica financial services 
these charges include million of additional amortization of the deferred policy acquisition cost dac asset and million due to a change in the assumptions related to the long term cost of guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb for variable annuity products  net of the related dac amortization 
in addition  we recognized impairments of capitalized technology costs associated with variable products totaling million 
the decrease in property and casualty segment income is primarily attributable to an increase in adverse development of prior years loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves of million  including charges of million resulting from an adverse arbitration decision within a voluntary insurance pool that we exited in catastrophe losses increased million in in addition  segment income decreased due to a million increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses  as well as an million decrease in net investment income 
these were partially offset by an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
additionally  a decrease in policies in force resulted in declines in premiums and losses  as well as segment income 
the federal income tax benefit was million for  compared to a million benefit in the large benefit in is primarily the result of the loss recognized by the afs segment as well as an million favorable settlement of federal income tax returns related to through compared to our segment income loss before federal income taxes was a million loss in  compared to income of million in this decline is attributable to a decrease of million from the afs segment  partially offset by an increase from the property and casualty segment of million 
the decrease in the afs segment reflects the charges described above 
the increase in property and casualty segment income is primarily attributable to an estimated benefit of approximately million related to net premium rate increases  a million decrease in the adverse development of prior years reserves and a million decrease in catastrophe losses 
additionally  segment income increased due to approximately million of decreased current accident year non catastrophe claims 
partially offsetting these items were increased policy acquisition expenses of million and lower net investment income of million 
the federal income tax benefit was million for  compared to an expense of million in this tax benefit is primarily the result of the significant loss recognized by the afs segment in other items the change in net realized investment gains losses  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization  in primarily resulted from million of after tax gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
these gains were partially offset by impairments of million  net of taxes  primarily related to fixed maturities 
during  net realized investment losses  after taxes and amortization  were million  primarily due to million of fixed maturity impairments  net of taxes  and million of after tax losses related to the termination of certain derivative instruments 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
during  net realized losses on investments  after taxes and amortization  were million  primarily due to after tax realized losses from impairments of fixed maturities of million 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed maturities 
losses gains on derivative instruments  net of taxes  decreased million to a net loss of million in as a result of derivative activity that does not meet the requirements of hedge accounting 
during  we recognized gains on derivatives  net of taxes  of million as a result of the termination of certain derivative instruments  which previously were recognized as ineffective hedges 
during  we recognized losses on derivatives  net of taxes  of million 
these losses primarily represent an accounting charge for hedge ineffectiveness on certain derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
see derivative instruments 
in  we recognized a gain on the retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations of million  net of taxes  compared with a gain of million in these gains resulted from the retirement of certain long term funding obligations at discounts see significant transactions gain on retirement of funding obligations 
during  we recognized income of million  net of taxes  from the settlement of post closing items related to the december sale of our universal life insurance business through a coinsurance agreement see significant transactions sale of universal life business 
in  allmerica financial annual report we recognized a loss of million  net of taxes  related to this transaction 
in  we recognized an after tax charge of million related to the restructuring of our afs segment  including veravest 
in  we recognized an after tax charge of million related to the restructuring of our afs segment 
these restructuring costs consisted of severance and other employee benefit related expenses  as well as the cancellation of certain lease agreements and contracted services 
in addition  we recognized  in  other reorganization costs of million  net of taxes  primarily related to the forgiveness of interest on certain loans to afs agents 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an after tax charge of million for severance and other employee related costs resulting from the reorganization of our technology support group 
during  we recognized an after tax loss of million related to the exit of selected property and casualty agencies  policies  groups  and programs 
this loss primarily reflects an increase in loss reserves for both the current and prior accident years 
this resulted from a process whereby we evaluated our approximately  agencies in the property and casualty segment and identified agencies that did not meet certain profitability standards or were not strategically aligned with us 
for these agents  we either terminated the relationship or restricted the agent s ability to offer commercial lines policies 
certain groups and specialty programs were also discontinued see property and casualty selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
voluntary pool losses reflect our participation in a reserve deficiency of a voluntary excess and casualty reinsurance pool 
from to  we voluntarily participated in this reinsurance pool along with several other property and casualty carriers 
the pool was dissolved in and since that time has been in run off 
during the fourth quarter of  the pool obtained results from an independent actuarial review of its current reserve position  which noted a range of reserve deficiency  primarily as a result of adverse development of asbestos claims 
as a result of this study  we recognized losses  net of taxes  of million  based on our participation in the reserve deficiency 
during  we recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  we recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
net income loss includes the following items net of taxes by segment in millions property and casualty allmerica financial services asset management corporate total net realized investment gains losses  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization losses gains on derivative instruments gain from retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations income from sale of universal life business restructuring costs net realized investment losses gains  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization net gains on derivative instruments gain from retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations loss from sale of universal life business restructuring costs other reorganization costs other items net realized investment losses  net of taxes and deferred acquisition cost amortization net losses on derivative instruments sales practice litigation restructuring costs loss from selected property and casualty exited agencies  policies  groups and programs voluntary pool losses allmerica financial annual report segment results the following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment 
the segment results are presented before taxes and minority interest and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations including realized gains and losses 
property and casualty the following table summarizes the results of operations for the property and casualty segment for the years ended december in millions segment revenues net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income other income total segment revenues losses and lae policy acquisition expenses other operating expenses segment income compared to property and casualty segment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease in segment income is primarily attributable to an increase in adverse development on prior years reserves of million  to million of adverse development for the year ended december   from million of adverse development for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a charge of million from an adverse arbitration decision related to a single large property claim within a voluntary insurance pool 
we exited this pool in in addition  prior years workers compensation reserves developed adversely  partially offset by favorable development in commercial multiple peril reserves 
catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in catastrophe losses in were unusually low 
additionally  segment income for the year ended december  was negatively affected by a million increase in policy acquisition and other operating expenses  primarily due to an increase in commissions and expenses 
commissions and expenses increased due to special commission and financial guarantee programs designed to minimize the impact to our commercial lines business from the ratings downgrades in policy acquisition and other operating expenses also increased due to higher employee benefits and technology costs 
net investment income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in partially offsetting these negative items was a benefit from an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
net premium rate increases reflect rate actions  discretionary pricing adjustments  inflation and changes in exposure  net of the estimated impact of loss inflation and policy acquisition costs 
in addition  a decrease of policies in force since december  contributed to declines in premiums and losses  as well as segment income 
compared to property and casualty segment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
in addition  development on prior years reserves improved million  to million of adverse development for the year ended december  from million of adverse development for the year ended december  the favorable change in reserve development in is primarily the result of improving commercial lines claim frequency  partially offset by adverse development in the personal automobile line 
net catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december  in addition  losses and lae decreased during due to approximately million of decreased current accident year claims frequency primarily in the workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multi peril and homeowners lines 
partially offsetting these items is a decrease in net investment income of million 
policy acquisition expenses increased as a result of the variable expenses related to the aforementioned premium rate increases  primarily commissions and premium taxes 
in addition  policy acquisition expenses increased million as a result of higher premium tax and commission rates during other income decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to the decline in finance charge income as a result of the transfer of amgro from the property and casualty segment to the asset management segment 
allmerica financial annual report product line results underwriting results are reported using statutory accounting principles  which are prescribed by state insurance regulators 
the primary difference between statutory accounting principles and gaap is the deferral of certain underwriting costs under gaap that are amortized over the life of the policy 
under statutory accounting principles  these costs are recognized when incurred or paid 
we review the operations of this business based upon statutory results 
in  we reorganized our property and casualty segment 
under the new structure  the property and casualty segment manages its operations through two lines of business based upon product offerings and identified as personal lines and commercial lines 
personal lines include personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies  while commercial lines include workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the property and casualty segment for the years ended december in millions  except ratios statutory net premiums written statutory loss ratio statutory net premiums written statutory loss ratio statutory net premiums written statutory loss ratio personal lines personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal commercial lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial total statutory combined ratio personal lines commercial lines total statutory underwriting loss gain personal lines commercial lines total reconciliation to segment income net investment income other income and expenses  net corporate overhead expenses net deferred acquisition expenses provision for uncollectible accounts policyholders dividends other statutory to gaap adjustments segment income statutory loss ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio reflects incurred claims compared to premiums earned 
the ratios exclude the effect of agency actions discussed in selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs and the voluntary pool losses discussed in asbestos and environmental reserves 
statutory combined ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred claims and claim expenses to premiums earned and the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred to premiums written 
federal income taxes  net investment income and other non underwriting expenses are not reflected in the statutory combined ratio 
statutory underwriting results include certain overhead expenses  which on a gaap basis are reflected in the corporate segment 
allmerica financial annual report compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of an increase of million  or in the homeowners line 
partially offsetting this increase is a decrease of million in the personal automobile line 
the increase in the homeowners line is primarily the result of an average net premium rate increase of since december  the decrease in the personal automobile line resulted primarily from a decrease of in policies in force  partially offset by an average net premium rate increase of since december  personal lines statutory underwriting results declined million to an underwriting loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in underwriting loss is primarily due to an increase in claim frequency and severity due to the harsher winter weather during the first quarter  especially in the northeast 
in addition  catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in also  we experienced an increase in severity of personal automobile medical costs related to personal injury protection coverage in michigan 
underwriting results were also unfavorably affected by an million increase in adverse development during in the personal automobile line 
personal lines expenses increased due to the aforementioned increase in commissions  employee benefits and technology costs 
partially offsetting these items is an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the agency management actions we took in and our continuing re underwriting efforts see selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
as a result of these actions  policies in force decreased  and in the commercial automobile  workers compensation  and commercial multiple peril lines  respectively  since december  we do not expect these actions to have a material impact in this decrease is also partially due to lower retention rates in certain lines as a result of the ratings downgrades and a reduction in average policy premium  as we wrote a smaller proportion of large to medium sized accounts compared to medium to small policies 
we think of small commercial policies as having premiums less than  medium policies as having premiums greater than  but less than  and large policies as having premiums greater than  partially offsetting these items were net premium rate increases in all of the commercial lines since december  commercial lines underwriting results decreased million to an underwriting gain of million for the year ended december  the decrease in underwriting results is primarily attributable to the aforementioned charge of million from the voluntary pool arbitration decision 
in addition  catastrophe losses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in development on prior years reserves declined million to million of favorable development for the year ended december   compared to of favorable development for the same period in this decline in commercial lines favorable development is primarily due to adverse development in the workers compensation line  partially offset by favorable development in the commercial multiple peril line 
commercial lines expenses increased due to the aforementioned commissions and financial guarantee expenses  as well as employee benefits and technology costs 
partially offsetting these items is an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of increases of million  or  and million  or  in the personal automobile and homeowners lines  respectively 
the increase in the personal automobile line is primarily the result of  and net premium rate increases in michigan  new york and new jersey  respectively  since december  the increase in the homeowners line resulted primarily from net premium rate increases of and in michigan and new york  respectively 
policies in force for all personal lines decreased since december  personal lines underwriting results declined million to an underwriting loss of million for the year ended december  the decline in underwriting results is primarily attributable to increased underwriting expenses  principally related to the increased expenses for mandatory assigned risk personal automobile business in new york 
in addition  underwriting expenses increased due to higher premium tax expenses and increases in agents contingent commissions 
underwriting results were also unfavorably affected by increased current year claims frequency in the personal automobile line for the year ended december  and by an million increase in adverse development during in the personal automobile line 
partially offsetting these items is an estimated million of net premium rate increases 
in addition  catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in allmerica financial annual report commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the agency management actions we took in as a result of these actions  policies in force decreased  and in the commercial automobile  workers compensation  and commercial multiple peril lines  respectively  since december  partially offsetting these decreases in policies in force were rate increases in all of the commercial lines since december  commercial lines underwriting results improved million to an underwriting gain of million for the year ended december  the improvement in underwriting results is primarily attributable to approximately million of net premium rate increases during the year ended december  development on prior years reserves improved million to million of favorable development for the year ended december  from million of adverse development for the same period in in addition  catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in in  underwriting results also included a net benefit  when compared to  as the result of exiting historically unprofitable business under the aforementioned agency management actions 
investment results net investment income before taxes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net investment income in  compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities and an increased emphasis on higher credit quality fixed maturities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in compared to in due to the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and the aforementioned shift to higher credit quality fixed maturities 
the decrease in net investment income also reflects a reduction in average invested assets as a result of a million dividend from the property and casualty companies to the holding company in july and a transfer of million in january to fund the property and casualty companies portion of the additional minimum pension liability we recognized at december  we expect our investment results will continue to be negatively affected by lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates 
the decrease in net investment income in  compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities  as well as a reduction in average invested assets 
this reduction in assets resulted from the million dividend referenced above and the transfer of million to fund the property and casualty companies portion of the additional minimum pension liability we recognized at december  in addition  net investment income decreased due to the impact of defaults on certain high yield fixed maturities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in  compared to in  due to the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  involving actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
we determine the amount of loss and lae reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is highly judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  we develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions that we use in the estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and the expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
because the amount of the loss and lae reserves are sensitive to our assumptions  we do not completely rely on only one estimate to determine our loss and lae reserves 
rather  we develop several estimates using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in various loss and lae reserve outcomes and we adopt the best estimate 
we may determine that the low or high end estimate calculated by the method does not represent a reasonable estimate  because certain projection methodologies may not result in a reasonable reserve estimate for a particular line of business due to certain underlying data or assumptions 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
allmerica financial annual report management s review of judgments and key assumptions there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
we maintain a practice of significantly limiting the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
the industry has experienced recent adverse loss trends in these lines of business 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs 
recently  we have experienced increasing medical costs associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
loss reserves by line of business we perform actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual estimates are summarized into six broader lines of business personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril  and other lines 
the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and lae as follows for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year increase in provision for insured events of prior years losses related to selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs for current year total incurred losses and lae payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses reserve for losses and lae  end of year the increase in provision for insured events of prior years in includes million of losses related to selected property and casualty exited agencies  policies  groups and programs and million of losses related to voluntary pool claims 
as part of an ongoing process  the reserves have been re estimated for all prior accident years and were increased by million  million and million in and and  respectively 
allmerica financial annual report the table below summarizes the reserve for losses and lae by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial total reserve for losses and lae prior year development by line of business the table below summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions increase decrease in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years increase in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years during the years ended december    and  estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed unfavorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the unfavorable loss reserve development in is primarily the result of the million charge in the other commercial line resulting from the aforementioned voluntary pool arbitration decision 
additionally  loss reserves for the workers compensation line were increased by million in the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of increasing medical costs 
loss reserve development was also affected by an increase in personal automobile claim severity related to medical settlements in michigan 
because these settlements have risen beyond previous estimates  reserve increases have been recognized in the period in which the information was obtained 
partially offsetting these items was favorable development in the commercial multiple peril line due to improved claim frequency in the accident year resulting from our re underwriting efforts 
the adverse development in both and is primarily the result of increased claim severity related to personal automobile medical settlements in michigan 
the increase in the prior year reserve estimates for other commercial lines during is primarily due to the recognition of approximately million in additional reserves for asbestos claims in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool 
in addition  in a reserve increase of million on prior years resulted from the agency management actions discussed in selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
this reserve increase affected primarily the commercial multiple peril  personal automobile  commercial automobile and workers compensation lines 
additionally  other commercial lines prior year reserves developed adversely due to a million reserve increase in the ecra voluntary pool 
personal automobile prior year reserves developed adversely due to the aforementioned increased claim severity related to medical settlements in michigan 
in addition to the effect from the agency management actions  the commercial automobile and commercial multiple peril lines experienced adverse development 
the increased reserves in these lines is primarily attributable to increased claim payments in the and accident years 
as these payments have increased above historical amounts  actuarial projections of future settlements have increased the estimated ultimate reserves on prior years 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable development in all periods is primarily attributable to claims process improvement initiatives taken by us during the to calendar year period 
since  we have lowered claim settlement costs through increased utilization of in house attorneys and consolidation of claim offices 
as actual experience begins to establish certain trends inherent within the claim settlement process  the actuarial process recognizes these trends within the reserving methodology impacting future claim settlement assumptions 
as these measures improved average settlement costs  the actuarial estimate of future settlement costs are reduced and favorable development is recorded 
these measures are complete 
allmerica financial annual report asbestos and environmental reserves although we do not specifically underwrite policies that include asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  we may be required to defend such claims 
the table below summarizes direct business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools december in millions asbestos environ mental total asbestos environ mental total asbestos environ mental total beginning reserves incurred losses lae paid losses lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the outstanding reserves for direct business asbestos and environmental damage have remained relatively consistent for the three year period ended december  as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to the our total loss and lae incurred experience 
we estimate our ultimate liability for these claims based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
in addition  we are not aware of any litigation or pending claims that are expected to result in additional material liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
the environmental liability could be revised in the near term if the estimates used in determining the liability are revised 
in addition  and not included in the table above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
we participated in the ecra voluntary pool during to  until it was dissolved and put in runoff in our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of million annually over the past ten years 
during  the pool commissioned an independent actuarial review of its then current reserve position  which noted a range of reserve deficiency primarily as a result of adverse development of asbestos claims 
as a result of this study  we recorded an additional million of losses in the fourth quarter of  which is included in the reported outstanding loss and lae reserves 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that these reserves will be sufficient 
selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs during the fourth quarter of  we completed an extensive review of our agency relationships which resulted in the termination of agencies and the withdrawal of commercial lines underwriting authority from an additional agencies 
these actions affected approximately of approximately  active agencies representing us in these agencies had consistently produced unsatisfactory loss ratios 
in addition  we terminated virtually all of our specialty commercial programs and discontinued a number of special marketing arrangements 
the total earned premium associated with the exited business was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the estimated future premium deficiency on these policies is million and this loss was recorded during in connection with these actions  we performed an actuarial review of outstanding reserves with segregated loss history on the exited business 
based on this review  an increase to reserves of million was recorded in this increase includes million of adverse development in and million of adverse development on prior year reserves  which is net of a million benefit from our whole account aggregate excess allmerica financial annual report of loss reinsurance treaty  which provides coverage for accident year see reinsurance section below 
under the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty  we recognized a net benefit of million  including the aforementioned million benefit related to prior year reserves 
in addition  as a result of projected future losses on the exited business  we recorded an impairment to the dac asset of million 
this resulted in an increase in policy acquisition expenses and a decrease in our dac asset balance as of december  the total charge of million has been presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of income and has been excluded from segment income due to our belief that this item is not indicative of our core operations 
actual future losses from the exited business may vary from our estimate 
reinsurance our property and casualty segment maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and allocated lae activity 
this includes excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on our evaluation of the risks accepted and analyses prepared by consultants and reinsurers and on market conditions including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on a review of our reinsurers financial statements and reputations in the reinsurance marketplace  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect the ceding insurer from significant losses arising from a single event such as windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements  we ceded million of losses in and million of losses in  as a result of deterioration in the accident year  and million of losses in in  we entered into a whole account aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which provides coverage for accident year for our property and casualty business 
the program covered losses and allocated lae  including those incurred but not yet reported  in excess of a specified whole account loss and allocated lae ratio 
as a result of this agreement  we recognized net expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and and a net benefit of million for the year ended december   based on estimates of losses and allocated lae for accident year the effect of this agreement on the results of operations in future periods is not currently determinable  as it will be based both on future losses and allocated lae for accident year we are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to the ability to conduct certain business in various states  we are required to participate in various residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide various insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers and the michigan catastrophic claims association 
allmerica financial services prior to september   the allmerica financial services segment manufactured and sold variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as certain group retirement products 
in the fourth quarter of and as a result of ratings downgrades see rating agency actions  we ceased the sale of proprietary products 
as a result  the factors that affect our results of operations after the cessation of sales of proprietary products are substantially different from those in effect prior to that date 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued the retail sales operations of our broker dealer  veravest  which sold non proprietary products through our former life insurance and annuity agency channel 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of asset impairments as a result of this action 
of this amount  million relates to receivables and fixed assets and million relates to capitalized technology costs 
we also incurred a pre tax charge of million for severance and other expenses related to exiting our broker dealer business and expect to incur an additional pre tax charge of approximately million to million  primarily in the first quarter of we expect that brokerage and investment management income and brokerage and investment management variable expenses will be significantly lower than in the past 
operating expenses associated with this business will also be lower primarily due to lower employee related costs 
in addition  this decision may have a negative impact on persistency and financial results in the policies that were sold through our former agency distribution channel 
although we believe that our current  overall allmerica financial annual report dac assumptions remain reasonable  we cannot provide assurance that persistency in this channel will not differ from our assumptions  and therefore dac amortization may be affected in future periods 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the allmerica financial services segment for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december in millions segment revenues premiums fees fees from surrenders other proprietary product fees net investment income brokerage and investment management income other income total segment revenues policy benefits  claims and losses policy acquisition costs brokerage and investment management variable expenses other operating expenses segment income loss brokerage and investment management income primarily reflects fees earned from the distribution of non proprietary insurance and investment products as well as the management of assets for proprietary products through veravest 
variable expenses related to this business primarily consist of commissions and subadvisory fees 
compared to allmerica financial services segment income was million in compared to a loss of million in income in includes a charge of million relating to the impairment of assets resulting from our decision to discontinue the retail operations of veravest 
the loss in reflects the net charges of million relating to the shutdown of proprietary life insurance and annuity product sales 
the following table summarizes the aforementioned charges and benefits for these items are discussed in further detail in the deferred acquisition costs  guaranteed minimum death benefits and technology costs sections of this discussion 
for the year ended december in millions additional dac amortization revision of surrender rate assumptions equity market depreciation revision of market related appreciation assumptions revision of gmdb long term cost assumptions revision of future fees assumption impairment of dac asset gmdb revision of long term cost assumptions reduction of dac amortization impairment of capitalized technology costs total our decision to cease sales of proprietary products and ratings downgrades during resulted in a substantial increase in redemptions of variable annuities  beginning in the fourth quarter of annuity redemptions in were billion compared to billion in  of which billion occurred during the fourth quarter of additional surrender fees received in were largely offset by additional dac amortization  reflecting our current dac assumptions  which mandate a higher amortization level as a percentage of gross profits 
other proprietary fees decreased million  to million in  primarily due to the sale of our universal life insurance business see significant transactions sale of universal life insurance business and to lower average variable annuity asset levels 
average variable annuity asset levels declined primarily as a result of the cumulative redemptions during the prior twelve months 
net investment income declined million  to million in  primarily due to lower average invested general account assets 
this resulted primarily from increased redemptions and the transfer of assets related to the sale of the universal life insurance business 
in addition  net investment income decreased due to the replacement of high yield investments with lower yielding  higher quality fixed income securities see investment portfolio 
brokerage and investment management income increased million  to million in prior to our discontinuance in the fourth quarter of of the retail sales operations of our broker dealer  increased sales of non proprietary products resulted in additional brokerage income of million 
the fees generated from these sales were allmerica financial annual report partially offset by additional commissions of million paid to registered representatives during investment management income declined million due to lower average assets under management 
other income increased million in  to million primarily due to increased revenues generated by higher asset based distribution fees and a termination fee related to one large group variable universal life insurance client 
policy benefits in decreased million  to million 
during  based on our revised expectations for the long term cost of gmdb  we recorded a reserve increase of million 
excluding the effect of the reserve adjustments in  policy benefits would have decreased million 
this decline is primarily the result of the sale of our universal life insurance business and lower expenses related to gmdb 
additionally  policy benefits decreased due to a decline in interest credited on general account assets resulting from lower average general account assets 
expenses related to gmdb  excluding the aforementioned million reserve adjustment  declined million  from million in to million in see also guaranteed minimum death benefits below 
policy acquisition expenses decreased million  to million in as discussed in detail in the deferred acquisition costs section below  during  we recorded adjustments to dac amortization totaling million 
in addition  as a result of the million gmdb reserve adjustment mentioned above  dac amortization was reduced by million in these adjustments during represent more than the entire difference from the current year 
in fact  absent these adjustments  policy acquisition expenses would have increased million in versus the primary reason for this million adjusted increase in dac amortization is that we now apply a higher amortization percentage  as mandated by our current dac assumptions  to current gross profits generated by existing annuity accounts 
higher amortization percentages have been used since the fourth quarter of additionally  we had incremental dac amortization expenses related to redemptions  as described above 
these increases in dac amortization were partially offset by additional items resulting in a million net decrease in dac amortization in see deferred acquisition costs below for a detailed discussion of these adjustments to the dac asset in brokerage and investment management variable expenses increased million  to million in the increase primarily reflects the aforementioned million increase in commissions  partially offset by lower investment management expenses due to lower average assets under management 
other operating expenses decreased million  to million in the decrease is primarily due to a million impairment expense in related to technology used in our proprietary variable annuity and variable universal life business 
of this amount  million related to capitalized software development costs 
the remaining million related to technology hardware 
in  we recognized the aforementioned million charge related to asset impairments resulting from our decision to discontinue retail operations of veravest 
of the million  million relates to receivables and fixed assets and million relates to software costs 
see technology costs below for a detailed discussion of these items 
excluding the asset impairments in and  other operating expenses would have decreased million 
this decrease reflects lower distribution and insurance operation expenses  partially offset by acquisition costs that we had been allowed to defer in  as they related to proprietary annuity and insurance sales 
we no longer offer these products  so we are no longer deferring these types of costs 
compared to segment results deteriorated million  to a loss of million during this loss reflects the aforementioned net charges of million 
during  fees from surrenders increased million  to million as a result of increased annuity redemptions  primarily in the fourth quarter as a result of the ratings downgrades 
this increase was partially offset by a million decline in all other fees related to proprietary products  primarily resulting from lower average invested assets 
deferred acquisition costs as discussed further in critical accounting policies  dac for variable life products and variable annuities consists of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs that are amortized in proportion to the estimated total gross profits from such products 
we estimate that these costs will be earned over the expected life of the insurance contracts to which such costs relate 
to estimate the profitability of our insurance contracts  we establish and apply assumptions relating to  among other matters  appreciation of account assets  contract persistency and contract costs such as those relating to any gmdb feature and fees payable to distributors 
we regularly evaluate these assumptions to determine whether recent experience or anticipated trends merit adjustments to such assumptions 
allmerica financial annual report the substantial and sustained decline in the equity market  culminating in the third quarter of  precipitated a number of significant events which caused us to incur large increases in dac amortization 
these included  in large part  substantial ratings downgrades  which contributed to our decision to cease new sales of proprietary variable annuity and life products 
we believe that this business decision will adversely affect the profitability of our existing policies and contracts by significantly decreasing the persistency of customer accounts 
decreased persistency also will increase the cost of the gmdb feature of variable annuity contracts  further reducing profitability 
this results from a reduction of revenues in future periods due to a decline in average invested assets  whereby the revenues will not be sufficient to offset gmdb claims in the near term 
in addition  the market decline resulted in significant differences in actual account value investment returns from those assumed 
this required us to substantially increase the level of dac amortization and gmdb expense under existing assumptions and to reassess the appropriate long term assumptions on account appreciation and gmdb cost 
as a result  we revised downward our assumptions regarding future account appreciation and increased expectations regarding the long term cost of the gmdb feature 
finally  our evaluation of the compounding effects of the market decline and afs business model changes on the anticipated profitability of our distribution channels caused us to determine that there had been a permanent impairment of the remaining dac asset related to the former partners distribution channel see annuity account values and redemptions for a description of the former distribution channels 
each of these increased costs and changed assumptions are discussed further below 
the aforementioned million of dac adjustments in consisted of six separate items 
first  we anticipated that ratings downgrades see rating agency actions and our decision to cease new sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products would unfavorably affect the persistency of then existing customer accounts 
this resulted in the reduction of our estimate of future gross profits and million of additional dac amortization in second  we reduced our estimate of future gross profits expected from our then existing variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies  resulting in additional amortization of million in  reflecting the significant and sustained declines in equity market values and our application of the reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
third  we reviewed and reset our assumptions regarding future market related appreciation of separate account assets and our application of the reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
in view of the additional market declines in the third quarter of  as well as the reduced time horizon resulting for the revised persistency expectations  we reduced our expected rate of annual appreciation to percent percent per quarter  starting with september  asset levels 
this reduced expected future profits and resulted in million of additional dac amortization in fourth  we increased our assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products see the discussion of gmdb reserves below 
the increased cost estimates affected our expectation of future gross profits  resulting in additional dac amortization of million in fifth  we changed our estimates of future fees from certain annuity contracts  which decreased amortization by million in finally  we recognized additional amortization of million in related to our former partners distribution channel 
after reviewing all assumptions affecting future profits assumed in our dac methodology  including the effect of the aforementioned adjustments  we determined that the remaining dac asset related to partners exceeded the present value of total expected gross profits by million 
accordingly  we recognized a permanent impairment to our dac asset of this amount 
a permanent impairment in was not required for the other distribution channels because of their higher expected profitability 
during  we had six additional items reducing dac amortization by a total of million 
first  because the equity market returns in exceeded the assumptions in our dac estimation process  we recognized reduced dac amortization of million 
our level of dac amortization continues to be sensitive to equity market returns  since equity market returns affect our estimate of future gross profits from variable products 
to the extent that the return in any quarter is greater than the approximately percent assumed in our model  amortization is reduced  and vice versa 
excluding the effect  if any  from the gmdb hedging program and sop  see guaranteed minimum death benefits  we believe each percent variation from expected market appreciation will affect dac amortization and segment income by approximately million 
second  we recognized additional amortization of million  related to our former select and partners distribution channels 
we determined that the remaining dac asset related to our former select and partners channels exceeded the present value of total expected gross profits by million and million  respectively in accordingly  we recognized permanent impairments to our dac asset for these amounts 
allmerica financial annual report third  to facilitate our ongoing recoverability testing for the former partners and select distribution channels  we refined our methodology concerning the aggregation of annuity contracts for the purposes of estimating future gross profits and current amortization 
this refinement resulted in million of additional amortization in fourth  for all three distribution channels  we revised our estimate of persistency of variable annuity contracts 
overall  we now expect better persistency than we had anticipated previously in this is primarily the result of the significant decline in redemptions throughout although we had anticipated that redemptions would moderate throughout the year  the degree of decline in was greater than expected and caused us to change our persistency expectations 
this change resulted in a million decrease in dac amortization in changes in persistency  including changes resulting from our decision to cease retail sales through veravest as described previously  may continue to affect dac amortization in future periods 
fifth  we revised our estimate of policy maintenance costs for both our life insurance contracts and our annuity products 
this change resulted in million of additional amortization in finally  we revised our estimate related to certain fees from annuity products based on the current mix of business 
this change resulted in a million decrease in dac amortization in as a result of resetting the long term assumption for market related appreciation to percent annually and applying the reversion to the mean accounting methodology  we believe that dac amortization will be less sensitive to short term market movements 
additionally  we believe that our redemption levels will remain consistent with those experienced in therefore  we expect similar levels of dac amortization in future periods as experienced in we will continue to evaluate our process for estimating future gross profits and dac amortization 
these regular evaluations may result in future adjustments to dac amortization for a number of reasons  including permanent impairments to our dac asset if our actual experience is worse than our current assumptions 
impairments would increase dac amortization in the period that they are recognized 
guaranteed minimum death benefits the gmdb feature provides annuity contractholders with a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount 
this minimum amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract  the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate  the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary  or more typically  the greatest of these values 
if the gmdb is higher than the current account value at the time of death  we incur a cost equal to the difference 
as of december   the difference between the gmdb and the current account value the net amount at risk for all existing contracts was approximately billion  compared to approximately billion at december  the decrease was the result of an increase in equity market values during the year  as well as surrenders  which result in forfeitures of the gmdb benefit 
for each one percent increase or decrease in the s p index from december  levels  the net amount at risk is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately million to million 
to estimate the cost of the gmdb feature with respect to the profitability of the related insurance contract  we establish and apply various assumptions relating to the appreciation of related account assets  mortality and contract persistency  among other matters 
we regularly evaluate these assumptions to determine whether recent experience or anticipated trends merit adjustments to such assumptions 
the compounding effects of the significant market decline in  the ratings downgrades  increased annuity surrenders and related afs strategic business changes resulted in significantly decreased account values and persistency assumptions at september   which required us to reassess and increase our long term cost of gmdb assumptions 
we have a policy of providing reserves for gmdb based on our best estimate of the long term cost of gmdb 
as of september   we reassessed our expectation of the long term cost of gmdb in view of the then net amount at risk and revised persistency expectations  as well as the absence of additional deposits at the then current market levels 
this resulted in revised expectations of the long term cost of gmdb 
we calculated a reserve of million at september   and recognized this amount in policy benefits 
this was partially offset by a reduction in dac amortization of million 
it should be noted that including the aforementioned million reserve increase  the total provision for gmdb recognized in policy benefits during was million 
excluding the million reserve  gmdb expenses increased million to million in  as compared to million in these amounts were partially offset by reduced dac amortization of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our beginning and ending reserve for gmdb utilizing generally accepted accounting principles 
these reserves differ from the statutory gmdb reserves disclosed in the section allmerica financial annual report statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries  which are calculated using prescribed statutory accounting principles 
december in millions reserve for gmdb  beginning of year provision for gmdb claims from policyholders claims ceded to reinsurers claims  net of reinsurance gmdb reinsurance premiums paid reserve for gmdb  end of year claims ceded to reinsurers exclude those contracts with a date of death prior to december  and certain other claims 
we maintain a gmdb mortality reinsurance program covering the incidence of mortality on variable annuity policies 
we pay the reinsurers monthly premiums based on variable annuity net amount at risk in exchange for reimbursement of the net amount at risk portion of qualified cash claims 
we retain the market risk associated with the net amount at risk on the variable annuity business 
we will adopt in the first quarter of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop effective january  sop provides guidance for  among other items  determining liabilities for gmdb costs 
the determination of the gmdb reserve under sop is complex and requires various assumptions including  among other items  estimates of future market returns and expected contract persistency 
based on the equity market level as of december   we currently estimate that the impact of adopting sop will require us to record an additional million to million pre tax charge to earnings during the first quarter of  reflected in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
this reflects adjustments to both our gmdb reserve and our dac asset  as well as additional reserves required for our product features 
due to the inherent volatility of the reserve calculation required under sop  we are unable to estimate the annual gmdb expense for subsequent to the adoption of sop  changes in the reserve will continue to be included in segment income 
on december   we implemented a hedging program for our in force variable annuity policies with gmdb features 
the program s primary purpose is to provide us with an economic hedge against increased gmdb claims which could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  also  the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
however  it does not hedge or reduce our cost from the net amount at risk existing at december  we expect that the hedge program will partially offset the volatility associated with the gmdb reserve upon adoption of sop if the equity market declines  we believe that gains on the hedge derivatives will partially offset any increases in the gmdb reserve required under sop alternatively  if the equity market rises  we expect a decrease in the gmdb reserve to be partially offset by losses from the hedge derivatives 
however  we are uncertain as to the degree that the hedge program will partially offset the volatility associated with the gmdb reserve upon adoption of sop the program utilizes a dynamic hedging approach involving exchange traded futures contracts 
under the program  hedge contracts are expected to generate cash to fund increases in gmdb claims resulting from declines in the equity market 
in connection with the gmdb hedging program we incurred million in pre tax losses on the hedge contracts in these losses were partially offset by lower deferred acquisition cost amortization in these losses are the result of the increased equity market levels between december and december  in  these losses are included in losses gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income and are not included in segment income 
beginning january   the results of the gmdb hedge contracts will be included in segment income 
technology costs during  we recognized million of asset impairments related to technology used for our distribution of non proprietary products  reflected in other operating expenses 
during  we recognized million of asset impairments related to technology used in our variable annuity and variable universal life business  reflected in other operating expenses 
in light of the restructuring of our afs business  we concluded that expected future cash flows do not support continued capitalization of the entire cost of these technology assets 
accordingly  we recognized the aforementioned permanent impairments in other operating expenses 
annuity account values and redemptions the following table summarizes annuity account values and redemption activity for the afs segment  according to the three distribution channels we used prior to discontinuing sales of proprietary products in the fourth quarter of redemptions include both full policy and partial policy surrenders  withdrawals and death benefits to the extent equal to account value 
allmerica financial annual report in millions account values redemptions account values redemptions account values redemptions agency select partner total account values reflect market values as of january of the year indicated 
redemptions reflect annual activity for the year indicated 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we distributed our annuity products primarily through three distribution channels agency  which consisted of our former career agency force  select  which consisted of a network of third party broker dealers  and partners  which included distributors of the mutual funds advised by scudder investments  pioneer investment management  inc and delaware management company 
redemptions totaled billion in the fourth quarter of and billion in the first quarter of  driven largely by the actions affecting afs in  and averaged approximately million in the subsequent quarters of in addition  we could experience an increase in redemptions in our former agency channel as a result of our decision to cease retail sales through veravest and terminate the contracts of the registered representatives who constituted our former agency channel 
nevertheless  we believe that our current  overall dac assumptions include reasonable redemption levels 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ultimately redemptions will not differ from our assumptions 
therefore  dac amortization may be adversely affected in future periods 
life company segment income excluding certain non cash items in addition to our review of segment income  beginning in  we also utilize an alternative non gaap method of viewing this business and that of our asset management business 
we adjust the combined segment income for both afs and asset management for various non cash items 
we believe this measure allows for the review of the performance of this business based on the current cash operations 
in addition  this measure provides us with information regarding cash flows of this business that we can use in assessing the funding requirements to support these operations and any excess cash the business may be generating 
however  this measure does not reflect statutory earnings or increases in statutory surplus available to dividend from the life insurance companies 
in addition  all dividends from our life insurance companies are subject to regulatory approval see liquidity and capital resources on pages to of this annual report on form k and note dividend restrictions on page of this annual report on form k 
the following table provides a reconciliation of segment income to segment income excluding certain non cash items 
for the year ended december in millions allmerica financial services segment income asset management segment income deferred acquisition cost operating amortization  net property  plant and equipment depreciation veravest asset impairment statement of position amortization  net goodwill impairment change in guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves total segment income excluding certain non cash items we adjust segment income for dac because the cash payments related to the acquisition of the remaining business were made in prior years 
since we are no longer selling the products that generated these deferred costs  we do not expect any future cash payments associated with dac 
additionally  we adjust segment income for the change in our gmdb reserve because this change represents the difference between the cash gmdb payments and the related expense reflected in segment income 
the items excluded from segment income  including dac amortization  the change in our gmdb reserve  depreciation and amortization of certain assets  and asset impairments may be significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
segment income excluding certain non cash items  should not be construed as a substitute for segment income or net income determined in accordance with gaap

for the years ended december in millions interest margins on gics net investment income interest credited net interest margin premium financing business fees operating expenses net premium financing income fees and other income external internal other operating expenses segment income average gic deposits outstanding outstanding gic deposits  end of year compared to asset management segment income decreased million  or  to million during earnings in include a million loss related to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
excluding the effect of this loss  segment income would have decreased by million  or  primarily due to lower average gic deposits outstanding and the effect of replacing high yield investments with lower yielding  higher quality fixed income securities 
in addition  earnings from our external client asset management business decreased million  primarily due to reduced average assets under management  following the loss of one large institutional client 
ratings downgrades during see rating agency actions resulted in the termination of all remaining short term funding agreements  and ultimately  we ceased selling new long term funding agreements in furthermore  we retired some of our funding agreements at discounts during and in the fourth quarter of although these retirements resulted in gains for us see consolidated overview  income from the gic product line will be unfavorably affected in future periods due to the declining balance of outstanding gic deposits and lower interest spreads from the remaining gics resulting from investments in lower yielding securities 
excluding foreign currency fluctuations  we expect that net interest margins from gics will be modestly negative in in addition  we expect the lower income from our external client and asset management business to continue 
we use derivative instruments to hedge our gic portfolio see derivative instruments 
for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
in addition  some funding agreements are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we hedge this risk by entering into foreign exchange swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our net foreign currency exposure 
these hedges resulted in a million reduction in net investment income during  as compared to a million reduction in net investment income in  offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during both periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments was due to a decrease in average outstanding gic deposits and the associated hedges 
in addition  these hedges resulted in a million decrease in other income during  resulting from exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from futures contracts entered into in the fourth quarter of which were deemed ineffective hedges for accounting purposes 
in december  the ineffective futures contracts were replaced with foreign currency swaps  which are expected to be effective hedges for accounting purposes  thus we do not expect the fluctuations to recur in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses from ineffective hedges in the future 
compared to asset management segment income increased million  or  to million in primarily due to the inclusion of million of earnings related to our premium financing subsidiary  amgro  in  which was previously included in the property and casualty segment 
in addition  segment income increased due to an increase in fees and other income related to external clients  offset by lower earnings on gics 
new external assets under management resulted in an increase in earnings from asset management services provided to external clients 
earnings on gics decreased million primarily due to lower net investment income and to withdrawals of short term funding agreements 
net investment income declined primarily due to lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates  and to the effect of defaults on certain fixed maturities supporting gic obligations 
allmerica financial annual report as noted above  we use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and currency exchange risks related to our gic portfolio see derivative instruments 
these hedges resulted in a million reduction in net investment income during  as compared to a million reduction in net investment income during these reductions in net investment income were offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during the respective periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments was due to a decrease in average outstanding gic deposits and the associated hedges

approximately million of investment assets  with an amortized value of million  were used for this settlement see significant transactions sale of universal life insurance business 
in addition  investment assets  particularly fixed maturities  declined as a result of annuity redemptions from the general account in the afs segment and retirement of certain long term funding agreements in the asset management segment 
mortgage loans decreased million primarily due to increased prepayments and maturities of these investments  as well as our decision to discontinue investing new funds in these instruments 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised primarily of investment grade corporate securities  tax exempt issues of state and local governments  us government and agency securities and other issues 
based on ratings by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  investment grade securities comprised at december  and at december  of our total fixed maturity portfolio

the average yield on fixed maturities was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decline reflects lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates and an increased emphasis on purchasing higher credit quality fixed maturities during  as compared to we expect that the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates reflected in the current interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect our investment yield 
at december   million of our fixed maturities were invested in traditional private placement securities  as compared to million at december  fair values of traditional private placement securities are determined by either a third party broker or by internally developed pricing models  including the use of discounted cash flow analyses 
we recognized million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   principally resulting from our exposure to below investment grade securities 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the airline transportation sector  million related to the industrial sector  million related to securitized investments  and million related to the finance sector 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the communication sector  million related to the airline transportation sector  million related to the utility sector  million related to securitized investments  and million related to the energy sector 
in addition  we recognized million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of equity securities and other long term investments during  compared to million in in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
we apply these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive income 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have additional impairments in the future

we view the gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary as it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term 
furthermore  as of december   we had the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for this anticipated recovery in fair value 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and we would record a charge to earnings 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period  and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers

derivative instruments we enter into foreign currency swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts  to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposure on specific funding agreement liabilities 
we also entered into various types of interest rate swap contracts to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that were matched with fixed rate securities 
allmerica financial annual report on december   we implemented an economic hedging program involving exchange traded futures contracts to hedge against increased gmdb claims that could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  see allmerica financial services guaranteed minimum death benefits 
the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses as losses gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income as a result of this program 
the gmdb hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement no 
we recognized million of net realized losses on derivatives for the year ended december   million of losses for the year ended december  and million of losses for the year ended december  the realized losses during were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements  in response to the retirement of certain long term funding agreements at discounts 
the realized losses during were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements  during a declining interest rate environment  in response to short term funding agreement withdrawals and the retirement of certain long term funding agreements at discounts 
the realized losses during were primarily due to the termination of interest rate swap contracts in response to short term funding agreement withdrawals 
in  we managed the risk of cash flow variability on floating rate funding agreements that were matched with fixed rate securities  by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 which we adopted on january   the swap contracts were considered cash flow hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the floating rate funding agreements  including funding agreements with put features allowing the policyholder to cancel the contract prior to maturity 
we no longer have outstanding floating rate funding agreements with put features 
in addition  we no longer offer long term or short term funding agreements 
during  we reclassified losses of million to losses gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income from other comprehensive income related to payments that were not probable of occurring on ineffective interest rate swap contracts 
during  we reclassified these losses to realized investment gains losses from losses gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income 
these reclassifications  which occurred during the first and second quarters of  were due to the termination of interest rate swap contracts

we have developed an asset liability management approach tailored to specific insurance or investment product objectives 
the principal objective of our approach is to provide maximum levels of net investment income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitating our funding needs 
we manage our investment assets in over portfolio segments consistent with specific products or groups of products having similar liability characteristics 
as part of this approach  we develop investment guidelines for each portfolio consistent with the return objectives  risk tolerance  liquidity  time horizon  tax and regulatory requirements of the related product or business segment 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors  and in the case of mortgages  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry long term debt 
at december   we held mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of our holding company 
in accordance with statement no 
 the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities have been reclassified to long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  under this statement  reclassification of these instruments in prior periods was not permitted 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  with indices that correlate to balance sheet instruments to modify our indicated net interest sensitivity to levels we deem appropriate 
specifically  for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  we manage the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
additionally  we use exchange traded financial futures contracts to hedge against interest rate risk on the reinvestment of fixed maturities 
prior to september  we used exchange traded financial futures contracts to hedge against interest rate risk on anticipated gic sales and other funding agreements

sale of universal life insurance business historically  our afs segment offered fixed universal life insurance products through our former agency distribution channel see allmerica financial services for a description of our former distribution channels 
we sold substantially all of this business through a coinsurance agreement which was effective december  under the agreement  we ceded approximately million of universal life insurance reserves in exchange for the transfer of approximately million of investment assets with an amortized cost of approximately million 
at december   we recorded a loss from this transaction of million  net of taxes 
this loss consisted primarily of the aforementioned ceded reserves  asset transfers  a permanent impairment of the universal life deferred acquisition cost asset of million and administrative expenses of approximately million 
on a statutory accounting basis  this transaction produced an increase in statutory surplus of approximately million see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are those  which we believe  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
additional information about our significant accounting policies may be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies on pages to of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results property and casualty  overview of loss reserve estimation process based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  we develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions  which vary by line of business  used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
because the amount of the loss reserves is sensitive to our assumptions  we do not completely rely on only one estimate to determine our loss reserves 
we develop several estimates using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in various reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes and we adopt the best estimate 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we would adjust our reserves accordingly see segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions for further explanation of factors affecting our reserve estimates  our review process and our process for determining changes to our reserve estimates 
reserve allmerica financial annual report adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
property casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts see segment results property and casualty  reinsurance 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
variable products deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs  which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of insurance deposits 
acquisition costs related to our variable products variable universal life and variable annuities are recorded on the balance sheet and amortized through the income statement in proportion to total estimated gross profits over the expected life of the contracts see segment results allmerica financial services  deferred acquisition costs 
our estimated gross profits are based on assumptions including mortality  persistency  asset growth rates and expenses associated with policy maintenance 
the principal source of earnings for these policies is from asset based fees  which can vary in relation to changes in the equity market see segment results allmerica financial services  deferred acquisition costs   for a discussion on dac sensitivity to the equity market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the historical and expected future gross profits 
any adjustment in estimated profit requires that the amortization rate be revised retroactively to the date of policy annuity issuance 
the cumulative difference related to prior periods is recognized as a component of the current periods amortization  along with amortization associated with the actual gross profits of the period 
lower actual gross profits would typically result in less amortization expense 
the converse would also be true 
however  if lower gross profits were to continue into the future  a partial permanent impairment of the existing dac asset may occur 
we periodically review the dac asset to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
if dac is determined to be unrecoverable  such costs are expensed at the time of determination 
the amount of dac considered recoverable would be reduced in the near term if the estimate of ultimate or future gross profits is reduced 
we would revise the amount of dac amortization if any of the estimates discussed above were revised 
in addition  the disposition of a line of business can result in the permanent impairment of the related dac asset 
other than temporary impairments we employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all investments 
the methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process ensuring that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  general market conditions  the financial condition and prospects of the issuer s market and industry  and  our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we apply judgment in assessing whether the aforementioned factors have caused an other than temporary decline in value 
when an other than temporary decline in value is deemed to have occurred  we reduce the cost basis of the investment to fair value 
this reduction is permanent and is recognized as a realized investment loss see investment portfolio for further discussions regarding other than temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized loss position 
allmerica financial annual report statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital rbc 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the rbc ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital 
total adjusted capital for life insurance companies is defined as capital and surplus  plus asset valuation reserve  plus of dividends apportioned for payment 
total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus 
the company action level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital 
regulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various rbc action levels 
the various action levels are summarized as follows the company action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires the company to prepare and submit a rbc plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile 
a rbc plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the company action level 
after review  the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory 
the regulatory action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile a rbc plan  or if applicable  a revised rbc plan 
after examination or analysis  the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions to be taken 
the authorized control level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer 
the mandatory control level  which equals of the authorized control level  authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control ie rehabilitation or liquidation 
life and health companies whose total adjusted capital is between and of the authorized control level are subject to a trend test 
the trend test calculates the greater of the decrease in the margin between the current year and the prior year and the average of the past three years 
it assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
any company that trends below of the authorized control level ie demonstrates a negative trend would trigger the company action level 
as of december  and december   both afliac and faflic had adjusted capital levels well above of the authorized control level risk based capital and  therefore  were not subject to the trend test 
rbc ratios for regulatory purposes  as described above  are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the authorized control level the regulatory scale  however  in the insurance industry rbc ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the company action level without regard to the application of the negative trend test 
set forth below are statutory gmdb reserves  total adjusted capital and rbc ratios for our life insurance subsidiaries and for hanover  as applicable  as of december  and december   expressed both on the industry scale total adjusted capital divided by the company action level and regulatory scale total adjusted capital divided by authorized control level statutory gmdb reserves in millions  except ratios gross of reinsurance net of reinsurance total adjusted capital company action level authorized control level rbc ratio industry scale rbc ratio regulatory scale afliac faflic hanover afliac s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  faflic

hanover s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  citizens 
afliac statutory gmdb reserve balances exclude those reserves held by its subsidiary  faflic 
the total adjusted statutory capital position of our life companies showed significant improvement during increasing from million at december  to million at december  this increase is after the payment of a million dividend to the holding company  which was approved by the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  the massachusetts commissioner  and effected in december the improvement in our life insurance companies rbc reflects lower required risk based capital resulting from lower minimum pension liabilities  sales of high yield securities and lower required statutory gmdb reserves 
in addition  on december   we implemented a hedging program for our in force variable annuity policies with gmdb features 
the program s purpose is to provide us with an economic hedge against increased gmdb claims that could arise from declines in the equity market below levels at december  the program is expected to reduce the volatility in statutory capital and risk based capital levels from the effects of future equity market movements and allows us to retain most of the benefits of reduced gmdb costs in a rising equity market 
however  it does not hedge or reduce the cost of the gmdb at levels in effect as of december  on december   afliac  previously a delaware domiciled life insurance company  became a massachusetts domiciled life insurance company 
on december   afliac became a direct subsidiary of afc  as well as the immediate parent of faflic 
under the previous internal ownership structure  faflic was the immediate parent of afliac and a direct subsidiary of afc 
as a result of this internal reorganization  the statutory surplus of afliac substantially increased since it includes faflic s capital 
this allows for a greater tolerance of equity market volatility 
in turn  the statutory surplus of faflic substantially decreased since it no longer includes afliac s capital 
however  faflic s statutory surplus is no longer as susceptible to equity market volatility since afliac  which holds approximately of our annuity products that are most sensitive to changes in the equity market  is no longer consolidated into faflic 
afc has entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner in consideration of the decision not to write new business  whereby it will indefinitely maintain the rbc ratio of afliac at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
this agreement  which was previously with faflic  replaced an earlier commitment that faflic maintain a rbc ratio on the industry scale 
afc also entered into several transactions that significantly improved the statutory capital positions of both afliac and faflic as of december  these transactions include selling  through a coinsurance agreement  effective december   the fixed universal life insurance business which produced an increase in statutory surplus of approximately million 
in addition  faflic successfully completed a tender offer through which it retired additional long term funding agreements at amounts less than statutory accounting carrying values 
this transaction  together with open market repurchases of long term funding agreements in the fourth quarter  resulted in the retirement of approximately million of funding agreements at amounts below face value 
these actions produced a net increase in faflic s statutory surplus of approximately million 
during  afc made capital contributions to its then subsidiary faflic  which in turn contributed capital to its then subsidiary  afliac 
such contributions were necessary due to the negative impact on statutory surplus of increased sales commissions  the effect of declines in the equity market on gmdb reserves and an increased level of realized investment losses 
such contributions were also made in consideration of the ratings of the life companies and the rbc agreement described above  which has since been superseded 
for each contribution made  the amount was accrued as of the end of the prior quarter and was  therefore  reflected in the previous quarter s surplus balance in the corresponding company s statutory quarterly or annual statement 
hanover also paid an ordinary dividend to afc in july  allmerica financial annual report contributions pertaining to and were as follows date of contribution path of contribution amount effective date in millions february  afc to faflic december  faflic to afliac may  afc to faflic march  faflic to afliac july  hanover to afc july  august  afc to faflic june  faflic to afliac october  faflic to afliac september  january  afc to faflic december  faflic to afliac december  afliac to afc december  the effective date represents the date which these transactions were reflected in our statutory surplus balance 
we do not expect the life insurance subsidiaries to require levels of capital contributions from afc as in prior years due to the expectation of sufficient statutory capital and earnings  therefore  we do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend significant funds from our property and casualty companies to afc during see liquidity and capital resources 
the statutory surplus of the life companies  particularly afliac  which holds approximately of the annuity deposits with the gmdb feature  was highly sensitive to movements in the equity market 
this was due  in large part  to the required methodology for calculating gmdb actuarial guideline reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
as of december   the level of net gmdb reserves in the life companies is approximately million 
an increase of these reserves would not result directly in cash losses to us  but it would result in a reduction in statutory surplus 
in december  we implemented the aforementioned gmdb hedging program which significantly reduces our sensitivity to movements in the equity market 
the dac amortization adjustments described earlier do not have an impact on statutory surplus  as dac is not a concept recognized under statutory accounting principles 
afliac entered into a reinsurance agreement  in  with an independent reinsurer  to cede up to million of its gmdb costs annually based upon contract date  in excess of million  for a three year period 
as described under liquidity and capital resources below  afc entered into a related agreement to reimburse costs incurred by this independent reinsurer 
the above mentioned agreement was superseded by the implementation of a gmdb mortality reinsurance program 
effective december   the life companies entered into a mortality reinsurance program with unaffiliated reinsurers covering the incidence of mortality on variable annuity policies 
this transaction reduced required statutory net gmdb reserves and resulted in an increase in statutory capital and surplus of approximately million for the life companies at december  for the year ended december   the life companies incurred gmdb costs of million  and ceded million of gmdb costs under the aforementioned reinsurance programs 
in addition  for the year ended december   the life companies incurred gmdb costs of million  and ceded million of gmdb costs under the aforementioned gmdb mortality reinsurance program 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends be paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus and restrictions on the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined 
as mentioned above see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries  we entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner  in consideration of the decision not to write new life insurance and annuity business  whereby we will indefinitely maintain the rbc ratio of afliac at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
during  we received no dividends from our property and casualty businesses 
approximately million is currently available to dividend from our property and casualty allmerica financial annual report companies without prior approval from the insurance commissioners in the states of domicile 
with permission from the massachusetts commissioner  our holding company  afc  received a million dividend from afliac in the fourth quarter of further dividends from afliac would require consent from the massachusetts commissioner 
in  afliac entered into an agreement to cede a portion of its gmdb obligations to an independent reinsurer see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries 
under a related agreement  afc agreed to reimburse these costs to the reinsurer 
this agreement was terminated on march  in  afliac did not cede any related gmdb costs prior to march   and  likewise  no reimbursements were made by afc 
in  afliac incurred gmdb costs of approximately million 
since  afliac ceded million under the agreement  of which afc reimbursed million through december due to the aforementioned termination of this agreement  we do not expect any related future reimbursements 
sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries are from premiums and fees collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  while net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash during primarily reflects net payments from the general account as a result of continued increased annuity contract withdrawals in the afs segment as a result of ratings downgrades and our decision to cease new sales 
in addition  approximately million of cash was transferred as a result of the sale of our universal life insurance business 
additionally  we contributed million to our qualified pension plan 
in  we received approximately million in funds which were held with a third party reinsurer  that in were disbursed to its successor 
this payment related to funds held for the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract as a result of the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions 
in  these funds were returned to us due to the improvement in our financial strength ratings 
the decrease in cash during primarily reflects net payments from the general account as a result of increased annuity contract withdrawals in the afs segment as a result of ratings downgrades and our decision to cease new sales 
additionally  premium collections in the property and casualty business decreased  principally due to timing of cash receipts 
these net cash outflows were partially offset by decreased loss and lae payments in the property and casualty business  as well as increased federal income tax refunds 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and billion in and  respectively  while net cash used in investing activities was billion in the billion decrease in cash provided by investing activities in  compared to  resulted primarily from lower net sales of fixed maturities and equity securities  partially offset by an increase in cash provided from derivative activity 
compared to  net sales of fixed maturities and equity securities were unusually high in due to elevated levels of funding agreement withdrawals in the asset management segment and general account annuity redemptions in afs 
the billion increase in cash provided by investing activities in resulted primarily from net sales of fixed maturities 
the increase in net sales of fixed maturities in was primarily a result of short term funding agreement withdrawals and the retirement of certain long term funding agreements in the asset management segment  as well as payments made related to general account annuity redemptions in the afs segment 
net cash used in financing activities was million and billion in and  respectively  while net cash provided by financing activities was million in the billion decrease in cash used in is primarily due to lower net funding agreement withdrawals  including withdrawals from trust instruments supported by funding obligations 
the decrease in cash provided in is primarily due to these net funding agreement withdrawals  as well as the extinguishment of our short term debt obligation totaling million 
additionally  during  we transferred approximately million of investment assets and million of cash to settle payables related to the sale of our universal life insurance business 
at december   our holding company held million of cash and investments 
historically  funds provided to the holding company were from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
however  a million dividend from our life insurance subsidiaries was paid to the holding company as of december  we believe our holding company has the ability to meet its obligations through the remainder of  consisting primarily of interest on the senior debentures and capital securities 
therefore  we currently do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend funds from the property and casualty companies in in order to fund holding company obligations 
in and  we did not pay an annual dividend 
we expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements 
our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high allmerica financial annual report degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity investments  common stock and short term investments 
in addition  we had no commercial paper borrowings as of december  and we do not anticipate utilizing commercial paper in debt ratings downgrades resulted in the non renewal of our credit line and continue to preclude or adversely affect the cost and availability of credit lines  commercial paper  other additional debt and equity financing see rating agency actions 
our financing obligations generally include debt  repayment of our capital securities also classified as debt  operating lease payments  trust instruments supported by funding obligations and funding agreements

contingencies on july   an action captioned american national bank and trust company of chicago  as trustee f b o emerald investments limited partnership  and emerald investments limited partnership v 
allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company was commenced in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division 
in  plaintiffs purchased two variable annuity contracts with initial premiums of million each 
plaintiffs  who afliac identified as engaging in frequent transfers of significant sums between sub accounts that in its opinion constituted market timing  were subject to restrictions upon such trading that afliac imposed in in december  the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs  holding that at least certain restrictions imposed on their trading activities violated the terms of the annuity contracts 
the court ordered limited discovery regarding the plaintiffs attempts to trade following dissemination of the trading restrictions 
we have filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification of the court s partial summary judgment opinion 
other than the limited discovery ordered by the court  no discovery in the case has ensued to date  and it is too early in the proceedings for us to assess the amount of potential damages if afliac should ultimately be unsuccessful in defending this lawsuit 
plaintiffs allege that such restrictions constitute a breach of the terms of the annuity contracts and seek unspecified damages  including lost profits and prejudgment interest 
the outcome is not expected to be material to our financial position  although it could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
we have been named a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business and are involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies

rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security

in the fourth quarter of  we secured third party guarantees and established a special commission program  in an effort to minimize the loss of commercial lines business as a result of the downgrades 
expenses incurred as a result of purchasing third party guarantees in were million 
in addition  we incurred million in additional commission expenses related to the special commission program 
these expenses are expected to decrease to million combined in due to our am best rating upgrade

these downgrades also caused counterparties to terminate certain swap agreements  which were replaced with alternative derivative instruments 
although we do not expect downgrades in our ratings  there can be no assurance that current ratings or downgrades that could occur would not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position
