item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and risk factors included above in item of this annual report on form k 
overview our financial and operational improvement for the year ended december  was influenced by several significant factors i a focus in on supporting our partners in their commercial and development endeavors and the elimination of our direct sales force  ii expense control primarily resulting from the sale of our rules based medicine research and development project rbm and the fourth quarter restructure  iii a strengthening of our contractual relationships with our partners and suppliers  and iv completion of the strategic study in the spring of beginning with the restructuring in and continuing throughout  we changed from a dual focus of partner assistance and direct sales to one of only partner assistance 
our strategy of increasing the assistance we provided to our partners in their commercial and development endeavors coupled with the discontinuation of our direct sales efforts enabled our partners to focus on commercialization and avert concerns that we were going to compete directly with them 
we believe that this adjustment coupled with the maturation of our technology in the marketplace contributed significantly to the growth that we experienced during our top five customers in contributed million in total revenue and primarily as a result of this change  contributed million for additionally  several partners who were relatively insignificant contributors in increased their collective contribution over tenfold to million for in september of  we sold our rbm research and development project resulting in a person reduction in headcount 
for all of the year ended december  we expended approximately million on the rbm project  none of which repeated during additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our headcount by a further employees  restructured the organizational hierarchy and reduced our leased occupancy footage 
total costs of the reorganization were approximately million  all incurred in the fourth quarter of and none of which repeated during furthermore  based on an impairment evaluation of the rules based medicine  inc investment at december   we determined that the investment should be fully impaired at a cost of approximately million 
these items combined resulted in a reduction in the net loss by approximately million in relative to a significant amount of effort was expended during both solidifying our contractual relationships with our partners and putting supply agreements in place with key suppliers 
as the commercialization efforts of our partners increased throughout the year and opportunities were afforded to modify the contracts with them we strengthened our contractual positions by including minimum purchase requirements 
these requirements served to encourage our partner s allocation of resources to development and commercialization of the technology and enhance our ability to predict revenue patterns 
secondly  we were able to execute supplier agreements with our key suppliers to ensure a flexible supply of raw materials to better meet our demands  while limiting our exposure to supply failures 
we also identified alternate supply sources for several key components 
in addition to these operational measures  we completed the strategic study commenced in the fall of the results of the study provided valuable information regarding target market opportunities and the size of those market segments 
we have focused our resources and adjusted our strategies and tactics towards the identified segments  which should provide growth opportunities for the company 
the result of the aforementioned factors have all contributed significantly to our bottom line improvement for for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we currently expect to continue experiencing quarterly net losses and anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future as a result of several factors  including the risks discussed in this report under the heading risk factors 
our limited operating history  customer concentration and continued fluctuations in buying patterns of our strategic partners make accurate predictions of future operations difficult 

table of contents our ability to achieve sustained profitability continues to depend upon our ability to establish meaningful and successful strategic partnership arrangements with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
strategic partners will develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers generating royalties for us 
strategic partners may also perform testing services for third parties using our technology that will result in royalties for us 
some strategic partners will also buy our products and then resell those products to their customers 
at december   we had strategic partners who had either released commercialized products based on the luminex platform or were redistributing our products and were reporting royalties 
these strategic partners constituted of total revenues for finally  we completed without hiring a successor to tom erickson  our interim chief executive officer 
we believe mr 
erickson has been and continues to be an effective leader in focusing our management team on fundamental improvements to our company s strategy and operations 
in september  the company engaged a second search firm to assist in the search for a new chief executive officer 
the results of the strategic study completed in the spring of coupled with a refinement of focus of efforts should provide a more concise framework from which to identify qualified candidates 
we currently anticipate we will hire a new chief executive officer in and hope to do so promptly 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
total deferred revenue as of december  was million and consisted of i unamortized license fees for non exclusive licenses and patent rights to certain luminex technologies in the amount of million  ii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments in the amount of million  iii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts in the amount of  and iv payments received for sales to customers with rights of return that had not yet expired in the amount of  upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
at december   there were two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
first  the company has a specific reserve for inventory components that we no longer use in the manufacture of our systems 
second  we have a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
the company believes that its inventory is properly valued based on current market conditions 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a deterioration in the economic environment  in 
table of contents general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts

table of contents year ended december  system sales consumable sales royalty revenue service contracts other revenue system and peripheral component sales increased to million in from million in system placements increased to in from in bringing the installed base of systems to  as of december  the increase in system placements is primarily the result of commercial launches by several of our partners and an intensification of efforts by other partners that were previously commercial 
additionally  we believe the elimination of our direct sales force and assistance to our partners in their development and commercialization efforts allayed fears of direct competition with us 
for the year ended december  four of our partners individually accounted for or greater of total system placements and collectively accounted for of our luminex system sales of systems 
consumable sales  comprised of microspheres and sheath fluid  increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of the increased installed base of commercial luminex systems as compared to the prior year 
during the year  we had bulk purchases totaling approximately million as compared with bulk purchases totaling approximately million in we define bulk purchases as purchases of microspheres or sheath fluid by an individual strategic partner in a single quarter that in the aggregate are more than  royalty revenue increased to million in from  in this increase is attributable to increased sales of royalty bearing commercial products by our partners and an increase in the commercial base of luminex systems as compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   we had commercial partners report royalties as compared with for the year ended december  the partners for whom we recognized  of royalties in represented approximately million of the royalties  an increase of approximately over their prior year payments 
four of our partners reported royalties totaling approximately  or of the total royalties for service contracts  comprised of extended warranty contracts earned ratable over the term of the agreement  increased to million in from  in this increase is attributable to the increased sales of extended warranty contracts  which is a result of the increase in the commercial base of luminex systems as compared to the prior year 
other revenues  comprised of training revenue  shipping revenue  miscellaneous parts sales  amortized license fees and other special project revenue  increased to million in from  in this increase is primarily the result of increased miscellaneous part sales to our partners that perform service work on luminex systems that are outside the company s standard one year warranty period 
gross margin percentage 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in this increase is primarily attributable to two factors i reductions in our fixed costs as part of the restructuring efforts undertaken by the company in and the allocation of our remaining fixed costs over a higher revenue base and ii gross margin in was adversely affected by the inclusion of costs associated with the cancellation or delay of inventory items no longer used in production and a charge taken to allow for slow moving inventory 
our production schedule was adjusted during that period to reflect a lower expected rate of system orders 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million in from million in as a result of the one time business restructuring charge of million incurred in  the elimination of expenses related to rbm as of september of million and reduced operations costs following the business restructuring 
a breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended december  and is as follows 
table of contents year ended december  research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses business restructuring charges research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the effects of our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of and to the elimination of expenditures related to rbm as of september rbm research and development expenses totaled approximately million in specific components contributing to this net decrease  exclusive of the elimination of rbm expenditures in  were a reduction in research and development personnel costs of  and a reduction in professional fees of  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to our restructuring and cost control efforts and included reduced personnel costs of approximately million  a decrease in stock compensation expense of million  reductions in travel  entertainment and marketing expenses of  and other reductions of approximately  stock compensation expense of million in was primarily related to the sale of our rbm business unit 
the business restructuring charges taken during the fourth quarter of totaled million and were comprised of i approximately million in personnel related costs associated with the reduction in force and ii approximately  associated with the early termination of a real estate lease for expansion space no longer needed for our operations 
in connection with the lease termination  we reduced our leased space in austin  texas from  to  square feet 
future savings  as a result of the business restructuring  are anticipated to be approximately million per year in personnel related costs and approximately  per year through in facility related expenditures 
during  we incurred cash expenditures totaling approximately million and non cash and other charges of approximately  related to our business restructuring 
as of december   the company has completed the business restructuring plan and no other expenditures are expected 
non recurring items 
there were non recurring items related to settlement of litigation in and to impairment of our rules based medicine  inc investment in as a result of a procedural omission  the company is unable to pursue a patent in japan  which corresponds to some of the company s issued us patents related to the company s method of real time detection and quantification of multiple analytes from a single sample 
on january   the company filed a lawsuit in travis county  texas state district court alleging negligence and breach of contract on the part of former patent counsel 
on march   the parties executed a full  final and complete release regarding such action  without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants 
as consideration in connection with the settlement and release  the company received approximately million  net of legal and related costs and expenses 
as a result  this was a one time benefit that further reduced the net loss for on september   the company transferred assets related to rbm  consisting of cash  property and equipment with a fair value of approximately million  to rules based medicine  inc  a newly formed company headed by the company s former chairman  chief executive officer and co founder 
the company periodically analyzed its strategic investment for impairment considered other than temporary 
in performing its analysis on this strategic investment  the company first evaluated whether general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  or specific information pertaining to the investment s industry or the individual entity  indicated that a decline in value that is other than temporary had occurred 
then the company considered specific factors  including the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment  any specific events that may affect the investee company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   based upon current estimates of future cash flow  current market conditions and current profitability  the company made the decision to 
table of contents permanently impair the strategic investment 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized million in impairment charges for the year ended december   and such amount is recorded as impairment of investment in the consolidated statements of operations 
net loss 
the net loss decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net loss in is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue  the increase in gross margin percentage  the decrease in operating expenses discussed above  the proceeds from settlement of litigation in without the investment impairment charge taken in year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  variance revenue gross margin percentage operating expenses net loss revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of decreases in instrumentation revenue 
instrumentation revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in instrumentation revenue was primarily attributable to slower than anticipated commercial rollouts by our partners that became commercial in the last half of because of the unanticipated slowness of the commercialization process  our partners were not required to replenish inventory as quickly resulting in reduced system sales 
the following table summarizes the number of system sales for compared with year ended december  luminex systems luminex hts systems consumable sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of  or 
consumable sales  exclusive of large purchases by a strategic partner during that did not recur at the same rate in  increased to million in from million in  an increase of the increase in consumable sales largely was attributable to the increase in the installed base of instruments 
service contract revenue increased during to  from  during the increase is attributable to an increased number of systems under contract in as compared to the prior year period

business restructuring charges 
the business restructuring charges taken during the fourth quarter of totaled million and were comprised of i approximately million in personnel related costs associated with the reduction in force and ii approximately  associated with the early termination of a real estate lease for expansion space no longer needed for our operations 
in connection with the lease termination  we reduced our leased space in austin  texas from  to  square feet 
future savings  as a result of the business restructuring  are anticipated to be approximately million per year in personnel related costs and approximately  per year through in facility related expenditures

other income  net 
other income decreased by million to  in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average investment yields in compared with and a reduction in the cash and short term investment balances 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards begin to expire in  if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards will be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the periods indicated in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic loss per share quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic loss per share 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and working capital positions were essentially unchanged as we held cash and cash equivalents of million and had working capital of million  as compared with million and million  respectively  at december  we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities 
cash used in operations was million in  compared with million in the reduction in net cash used in operations  in conjunction with a million net loss in  primarily reflects a decrease in net inventory of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
purchases of property and equipment in totaled  compared with million in in the first quarter of  we settled a pending lawsuit and entered into a full  final and complete release with the defendant  without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants 
as consideration for the settlement and release  the company received approximately million  net of legal and related costs and expenses 
this cash infusion coupled with receipt of million in option exercise proceeds helped offset losses from operations 
additionally  we received approximately million in nonrefundable license fees from strategic partners during these license fees are amortized into income over the life of the agreement 
we have non cancellable purchase commitments with certain of our component suppliers 
should our production requirements fall below the level of our commitments  we could be required to take delivery of inventory for which we have no immediate need or incur an increased cost per unit going forward 
we are not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements 
however  because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
the effort to manage our inventory  coupled with sales during  placed a constraint on our ability to adequately and timely produce systems for sale 
we have taken steps to increase our manufacturing capacity  primarily by increasing the size of our component orders  in response to the increase in demand for our systems 
while we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand  to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates  we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity  which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period 
should the company s need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in thousands thereafter total non cancellable rental obligations non cancellable purchase obligations anticipated liquidity impact as of december  purchase obligations do not extend beyond a year  however  we would expect future years to have purchase commitments which will arise in the ordinary course of business and will generally increase or decrease according to increases or decreases  respectively  in overall sales volume 

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the status of competitive products 
additionally  actions taken based on recommendations from our strategic consulting study could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our current operating expenses and capital requirements through based upon our current operational structure  management anticipates total cash use for to be approximately to million  giving us an anticipated balance at december  of to million 
this range of net cash reduction of is primarily dependent upon the loss from operations during offset by proceeds if any from option exercises throughout the year 
we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies and to fund operations 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on potentially unattractive terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income received on our cash balances is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since our investments are in instruments that meet the definition of cash equivalents and are held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to the nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency market risk is limited
