item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section addresses material aspects of noven s financial condition and results of operations 
the contents of this section include an overview of noven and our relationship with novartis and our joint venture  novogyne  the production issues that we experienced in  and methypatch  our methylphenidate patch for the treatment of adhd  an analysis of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources  a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the application of our critical accounting policies  an outlook that includes our current financial guidance and certain factors that we believe may influence our financial results in  and a discussion of forward looking statements used in this report and a review of cautionary factors that could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
overview we develop and manufacture advanced transdermal patches and presently derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of transdermal patches for use in menopausal hormone therapy 
in the united states  our ht products are marketed and sold by novogyne  the joint venture that we formed with novartis in in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  our ht products are marketed and sold by novartis pharma  an affiliate of novartis 
a detailed discussion of the novogyne joint venture and our several licensing arrangements with novartis and novartis pharma is included in this overview section under novartis and novogyne 
the market for ht products  including our transdermal ht products  has contracted since the july publication of the whi study results 
comparing the second quarter of the quarter immediately preceeding the whi study to the fourth quarter of  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states declined by 
for the same period  aggregate prescriptions for noven s united states products decreased 
the estrogen segment of the ht market in the united states declined  while our vivelle family decreased 
vivelle dot  which represented of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  increased from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of we believe vivelle dot prescriptions have benefited from patient conversions from original vivelle 
at the end of  the vivelle family held a share of total estrogen patch prescriptions  compared to a share at the end of the second quarter of in  our vivelle dot estrogen patch became the most frequently dispensed estrogen patch in its market segment 
we believe this is due in part to the beneficial wear characteristics made possible by our technology 
us prescriptions for combipatch which represented approximately of our total us prescriptions in the fourth quarter of declined from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  while prescriptions for the total united states market for fixed combination hormone therapy declined 
whi involved an oral combination estrogen progestin product and  accordingly  that segment of the ht market has experienced the most significant decline 
as noted above  prescriptions for our combipatch combination estrogen progestin patch  like most combination ht therapies  have declined significantly since whi 
further declines for combipatch could require novogyne which holds the combipatch marketing rights to record an impairment loss related to the combipatch marketing rights  which would harm both our and novogyne s results of operations 
see critical accounting policies investment in novogyne 

table of contents notwithstanding the decreased size of the ht market post whi studies  we remain committed to the ht business and it remains profitable for us 
in  we generated profits for the fifth consecutive year 
we recognized net income of million in compared to million in and million in our revenues declined in compared to due primarily to the lower prescription trends following the whi study 
our revenues in were also adversely affected by an increased allowance for returns of million related to the product recalls that we experienced in see production issues below for additional information on the product recalls 
an important part of our business strategy is to seek to diversify our product offerings beyond the ht market through strategic collaborations and new product developments 
since the beginning of  we have entered into the following new collaborations shire licensed our methypatch product for adhd  p gp engaged us to develop new prescription patches in the area of hypoactive sexual desire disorder  and endo licensed our developmental fentanyl patch 
novartis and novogyne our business  financial position and results of operations currently depend on the joint venture  novogyne  that we formed with novartis to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states 
novogyne markets our three principal ht products vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch in the united states 
in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  we have licensed the marketing rights to these products to novartis pharma  which is an affiliate of novartis 
in most of these markets  vivelle is marketed under the brand name menorest  vivelle dot is marketed under the brand name estradot and combipatch is marketed under the brand name estalis 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds a equity interest 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we manufacture and supply vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch to novogyne  perform marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receive royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of the et products 
novartis distributes vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne 

table of contents novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
after the annual preferred return to novartis  our share of novogyne s income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
our share of novogyne s income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
any cash we receive from novogyne is in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  the amount of cash that we receive from novogyne in any period may not be the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million in distributions from novogyne  which accounted for a substantial portion of our net cash flows provided by operating activities for these periods 
we re invested the distributions that we received in from novogyne  plus an additional million  in novogyne to fund our portion of the payments associated with the combipatch license transaction 
we expect that a significant portion of our earnings and cash flow for the next several years will be generated through our interest in novogyne  but we cannot assure that novogyne will continue to be profitable or make cash distributions 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
novogyne acquired the exclusive united states marketing rights to combipatch in march in a series of transactions involving novogyne  noven  novartis and aventis 
in the transaction  novogyne paid aventis million at closing  plus an additional million  which was due in four quarterly installments of million  with the final payment made in march as a consequence of the transaction and under the terms of our existing license agreement with aventis  we received million from aventis  which amount was deferred and recognized as license revenues over ten years beginning in the first quarter of since the publication of the ht studies  prescriptions for combipatch have declined substantially 
novogyne recorded the acquisition of combipatch marketing rights at cost and  at december   this asset had a net book value of million 
novogyne tests this asset for impairment on a periodic basis 
any further adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in its combipatch marketing rights  which could require novogyne to record an impairment loss 
impairment of that asset would adversely affect novogyne s  and consequently our  operating results and could  depending on the size of the impairment  result in a loss at both the novogyne and noven level for the period in which the impairment occurred 
under the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing novogyne with financial  accounting  legal and regulatory services  including monitoring inventory levels 
in late  inventory levels at novogyne exceeded then current and expected demand  which negatively affected our sales and results of operations in the first half of as novogyne curtailed product shipments to its trade customers  and we reduced shipments to novogyne based on demand 

table of contents in november  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with novartis pharma pursuant to which we granted novartis pharma the right to market vivelle dot under the name estradot in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan 
we received a million license payment upon execution of the agreement 
for accounting purposes  the payment was deferred and is being recognized as license revenues over years beginning in the fourth quarter of we subsequently received a million milestone payment in the fourth quarter of that is being recognized as license revenues beginning in the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of  which is the end of the estimated product life cycle 
under the terms of the agreement  novartis pharma is responsible for seeking approval to market estradot in its territories 
the product has been approved for marketing in over foreign countries and the regulatory authorities of other countries are reviewing novartis registration applications 
novartis pharma has launched the product in germany  spain without government reimbursement and a number of smaller countries 
however  novartis pharma has informed us that pricing  government reimbursement and product labeling issues are adversely impacting its launch plans in many countries  including the united kingdom  france and italy 
accordingly  we cannot assure that novartis pharma will be successful in effecting additional registrations of estradot or that novartis pharma will launch estradot in any particular country 
the profitability of estradot and our other products sold in the european union may also be negatively affected by parallel trade practices whereby a licensed importer may take advantage of price disparity between markets by purchasing our products in a market with a relatively lower price and then importing them into a country with a relatively higher price 
novartis pharma markets several other transdermal ht products in addition to our products  which may limit the efforts novartis pharma devotes to our products 
in some countries  including the united kingdom and france  novartis pharma is seeking a marketing partner to launch the product but to date has been unsuccessful 
we cannot assure that novartis pharma will be successful in securing a marketing partner or in launching estradot in those countries 
it can be expected that sales by novartis pharma of menorest  our first generation transdermal estrogen system  will be negatively affected if and as novartis pharma increases sales of estradot  our second generation transdermal estrogen system 
novartis pharma also holds the rights to market estalis  our combination estrogen progestin patch product  outside of the united states and japan 
estalis is presently approved in only one dosage strength in most european countries 
novartis pharma has filed an application for approval of a second dosage strength in sweden 
novartis pharma  however  believes that  in light of the market changes since the publication of the ht studies  the product will not be successful in europe without a dosage strength lower than the second dosage strength 
as a consequence  novartis pharma has advised us that  in lieu of launching the second dosage strength of estalis  they intend to seek marketing approval and commercialization of a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch product with a lower dosage strength 
no assurance can be given that approval will be obtained  and the timing of any launch of a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch product cannot be predicted 
we expect that growth in this market will be limited unless a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch product is approved and launched  and we cannot assure that the product will be successful even if a lower dosage strength combination product is approved and launched 
for the reasons discussed above  we do not expect european sales of estradot or estalis to contribute growth in production issues in in  our product stability testing program revealed that certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot did not maintain required specifications throughout the products shelf lives  resulting in product recalls 
revenues for are net of approximately million and million in allowances for returns at noven and novogyne  respectively  related to the recalls 
in addition  our marketing  selling and administrative expenses in include  in estimated costs associated with these recalls 

table of contents the combipatch issue resulted from a previously disclosed production issue related to a problematic raw material supplied by one vendor 
this issue caused us to temporarily suspend shipments of combipatch to novogyne in the first quarter  and caused novartis to recall one lot of combipatch in july since identifying the issue  we have been monitoring all lots of combipatch product manufactured with the problematic material 
even though interim testing indicated that these additional lots were expected to maintain specifications throughout their shelf lives  we experienced an unexpected stability failure in one additional lot 
in light of this event  novartis initiated a recall of all lots of combipatch product remaining in distribution that were potentially affected by this problematic raw material 
after addressing the issues with the particular raw material  we continue to manufacture and ship combipatch to novogyne and there was no interruption of trade supplies 
we are working to identify the root cause of the vivelle dot issue  and in the interim have initiated more rigorous testing of vivelle dot and estradot product 
in october  a quantity of vivelle dot tested out of specification 
in november  an additional quantity tested out of specification 
novartis has announced a recall of the vivelle dot product that tested out of specification in october and november we have identified additional product that demonstrates adverse stability trends but remains within required specifications 
based on results of our testing and analysis to date  we do not believe that any additional vivelle dot product that is currently in distribution or in our inventory is unlikely to maintain required stability 
we have established allowances for estimated sales returns for product that has been recalled as a result of testing out of specification 
novogyne has increased its allowance for sales returns in light of the same issue 
if a root cause determination or additional testing indicates that the production issue affects more product than our current testing and analysis suggests  additional recalls may be required  our allowances may prove insufficient and or we may be forced to suspend shipping 
if we are unable to ship vivelle dot and or estradot  novogyne and or novartis would be unable to supply its customers  which would result in lost sales and potentially lost market share  and our results of operations and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
methypatch we have developed a once daily transdermal methylphenidate delivery system for the treatment of adhd  which is intended to be marketed under the trade name methypatch 
we filed an nda with the fda in june in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement to license the exclusive global rights to market methypatch to shire for payments of up to million and ongoing manufacturing revenues 
consideration for the transaction is as follows i million was paid upon closing of the transaction in april  ii million is payable upon receipt of final marketing approval for methypatch by the fda  and iii three installments of million each are payable upon shire s achievement of million  million and million in annual net sales of methypatch  respectively 
shire s annual net sales will be measured quarterly on a trailing month basis  with each milestone payment due days after the end of the first quarter during which trailing month sales exceed the applicable threshold 
shire has agreed that it will not sell any other product containing methylphenidate as an active ingredient until the earlier of i five years from the closing date or ii payment of all of the sales milestones 
on the closing date  we entered into a long term supply agreement under which we expect to manufacture and supply methypatch to shire 
the agreement gives shire the right to qualify a second manufacturing source and purchase a portion of its requirements from the second source 
if shire were to exercise this right  noven s revenues from sales of methypatch would be adversely affected 
pursuant to the agreement  under certain circumstances shire has the right to require us to repurchase the product rights for million 

table of contents in april  we received a not approvable letter from the fda relating to our methypatch nda 
a not approvable letter is issued if the fda does not consider the application approvable because one or more deficiencies in the application preclude the fda from approving it 
the letter cited clinical and other issues as the basis for non approval 
in october  we submitted with shire a jointly prepared  proposed study protocol for an additional clinical study for methypatch to the fda for review and comment 
the purpose of this additional proposed study was to address clinical issues and risks raised in the fda s not approvable letter 
in november  the fda responded to our proposed study protocol and reported that the proposed study design did not address the clinical risk benefit issues raised in the april not approvable letter 
in its november response  the fda provided specific recommendations regarding the proposed study design 
noven and shire are working together to review and respond to the fda s comments and recommendations with respect to the study design 
we believe this study is necessary to amend the nda and that other studies may also be required or advisable 
under a november agreement with shire  if we agree with shire on a study design  shire will manage the new clinical study and we will fund it 
under our agreement with shire  we are responsible for providing the clinical supplies for the study and we may also incur certain additional expenses in pursuit of regulatory approval  including all or a portion of the cost of any other studies we decide to conduct 
at the conclusion of the trial  if shire determines that submission of the study results to the fda would not result in a commercially viable product  shire will have the right to terminate the original transaction agreement 
if shire exercises its termination right under these circumstances  however  shire will forfeit its right to require us to repurchase the product rights  and the product rights will revert to us without payment to shire 
if shire elects to proceed after reviewing the study results  we expect to cooperate with shire in submitting the new study results to the fda and continuing to seek regulatory approval of methypatch 
we cannot assure that any revised study design will be acceptable to the fda or  even if accepted by the fda  produce study results that will result in a commercially viable product 
if the parties are unable to reach agreement with each other or the fda on a study design  the parties may not continue to pursue regulatory approval of methypatch 
of the million received from shire at closing  million has been deferred and is expected to be recognized as license revenues over time beginning when shire s right to require us to repurchase methypatch rights expires 
a portion of the remaining million was recognized as revenues in the second quarter using a year amortization period  which is the estimated product life cycle 
beginning in the third quarter  we ceased amortization of the balance of the million due to the planned initiation of an additional clinical trial and the significant costs expected to be incurred in pursuing methypatch approval 
we are committed to continuing to seek regulatory approval for methypatch for as long as it remains a commercially practicable strategy 
we have determined that we cannot yet estimate the total cost of seeking methypatch approval  but we do not expect the total cost to exceed the deferred revenue balance of million as of december  we expect to defer direct expenses incurred in pursuit of methypatch regulatory approval including the cost of any clinical studies against the deferred revenue balance 
license revenues deferred under this arrangement will be recorded net of direct expenses incurred in pursuing regulatory approval 
once we can estimate our expected total cost in obtaining regulatory approval  we expect to recognize any unused portion of the deferred revenue balance over the remainder of the initial year period 
the accounting treatment of amounts received from shire would be expected to change if shire were to exercise its right to require us to repurchase the product rights or if methypatch development were abandoned 
in either of these scenarios  noven would expect to recognize the remaining deferred license revenue immediately into income in the period of exercise or abandonment  net of the million repurchase price 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change product revenues novogyne product sales royalties product revenues third parties product sales royalties total product revenues license and contract revenues contract license net revenues net revenues as described in more detail below  the decline in revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to lower unit sales for both our us and international products  as well as approximately million in allowances for returns related to product recalls 
as described in more detail below  the increase in revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales to novogyne for all products  increased unit sales of estradot to novartis pharma  and increased contract revenues 
these increases were partially offset by lower unit sales of combipatch to aventis  lower unit sales of estalis to novartis pharma and lower minimum fee payments related to sales of menorest 
product revenues novogyne product revenues novogyne consists of our sales of vivelle  vivelle dot estradot and combipatch to novogyne at a fixed price for resale primarily in the united states as well as the royalties we receive as a result of novogyne s sales of vivelle and vivelle dot 
for additional information on the components of product revenues novogyne as well as our other sources of revenues  see critical accounting policies revenue recognition 

table of contents the decline in revenues from novogyne for as compared to relates to volume declines of product sold to novogyne  which reflect lower prescription trends following the publication of the whi and other ht studies and the impact of inventory reduction initiatives intended to align inventories with post whi demand 
an allowance for returns related to product recalls established in the third and fourth quarters also contributed to the decline 
price was not a factor contributing to this decline 
the increase in revenues from novogyne for as compared to relates to volume increases of product sold to novogyne in the first part of the year  which reflect pre whi prescription trends 
furthermore  vivelle dot estradot canada  which we sell to novogyne  was fully launched in the first quarter of price was not a significant factor contributing to this increase 
product revenues third parties product revenues third parties substantially consists of sales of menorest  estradot and estalis to novartis pharma at a price based on a percentage of the licensee s net selling price subject to certain minima for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  together with royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada 
in  it also included sales of combipatch to aventis at a fixed price 
as discussed above  combipatch was licensed to novogyne in march of revenues from third parties declined million for as compared to  of which million related to volume declines of all products and million related to price declines  primarily of estalis 
novartis pharma has indicated that it has reduced orders for menorest in certain countries in anticipation of planned transitions to estradot 
also contributing to the decline in volume sales of all products are reduced orders as a result of declines in the ht market in europe following the publication of whi and the other ht studies 
revenues from third parties declined million for as compared to  of which  related to volume declines of all products taken in the aggregate  only estradot experienced a volume increase 
the remaining  related to price declines 
the decline in volume sales of estalis relates primarily to several major country launches in  which in the aggregate generated insufficient sales to support re orders at comparable levels in in addition  there were fewer new country launches in the decline in volume sales of combipatch sold to aventis is related to the license of the product to novogyne in march of the increase in sales of estradot relates to the commencement of sales to novartis pharma in the first quarter of license and contract revenues the increase in contract revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to the attainment of certain product development milestones and the completion of certain product development contracts in the increase in license revenues for as compared to is due to the recognition of license revenues in connection with the shire transaction 
beginning in the third quarter of  we ceased amortization of the deferred balance of license revenues received in the shire transaction due to the planned initiation of an additional clinical trial and the significant costs expected to be incurred in seeking methypatch approval 
in the fourth quarter  we began to defer direct expenses incurred in seeking methypatch regulatory approval including the cost of any clinical studies against the deferred revenue balance  which amounted to  for the quarter and year ended december  
table of contents the increase in contract revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to the attainment of certain product development milestones and the completion of certain product development contracts in the increase in license revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to an estradot product approval milestone earned in the first quarter of gross margin gross margin is summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change total product revenues gross profit product revenues less cost of products sold gross margin gross profit as a percentage of product revenues the declines in gross margin in as compared to were primarily due to lower overhead absorption due to lower production volumes  allowances for returns established in related to product recalls  which decreased product revenues without affecting cost of goods sold  and unfavorable product mix as product revenues declined more in the united states where sales have a higher gross margin 
the increase in gross margin in as compared to resulted from a favorable product mix we sold more product in the united states where sales have a higher gross margin and to increases in production volume resulting in more favorable overhead absorption  partially offset by a lower minimum fee payment in operating expenses operating expenses are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change research and development marketing  general and administrative research and development the million decline for as compared to was primarily attributable to million lower expenses for methypatch due to the completion of a phase iii clinical trial in the prior year   lower expenses for our fentanyl transdermal system due to the completion of significant bioequivalence studies in the prior year and  lower fda fees due to the filing of the nda for methypatch in the prior year 

table of contents the  increase for as compared to was primarily attributable to million increases in purchases of materials and other expenses primarily associated with our fentanyl transdermal delivery system and  increased fda fees due to the filing of the nda for methypatch in  partially offset by a million decrease in clinical study expenses for methypatch due to most of the phase iii clinical studies occurring in marketing  general and administrative expenses the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to  in costs associated with product recalls   increase in insurance costs   increase in legal fees  primarily related to the shire transaction   increase in consulting and professional fees  and  increase in accounting and audit fees primarily related to new requirements resulting from sarbanes oxley 
this increase was partially offset by the elimination of million in pre launch marketing expenses for methypatch  which ceased as a result of the shire transaction 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in methypatch pre launch marketing expenses  million compensation costs primarily related to higher bonus payments under our formula incentive plan   increase in insurance expense and  increase in relocation and recruitment expenses 
these expenses were partially offset by  of lower outside consulting services related to the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and  in depreciation and reserves for obsolete production equipment in other income and expenses income taxes our effective tax rate was for and  and for the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the liability is expected to be settled or the asset recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
equity in earnings of novogyne we share in the earnings of novogyne  after satisfaction of an annual preferred return of million to novartis  according to an established formula 
novogyne produced sufficient income in each of  and for us to recognize earnings from novogyne under the formula 
we report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 

table of contents the financial results of novogyne are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change gross revenues sales allowances sales returns allowances sales allowances and returns net revenues cost of sales gross profit gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible asset income from operations interest income net income noven s equity in earnings of novogyne novogyne s gross revenues  which are calculated by adding sales allowances and sales returns allowances to net revenues  is discussed in this section because noven s management believes it is a useful measure to evaluate and compare novogyne s sales period to period in light of the significant historic fluctuations in novogyne s sales allowances and returns 
novogyne net revenues novogyne s gross revenues declined million for as compared to  comprising million related to volume declines  primarily of vivelle and combipatch  partially offset by volume increases in vivelle dot 
the volume declines were partially offset by million related to price increases  primarily for vivelle dot 
the decline in volume sales of vivelle for as compared to is partially attributable to vivelle being in a declining trend due to product maturity 
the lower volume sales of combipatch in were due to the continuing effect of the ht studies described above 
sales allowances consist of chargebacks  medicaid rebates  managed healthcare rebates  cash discounts and other allowances  which tend to fluctuate based on changes in gross revenues 
these sales allowances were  and of gross revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the million decline in sales returns allowances for expiring product for as compared to was primarily attributable to lower unit sales of vivelle  lower returns for the vivelle family  and lower overall trade inventory levels 
these factors caused novogyne to reduce its estimate of future returns and correspondingly reduce its reserve for sales returns allowances by million for the year ended this decline was partially offset by a million increase in allowances for sales returns established in the third and fourth quarters related to product recalls 

table of contents novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to  of which million related to volume increases  primarily of vivelle dot  and million related to price increases for all products 
the increase in volume sales of vivelle dot reflects increased prescription trends prior to whi 
the million increase in sales returns allowances for as compared to was primarily attributable to increased product sales for all products  higher returns for vivelle  and higher overall trade inventory levels 
these factors caused novogyne to increase its estimate of future returns and correspondingly increase its reserve for sales returns allowances for the year ended novogyne gross margin the increase in gross margin for as compared to was primarily due to lower sales allowances and returns  which increased net revenues without affecting cost of goods sold  and lower inventory obsolescence reserves 
the decline in gross margin for as compared to was primarily attributable to higher sales allowances and returns and an increase in inventory obsolescence reserves for novogyne selling  general and administrative novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses declined for as compared to  due to lower advertising and promotion expenses  primarily related to combipatch  and expense reductions associated with the co promotion of novartis famvir product 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in advertising and promotion expenses  million increase of sample expenses and million increase of sales force expenses  primarily due to the launch of combipatch in march and increased focus on our vivelle family of products 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows amounts in thousands cash flows operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of a million license payment upon the closing of the shire transaction in april and million in distributions from novogyne 
the increase was partially offset by changes in working capital due to the timing and amount of product shipments  payment of director s and officer s insurance premiums and payment of income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from an million distribution from novogyne 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from distributions from novogyne totaling million  the receipt of a license fee in the amount of million in connection with the combipatch license transaction and a million milestone payment in connection with the estradot license transaction 
see note  license and contract agreements  in the notes to financial statements for more information 
changes in working capital accounted for most of the remaining change over investing activities net cash used in investing activities in and was primarily attributable to the purchase of fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products and payment of patent development costs 
net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and a million investment in novogyne related to the combipatch acquisition 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by payments made on notes payable 
short term and long term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under development and license agreements and distributions from novogyne 
in april  shire paid us million upon closing of the methypatch transaction 
for the year ended december   substantially all of our income before income taxes was comprised of equity in earnings of novogyne  a non cash item 
our short term liquidity is dependent on sales  royalties and license fees associated with transdermal ht products 
any decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees or any increase in returns of products to novogyne including any such changes resulting from the results of the recent or ongoing ht studies or the pending product label changes  the further decline of the transdermal ht market  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions would have a material adverse effect on our short term liquidity and require us to rely on our existing cash balances or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
although we expect to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
we also expect our funding obligation of an additional methypatch clinical study studies will have a negative impact on our short term liquidity 
we cannot assure that methypatch will be approved by the fda  particularly in light of the not approvable letter we received from the fda in april  or that  even if approved  shire will generate methypatch sales at levels that would trigger our milestone payments  therefore  we cannot assure that we will receive any further payments from shire 
our short term liquidity may also be adversely affected during the period prior to the launch of a new product when we expect to incur new and potentially significant capital expenditures related to the manufacture of the new product as well as the cost for pre launch inventories 

table of contents in the first quarter of  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may acquire up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate price of million 
any repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program could adversely affect our short term liquidity 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that we may license or acquire from others 
we expect that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future development and licensing arrangements  as well as direct sales of our own products 
we expect that our cash requirements will continue to increase  primarily to fund clinical studies for products under development and for plant and equipment to expand production capacity 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
many factors that could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under cautionary factors that may impact future results 
we are unable to predict the effect of the results of the discontinued and ongoing ht studies discussed above on our long term prospects for the ht market or for the market for our transdermal ht products 
accordingly  we are not able to predict the effect that those studies may have on our long term liquidity  results of operations and business prospects 
to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  we will seek alternative sources of financing to fund our operations 
no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet our future cash requirements 
see cautionary factors that may impact future results for a description of certain matters that could affect our short or long term liquidity 
our credit facility for up to a maximum of million expired in april we did not renew this credit facility because we had not used it and had no plans to use it

aggregate contractual obligations the table below lists our significant contractual obligations as of december  all amounts are in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total during the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating leases for machinery  equipment  warehouse and office space

the amounts that may be paid by noven to fund the clinical trials for methypatch are not included in the foregoing table because total costs cannot be determined at this time 
furthermore  the million we may have to pay shire in the case shire would exercise its right to require us to repurchase the product rights of methypatch is also not included

table of contents new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which have one or both of the following characteristics i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and ii the equity investors lack one or more of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies no later than the first reporting period ending after march  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  our investment in novogyne is not considered a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of fin therefore  the consolidation and disclosure rules of fin are not applicable to us and we do not expect any impact on our financial statements from adopting this interpretation 
these conclusions are based on currently available information and require us to assess our investment interest and ownership rights in novogyne 
if our conclusions or our underlying assumptions of factual information concerning our investment in novogyne were to change  novogyne may be considered a vie and our investment in novogyne could become subject to the consolidation and disclosure rules of fin in that case  a determination would have to be made as to the primary beneficiary of novogyne s interest 
the primary beneficiary would then consolidate novogyne 
we believe that even if a determination were made that novogyne was a vie at december   novartis is the primary beneficiary due to its preferred return and equity interest in novogyne and would continue to consolidate novogyne 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities accounted for under statement and is effective for contracts entered into or modified  and for hedges designated  after june  we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  a significant impact on our financial statements from adopting this statement 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after december  we do not anticipate a significant impact on our financial statements from adopting this statement 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the fair value of employee stock options  the determination of the net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset  estimates related to allowance for returns related to product recalls  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows 
table of contents revenue recognition substantially all of our product revenues were for sales to our licensees  novogyne  novartis pharma and its affiliates and aventis pharma ag 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of shipment when both title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer 
certain of our license agreements provide that the ultimate supply price is based on a percentage of the licensee s net selling price 
each of those agreements also establishes a fixed minimum supply price per unit that represents the lowest price we are entitled to receive on sales to the licensee 
we receive the minimum price at the time of shipment with the possibility of an upward adjustment later when the licensee s net selling price is known 
revenues under these agreements are recorded at the minimum price at the time of shipment 
we record any upward adjustments to revenues at the time that the information necessary to make the determination is received from the licensee 
if the upward adjustments are not determinable  we record the adjustments which historically have not been significant on a cash basis 
these amounts are included in product revenues 
royalty revenues consist of royalties payable by novogyne and novartis pharma from sales of vivelle and vivelle dot estradot in the united states and canada 
we accrue royalties from novogyne s and novartis pharma s product sales each quarter based on novogyne s and novartis pharma s net sales for that quarter 
royalties are included in product revenues 
license revenues consist of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements and are not recognized until earned under the terms of the applicable agreements 
in most cases  license revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated product life cycle or the length of relevant patents  whichever is shorter 
estimates of product life cycles are inherently uncertain 
any change to the actual or estimated product life could require us to change the recognition period 
contract revenues consist of contract payments related to research and development projects performed for third parties 
the work performed by us includes feasibility studies to determine if a specific drug is amenable to transdermal drug delivery  the actual formulation of a specific drug into a transdermal drug delivery system  studies to address the ongoing stability of the drug in a transdermal drug delivery system and manufacturing of batches of product that can be used in human clinical trials 
we receive contract payments for the work we perform in the following forms nonrefundable up front payments prior to commencing the work or certain phases of the work  additional payments upon completion of additional phases  and in some cases  success milestone payments based on achievement of specified performance criteria 

table of contents as prescribed by eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenues for those separated units at their fair value  as delivered  based on the proportionate share of the work performed by us as we perform under the contract 
if each deliverable does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the deliverables are combined and the amounts under the contract are allocated to the combined deliverables 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the difference between the amount of the payments received and the amount recognized is recorded as deferred revenues until that amount is earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the analysis prescribed by eitf requires us to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments  including those related to sales price  unit costs  and work performed 
milestone payments are recorded when the specified performance criteria are achieved  as determined by the customer 
each contract may have different payment terms 
therefore  the timing of revenue recognition may vary from contract to contract 
revenues are net of an allowance for returns 
we establish allowances for returns for product that has been recalled or that we believe is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used by us to estimate product recall returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature of the assumptions and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
for example  during novartis initiated recalls of certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot due to production issues 
our revenues for are net of approximately million and million in allowances for returns at noven and novogyne  respectively 
if our estimate concerning the amount of the product returns is incorrect or if novartis should initiate further unexpected recalls  then our results of operations could be materially different 
fair value of stock options we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options as allowed pursuant to sfas  as amended by sfas accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the years ended december   and our accounting for employee stock options complies with accounting practices generally accepted in the united states 
however  from time to time  proposals have been put forth to change the method of accounting for employee stock options that  if adopted  would require us to include the fair value of employee stock options in our compensation expense 
congress  the securities and exchange commission and the accounting profession are reevaluating employee compensation and its accounting  and several new proposals concerning the proper accounting for employee stock options have recently been put forth 
it is not possible to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted  or  if such a policy is adopted  what its requirements may be 
however  it is possible that we may in the future be required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to include the fair value of our employee stock options in our compensation expense 

table of contents had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined on the basis of fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans  consistent with sfas  and as amended by sfas  and our existing valuation method for our employee stock options  the black scholes option pricing model  we estimate that our net income for the years ended december   and would have been reduced by  and  respectively 
however  sfas requires the use of option valuation models that use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  and to date  a uniform standard for calculating the fair value of employee stock options in accordance with sfas has not been adopted 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
in addition  the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for  and may not be representative of the effects for future years because outstanding options vest over a period of several years and additional awards are generally made each year 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon our estimated future income and  accordingly  no valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset was deemed necessary 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
investment in novogyne we entered into a joint venture novogyne with novartis  effective may   to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
we account for our investment in novogyne under the equity method and report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
we defer the recognition of of our profit on products sold to novogyne until the products are sold by novogyne 
as of december   novogyne had a long term intangible asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that novogyne record this asset at cost and that the asset be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
testing for impairment requires novogyne to estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset and compare that amount to the carrying value of the asset 
if this analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the asset 
the determination of fair value of this asset would involve numerous uncertainties because there is no viable actively traded market for the marketing rights of a pharmaceutical product 
as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  if novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the marketing rights  it would utilize a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis values an asset on the basis of the net present value of the cash expected to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments 
for example  estimates need to be made regarding prescription trends  sales price  unit cost and product life cycle among many other factors including the discount rate to be applied to the estimated cash generated by sales of the product 
a material change in any of these assumptions may require novogyne to record an impairment loss  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance were made 
this would reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period and the amount of our investment in novogyne and could  depending on the size of the impairment  result in a loss at both the novogyne and noven level for the period in which the impairment occurred 
neither novogyne nor we are able to predict the effect of the recently discontinued and currently ongoing ht studies  the pending product label changes  or the expected launch of a competitive combination ht patch  on the prospects for the ht market or the market for combipatch 
any adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in combipatch which could require novogyne to record an impairment loss for that asset 

table of contents novogyne records sales net of sales allowances for chargebacks  medicaid rebates  managed healthcare rebates  cash discounts  product returns and other allowances 
the returns portion of the sales allowance related to expiration dating is based in part on novartis returned goods policy 
the methodology used by novogyne to estimate product returns is based on i the historical experience of actual product returns and ii the estimated lag time between when an actual sale takes place in relation to when the products are physically returned by a customer 
the historical actual returns rate is then applied to product sales during the estimated lag period to develop the returns estimate 
however  because novogyne s return history includes periods of higher and lower trade inventory levels and varying levels of demand  in making its final estimations of expected product return  novogyne also considers trends and expectations for future demand and trade inventory levels 
novogyne does not accept returns due to short dating until the product has less than a certain amount of shelf life remaining 
also  novogyne does not accept returns due to expiration later than a certain period after the product has expired 
these policies cause a significant lag time between when a product is sold and the latest date on which a return could occur 
novogyne believes this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate returns exposure and incorporates the key factors that contribute to returns 
in addition  novogyne establishes sales returns allowances for product that has been recalled or that they believe is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used to estimate product returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

table of contents outlook a summary of our initial financial guidance is provided below 
this financial guidance assumes that there are no acquisitions  unusual transactions  changes in accounting  or material changes in the demand for our ht products or in our business relationships collaborations 
we cannot assure that we will achieve results consistent with this guidance  and refer you to the risks  uncertainties and cautionary factors discussed below and under the caption cautionary factors that may impact future results in item of this form k that could impact our ability to achieve such results 
financial guidance for full year  we currently expect net revenues to approximate results  research and development spending in to increase compared to  and fully diluted earnings per share to be in the to range 
novogyne s net revenues and net income are expected to approximate results 
operating results are expected to fluctuate by quarter in part due to the timing of orders placed by trade customers 
novogyne s first quarter contribution to noven s profit is expected to be lower than in subsequent quarters due to satisfaction of a million preferred distribution to novartis under the joint venture agreements 
in addition  noven expects that novogyne s first quarter sales may be lower than sales in the fourth quarter due to the timing of orders placed by trade customers 
endo on february   we licensed our developmental generic fentanyl patch to endo 
our fentanyl patch is intended to be the generic equivalent of johnson johnson s duragesic fentanyl transdermal system  which had branded us sales of over billion in we received an million up front payment from endo on signing 
upon endo s first commercial sale of the fentanyl patch  we are entitled to receive an additional payment ranging from million to million  depending on the timing of launch and the number of generic fentanyl competitors in the market 
we will manufacture and supply the product at our cost and will share in endo s profit from product sales 
based on the current patent and exclusivity status of duragesic  we believe that the earliest our generic fentanyl patch could be launched is january  assuming fda approval is received by that time  but we cannot assure that we will receive fda approval by that time or at all 
noven and endo may elect to manufacture launch supplies prior to receipt of tentative fda approval 
if launch supplies are manufactured and approval is not ultimately received or is delayed  the agreement provides that noven and endo will share the cost of manufacturing product that cannot be sold by endo in accordance with an agreed upon formula  but we would be unable to offset all of our up front production costs with sales of the product 
if the product has not been approved or we have not supplied endo s launch requirements by may  endo may have the right to terminate the license  depending on the number of generic competitors in the market 

table of contents in addition to the fentanyl license  we have established a collaboration with endo to seek to identify and develop new transdermal therapies 
of the million up front payment  million will be allocated to fund feasibility studies that we expect to undertake to seek to determine whether certain compounds identified by the parties can be delivered using our transdermal technology 
endo is expected to fund and manage clinical development of those compounds proceeding into clinical trials 
the million received by noven at signing is expected to be recognized as revenues over a period of years 
p g pharmaceuticals in april  we established a collaboration with p gp for the development of new prescription patches 
the products under development explore follow on product opportunities for intrinsa  p gp s in licensed investigational transdermal testosterone patch designed to help restore desire in menopausal women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder 
p gp has initiated studies of the first product in humans 
potential development milestones totaling million remain to be received under the p gp collaboration  a portion of which is expected to be received in the remainder of shire in april  we received a not approvable letter from the fda relating to our methypatch new drug application 
during  noven and shire expect to undertake additional methypatch clinical studies 
noven has committed to fund the additional studies 
our direct costs incurred in pursuit of approval are expected to be deferred against a portion of the million deferred revenue previously received from shire  and therefore such expenses are not expected to impact our research and development expenses in in light of the not approvable letter  it is possible that development will not be completed and or that methypatch will not be approved or launched  and that we may not receive additional milestone payments or manufacturing revenues from shire 
cautionary factors that may impact future results except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our and our strategic partners respective plans  objectives  expectations  estimates  strategies  product approvals and development plans  and anticipated financial results 
these statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  could  should  seeks  will  would and similar words 
these statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future events but are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting our operations  results of operations  markets  products  prices and prospects  and other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report and the other documents filed by us with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these factors may cause our results to differ materially from the statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us 
the following is a summary of some of the risk factors  which are not listed in order of priority  that could adversely affect our results 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operation 
we do not undertake to update any of these forward looking statements or to announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements except as required by law 

table of contents the market for ht products  including our line of transdermal ht products  has been negatively affected by studies indicating adverse health risks associated with ht products 
additional ht studies may cause the market for ht products to further decline 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our line of ht transdermal products 
the market for ht products has been negatively affected by the whi study and other studies that have found that the overall health risks from the use of certain oral ht products exceed the benefits from the use of those products among healthy postmenopausal women 
for example  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states declined by from the second quarter of the quarter immediately preceding the whi study to the fourth quarter of other studies evaluating ht are currently underway or in the planning stages 
the market for ht products  including ours  both in the united states and abroad  could be further adversely impacted if these studies are halted or otherwise find unacceptable risks from ht use 
currently  our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects are almost entirely dependent on sales  license royalties and fees associated with transdermal ht products 
accordingly  any further adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  license or acquire new products and to bring these new products to market on a timely basis 
our failure to do so could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our long term strategy is dependent upon the successful development of new products  such as methypatch and our transdermal fentanyl system for chronic pain  and their successful commercialization 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify commercially promising products or technologies 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities may be considerable 
no assurance can be given that we will have the financial resources necessary to complete products under development  that those projects to which we dedicate resources will be successfully completed  that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such product  or that any approved product can be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  either by us or by a licensing partner 
a project can fail or be delayed at any stage of development  even if each prior stage was completed successfully  which could jeopardize our ability to recover our investment in the product 
some of our development projects will not be completed successfully or on schedule 
many of the factors which may cause a product in development to fail or be delayed  such as difficulty in enrolling patients in clinical trials  the failure of clinical trials  lack of sufficient supplies or raw materials  inability to apply the subject product or technology on a commercial scale on an economical basis and changes in regulations  are beyond our control 

table of contents from time to time we may need to acquire licenses to patents and other intellectual property of third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
the failure to obtain such a license could negatively affect our ability to develop  manufacture and commercialize certain products 
in some cases  we have begun and  in the future  may begin development of a product that we do not intend to independently develop through clinical trials and market  with the expectation that a licensee will be identified to assist in development and or marketing 
there can be no assurance that we will attract a business partner for any particular product or will be able to negotiate an agreement on commercially reasonable terms 
if an agreement is not reached  our initial development investment in any such product may not be recovered 
we depend on partners to obtain regulatory approval for  and to market and sell  certain of our products 
our marketing partners sell products that compete with our products 
we depend upon collaborative agreements with other pharmaceutical companies to obtain regulatory approval for and to market and sell certain of our products 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for the distribution of novogyne s products  including vivelle  and for selling novogyne s products to its trade customers 
for methypatch  we have granted the exclusive marketing rights to shire and we are working jointly with shire to obtain fda approval of methypatch 
for our transdermal fentanyl patch  we have granted the exclusive marketing rights to endo 
failure of novartis and our other marketing partners to market our products successfully would cause the quantity of products purchased from us and the amount of fees and royalties ultimately paid to us to be reduced and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our partners may have different and  sometimes  competing priorities 
some of our partners  including novartis and shire  market and sell products competitive with ours 
the marketing organizations of our partners may be unsuccessful  or those partners may assign a lower level of priority to the marketing of our products 
if one or more partners fails to pursue the marketing of our products as planned  or if marketing of any of those products is otherwise delayed  our business  financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected 
absent these marketing partners  we do not presently have a significant direct marketing channel to health care providers for our drug delivery technologies 
we do not control novogyne and we may face additional risks because novartis  our joint venture partner  has significantly greater resources than we do 
our equity in earnings of novogyne contributed substantially all of our income before income taxes in  and novogyne s results will likely continue to be material to us in the future 
because  among other things  we are vastly different in size from novartis  and because novartis and its affiliates sell competing products outside of novogyne  our interests may not always be aligned 
this may result in potential conflicts between novartis and us on matters relating to novogyne which we may not be able to resolve on favorable terms or at all 
novartis has the right to dissolve novogyne under certain circumstances 
novogyne s management committee is comprised of a majority of representatives from novartis 
while certain significant corporate actions require the supermajority vote of the committee members  we do not control novogyne 
in addition  the joint venture operating agreement has a buy sell provision that either noven or novartis may trigger by notifying the other party of the price at which the triggering party would be willing to acquire of the joint venture 
upon receipt of this notice  the non triggering party has the option to either purchase the triggering party s interest in novogyne or to sell its own interest in novogyne to the triggering party at the price established by the triggering party 
if noven is the purchaser  then noven must pay an additional amount equal to the net present value of novartis preferred profit return 
this amount is calculated by applying a specified discount rate and a period of years to novartis million annual preferred return 
novartis is a larger company with greater financial resources  and therefore may be in a better position to be the purchaser if the provision is triggered 
if the provision is triggered and novartis is the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in a manner that would result in sufficient earnings to offset the loss of earnings from novogyne 
if the provision is triggered and we are the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would not be adversely affected by the changes in capital and or debt structure that likely would be required to finance the purchase transaction 

table of contents we depend on novartis to perform financial  accounting  inventory  sales deductions and other functions for novogyne 
under the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing novogyne with certain financial  accounting  legal and regulatory services  including monitoring inventory levels 
in late  inventory levels at novogyne exceeded then current and expected demand  which negatively affected our sales and results of operations in the first half of as novogyne curtailed product shipments to its trade customers  and we deferred product shipments to novogyne 
novartis is also responsible for estimating and recording sales allowances for novogyne including reserves and allowances related to product returns 
as a consequence  we may have limited ability to accurately forecast the amount of such sales allowances in any period 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would  consequently also reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
failure by novartis to perform its obligations under the joint venture could negatively affect the financial position and results of operations of novogyne and us 
we may be unable to obtain marketing approval for our new products  including methypatch and our fentanyl patch 
we are not able to market our products including generic drug products in the united states or in another jurisdiction without first obtaining marketing approval from the fda or an equivalent foreign agency 
in april  we received a not approvable letter from the fda relating to our methypatch nda 
a not approvable letter is issued if the fda does not consider the application approvable because one or more deficiencies in the application preclude the fda from approving it 
the letter cited clinical and other issues as the basis for non approval 
in october  we submitted with shire a jointly prepared study protocol for an additional clinical study for methypatch to the fda for review and comment 
in november  the fda responded to our draft protocol and reported that the proposed study design did not address the clinical risk benefit issues raised in the april not approvable letter 
in its november response  the fda provided specific recommendations regarding the proposed study design 
noven and shire are working together to review and respond to the fda s comments with respect to the study design 
we believe this study is necessary to amend the nda and that other studies may also be required or advisable 
under our november agreement with shire  if we agree with shire on a study design  shire will manage the new clinical study and we will fund it 
under our agreement with shire  we are responsible for providing the clinical supplies for the study and we may also incur certain additional expenses in pursuit of regulatory approval 
at the conclusion of the trial  if shire determines that submission of the study results to the fda would not result in a commercially viable product  shire will have the right to terminate the original transaction agreement 
if shire exercises its termination right under these circumstances  however  shire will forfeit its right to require us to repurchase the product rights  and the product rights will revert to us without payment to shire 
we can not assure that any revised study design will be acceptable to the fda  or even if acceptable  will produce study results that will result in a commercially viable product 

table of contents in addition to methypatch  we are currently seeking regulatory approval for our fentanyl transdermal system for chronic pain and our partners are currently seeking regulatory approval for other products  including a next generation transdermal combination estrogen progestin patch 
we can not assure that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approval for these products or any other products we may seek to commercialize or that any such approval will be free from unduly burdensome conditions or limitations 
in light of the whi and other ht studies  it is possible that healthcare regulators could delay the approval of ht products or require that any new ht products be subject to more extensive or more rigorous study and testing prior to being approved  or could receive approval subject to more extensive conditions or limitations 
our approved products may not achieve the expected level of market acceptance 
even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our new products  the success of our products will depend on their market acceptance 
substantially all of our revenues are generated through sales of transdermal delivery systems  which generally are more expensive than oral formations 
our products are marketed primarily to physicians  some of whom are reluctant to prescribe a transdermal delivery system when an alternative delivery system is available 
we and our licensees must demonstrate to prescribing physicians the benefits of transdermal delivery  especially with respect to products such as methypatch for which there is presently no transdermal system on the market 
the commercial success of our products is also based in part on patient preference  and difficulties in obtaining patient acceptance of our transdermal delivery systems may similarly impact our ability to market our products 
even if we obtain fda approval for methypatch  the market for this product may be negatively affected by the ongoing public debate in the united states regarding the appropriateness of using methylphenidate and other medications to treat children with adhd 
we expect that this debate will continue for the foreseeable future 
the outcome of this debate is uncertain  and we cannot predict what impact  if any  the increased public attention will have on the market for products indicated for adhd or on methypatch 
because at least part of the stigma results from the fact that most of the current products are schedule ii controlled substances  the non stimulant product sold by eli lilly may benefit from this controversy at the expense of the methylphenidate and amphetamine based products on the market 
see business competition 

table of contents failure to comply with our supply agreements or otherwise adequately supply our products to our licensees could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our supply agreements with our licensees impose strict obligations on us with respect to the manufacture and supply of our products 
we devote significant time  effort and expense complying with these requirements 
failure to comply with the terms of these supply agreements may result in our being unable to supply product to our licensees  resulting in lost revenues by us and potential responsibility for damages and losses suffered by our licensees 
our supply agreement for vivelle and vivelle dot has expired 
since the expiration of the vivelle supply agreement  the parties have continued to operate in accordance with the supply agreement s commercial terms 
we cannot assure that we will enter into a new supply agreement on satisfactory terms or at all 
it is not clear that the non commercial terms of the supply agreement would be enforceable with respect to post expiration events or occurrences 
due to our dependence on novogyne  we may be unable to negotiate favorable business terms with them or resolve any dispute that we may be involved in with them in a favorable manner 
failure to extend the supply agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
designation of a new supplier and approval of a new supply agreement would require the affirmative vote of four of the five members of novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  both novartis and noven must agree on novogyne s supplier 
methypatch and our fentanyl transdermal system are new products that we have never manufactured on a commercial scale 
the terms of the shire transaction will permit shire to qualify a second manufacturing source and purchase a portion of its methypatch requirements from the second source 
endo will have the same right under certain circumstances for our fentanyl patch 
failure to meet either party s requirements would affect our revenues and could affect the success of our new product launches and may result in shire or endo relying more heavily on second sources  reducing the manufacturing revenues that we would otherwise realize 
it may also jeopardize our ability to obtain milestone payments under the shire and endo transactions 
in addition  the active ingredients in methypatch and our fentanyl patch are more expensive than the active ingredients in our ht patch products 
if we experience manufacturing difficulties such as quality problems  yield deficiencies or similar issues  our overall manufacturing costs may be higher than anticipated 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with fda regulations and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries with respect to the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting  product promotion  product pricing and discounting  drug sample accountability  drug product stability  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practices  and product changes or modifications 
our facilities handle controlled substances  resulting in additional extensive regulatory requirements and oversight 
we devote significant time  effort and expense addressing the extensive government regulations applicable to our business 
even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority  product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product 
failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in fines  warning letters  unanticipated compliance expenditures  interruptions or suspension of production and resulting loss of sales  product seizures or recalls  injunctions prohibiting further sales  withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications  and criminal prosecution 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing regulatory services 
while we believe that novartis provides these services adequately  there can be no assurance that a violation of any of these regulations will not have an adverse effect on us 

table of contents new labeling requirements may negatively affect sales of our ht products 
in january  the fda announced that marketers of ht products  including novogyne  are required to modify their ht product labels to include additional safety information and warnings 
among other things  the labels must indicate that ht should be used for short term therapy only and that  in the absence of clinical studies demonstrating that ht products other than the oral product studied in the whi study are safe  physicians should assume that all ht products carry the same risks 
we expect further revisions to ht product labels may be required by the fda to include information from the women s health initiative memory study  which reported an increased risk of dementia from use by women and older of an oral combination estrogen with progestin product 
we rely on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and compounds used in our products 
certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products  including essential polymer adhesives  are available from limited sources  and  in some cases  a single source 
in addition  regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for transdermal products 
our nda for methypatch  for example  includes only one supplier of the active pharmaceutical compound 
this same supplier is also the only source of the active pharmaceutical compound for which we have sought approval under the anda for our transdermal fentanyl system 
any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could be accompanied by production or other delays  and  in the case of products for which only one raw material supplier exists  could result in a material loss of sales 
in the case of controlled substances  the dea sets quotas for controlled substances  including methylphenidate  fentanyl and amphetamine  and we must receive authorization from the dea to handle these substances 
we cannot assure that we will be granted sufficient dea quota to meet production requirements for controlled substances 
without adequate approved supplies of raw materials or packaging supplies  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted until another supplier is identified  our products approved and trading terms with it negotiated 
we may not be able to identify an alternative supplier and any supplier that we do identify may not be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms with an alternative supplier 
any disruptions in our manufacturing operations from the loss of an approved supplier may cause us to incur increased costs and lose revenues and may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
some raw materials used in our products are supplied by companies that restrict certain medical uses of their products 
while our use is presently acceptable  there can be no assurance that such companies will not expand their restrictions to include our applications 
our business also faces the risk that third party suppliers may supply us with raw materials that do not meet required specifications  which  if undetected by us  could cause our products to test out of specification and require us to recall the affected product 

table of contents we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before  or more successfully  than we do 
we face competition from a number of companies in the development of transdermal drug delivery products  and competition is expected to intensify as more companies enter the field 
some of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have greater resources than we do  as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
as a result  they may succeed before us in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approvals for products 
our products compete with other transdermal products as well as alternative dosage forms of the same or comparable chemical entities  as well as non drug therapies 
for example  we expect increased competition in the estrogen market as a result of the launch of a vaginal estrogen delivery system  the launch of a combination estrogen progestin patch and the expected launches of estrogen cream and gel products  each of which is a new dosage form in this category  as well as the expected launch of an ultra low dose estrogen patch 
the adhd market is very competitive and our receipt of the sales based milestones under the shire agreement depends on the methypatch sales levels achieved by shire which already markets non methylphenidate adhd products 
other competitors marketing or developing adhd products include johnson johnson  novartis  glaxo smithkline  bristol myers squibb  abbott laboratories  celltech plc  cephalon  inc and eli lilly 
johnson johnson markets concerta  the market leading methylphenidate product  and novartis and eli lilly company lilly market competitive adhd products 
strattera  a non stimulant  non controlled substance therapy launched by lilly in  has gained significant market share in a short period of time 
there is at least one clinical study underway comparing the efficacy of strattera to a long acting methylphenidate product 
if strattera or other therapies in development by other companies become recognized as therapeutically superior to stimulants  or are preferred by physicians  parents and or patients  the market for methypatch would be adversely affected 
these competitive products  especially those already marketed by shire and those not designated as controlled substances  may negatively impact shire s ability to gain market share for methypatch and therefore may decrease the likelihood that we will receive the sales based milestone payments 
subject to fda approval  we expect our fentanyl transdermal system will compete against other generic equivalents of johnson johnson s duragesic patch 
in the market for generic equivalents  the first products to be approved and available for sale typically are able to achieve and maintain significant market share 
as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit for a generic product is typically tied to the number of competitors in the market and the timing of that product s fda approval and launch in relation to competing approvals and launches 
in addition to other generic manufacturers  we expect to face competition from johnson johnson  the manufacturer of duragesic  who may seek to compete in this market by collaborating with other generic pharmaceutical companies or by marketing their own generic equivalent of duragesic 
johnson johnson s patent and pediatric exclusivity for duragesic expire in january  which is the earliest possible date that we could launch our fentanyl transdermal system  but we cannot assure that we will obtain fda approval or launch a product in that time frame or at all 
mylan laboratories has received final approval from the fda for its generic fentanyl transdermal system and has announced its intention to launch this product in july we believe that other generic manufactures have submitted or will submit andas for fentanyl transdermal systems 
to seek to be prepared for a timely launch  we expect to manufacture launch supplies prior to receipt of tentative fda approval 
if launch supplies are manufactured and approval is not ultimately received or is sufficiently delayed such that these supplies are not saleable  the license agreement provides that we will share the cost of manufacturing these supplies with endo in accordance with a formula  but we would be unable to offset all of our up front production costs with sales of the product 
we expect that these costs could be significant 
we cannot assure that our products will compete successfully against competitive products or that developments by others will not render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors or their own internally developed technologies 

table of contents competitors may use legal  regulatory and legislative strategies to prevent or delay our launch of generic products such as our developmental transdermal fentanyl system 
the hatch waxman act provides for a period of days of generic marketing exclusivity for each anda applicant that is first to file an anda containing a certification of invalidity  non infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to a reference drug product  commonly referred to as a paragraph iv certification 
during this exclusivity period  the fda cannot grant final approval to any other generic equivalent 
if an anda containing a paragraph iv certification is successful  it generally results in higher market share  net revenues and gross margin for that applicant 
even if we obtain fda approval for generic drug products  we may lose significant advantages to a competitor who was first to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification 
competitors may also pursue legislative and other regulatory strategies to prevent or delay our launch of a generic product such as our developmental transdermal fentanyl system 
these strategies include  but are not limited to seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire  filing a citizen petition with the fda  pursuing state legislative efforts to limit the substitution of generic versions of brand pharmaceuticals  filing patent infringement lawsuits that automatically delay fda approval of many generic products  introducing a second generation product prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the first generation product which may reduce demand for a generic first generation product  and obtaining market exclusivity extensions by conducting pediatric trials of brand drugs 
the european market may be limited due to pricing pressures and other matters 
pharmaceutical prices  including prices for our products  in europe and certain other countries are significantly lower than in the united states 
because our agreements with novartis pharma provide for us to receive a percentage of novartis pharma s net selling price subject to a minimum price  our gross margins are generally much lower for product sold to novartis pharma for resale outside of the united states than for product sold to novogyne for sale in the united states 
in addition  the lower prices restrict novartis pharma s gross margin realized from selling our products 
because our products compete for sales and marketing resources with other novartis pharma products  including competitive ht products  there can be no assurance that the relatively low gross margins generated from selling our products will not cause novartis pharma to focus its resources on other products or even not launch our products in certain countries 
novartis pharma has informed us that pricing  government reimbursement and labeling issues are adversely impacting its launch plans for estradot in many countries  including the united kingdom  france  spain and italy 
novartis pharma is seeking a marketing partner to launch estradot in the united kingdom and france  but to date has been unsuccessful 
the profitability of sales in europe may also be negatively affected by parallel trade practices in the european union whereby a licensed importer may take advantage of price disparity between markets by purchasing our products in a market with a relatively lower price and then importing them into a country with relatively higher price 
in addition  novartis pharma has determined that  in light of marketing changes since publication of the ht studies  a dosage strength of estalis lower than the second dosage strength is necessary for the product to obtain market acceptance in europe 

table of contents our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations  and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 
we expect that revenues from product sales to our licensees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon various factors not in our control  including the marketing efforts of each licensee  the inventory requirements of each licensee  the impact of competitive products  the timing and scope of estalis and estradot launches and commercialization efforts by novartis pharma  combipatch prescription trends in the united states  the impact of the ht studies on prescriptions for our hormone replacement products  the product pricing of each licensee  the timing of certain royalty reconciliations and payments under our license agreements  the timing of fda approval of methypatch or our fentanyl patch  if any  and any subsequent product launch of these products  and the success of shire s and endo s commercialization efforts 
our earnings may fluctuate because of  among other things  fluctuations in research and development spending resulting from the timing of clinical trials involving products in development 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if novogyne or we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require noven and novogyne to test the recoverability of their respective long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
novogyne recorded the acquisition of combipatch marketing rights at cost and tests this asset for impairment on a periodic basis 
any further adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in its combipatch marketing rights  which could require novogyne to revalue that asset 
impairment of that asset would adversely affect novogyne s  and consequently our  operating results 
we cannot be certain of the protection or confidentiality of our patents and proprietary rights 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain or license patents for our products  processes and technologies 
if we do not do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues from those innovations 
there is no assurance that we will be issued patents for any of our patent applications  that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products  or that we will be able to enforce successfully our patent rights 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products  or challenging  invalidating or avoiding our patent applications or any existing or future patents that we receive or license 
many of our patents are formulation patents and would not preclude others from developing and marketing products that deliver drugs transdermally through non infringing formulations 
furthermore  there is no assurance that any of our future processes or products will be patentable  that any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions or that our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation 
we use confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation  but there can be no assurance that these parties will not breach their agreements with us 
we also cannot be certain that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or that our competitors will not independently develop our trade secrets and proprietary technology 

table of contents third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights  forcing us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
any unfavorable outcome could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our success will also depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and there can be no assurance that our products and processes will not infringe upon the patents of others 
third parties may also institute patent litigation against us for competitive reasons unrelated to any infringement by us 
if a third party asserts a claim of infringement  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those third party patents in court 
if we cannot obtain the required licenses  or are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by the patents of others 
there can be no assurance that we have identified  or that in the future we will be able to identify  all us and foreign patents that may pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
we may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for our products by governmental authorities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
our ability and our marketing partners ability to commercialize our products  including methypatch  is dependent in part on obtaining reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states and the prominence of health maintenance organizations hmos and similar entities could significantly influence the purchase of our products  resulting in lower prices and lower demand 
this is particularly true in a market that includes generic alternatives  such as the adhd market 
there can be no assurance that shire will obtain acceptable reimbursement status for methypatch 
additionally  if strattera  a non stimulant adhd treatment  becomes recognized as therapeutically superior to stimulant based treatments such as methypatch  the reimbursement status of methypatch may be adversely affected 
there can also be no assurance that managed care agreement established by novartis will not adversely affect novogyne s financial results 
in europe  novartis pharma has informed us that estradot has been launched in spain without government reimbursement and that reimbursement and pricing issues are adversely affecting its launch plans in several european markets 
health care reform or other changes in government regulation could harm our business 
the federal and state governments in the united states  as well as many foreign governments  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform 
in the united states  these proposals include government programs involving prescription drug reimbursement benefits for seniors 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth from country to country and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical industry or on our business  financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we may be exposed to product liability claims 
like all pharmaceutical companies  the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
the publication of the ht study data described above may increase the likelihood of product liability claims against us 
we are aware that claims have been brought against wyeth pharmaceuticals with respect to their oral ht product that was the particular subject of the ht study 
if any such claims against us are successful  we may be required to make significant compensation payments and suffer the associated adverse publicity 
we maintain product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
the trend in the pharmaceutical insurance market is toward narrower coverage and higher premiums  with certain pharmaceutical compounds specifically excluded from coverage 
if a claim is not covered or if our coverage is insufficient  we may incur significant liability payments that would negatively affect our business  financial position or results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured at one location 
an interruption of production at this facility could negatively affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured at a single facility in miami  florida 
an interruption of manufacturing resulting from regulatory issues  technical problems  casualty loss including hurricane or other factors could result in our inability to meet production requirements  which may cause us to lose revenues and which could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
without our existing production facility  we would have no other means of manufacturing our products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues and profits resulting from casualty losses  this insurance does not cover all possible situations and there can be no assurance that any event of casualty to our facility would be covered by such insurance 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing partners and customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate and rising insurance premiums could negatively affect our profitability 
we rely on insurance to protect us from many business risks  including product liability  business interruption  property and casualty loss  employment practices liability and directors and officers liability 
an increase in the number of securities class action suits  an increase in damages and or settlements paid in connection with certain of these class actions  an increase in the number of product liability claims and the resulting damages and settlements  including those resulting from the ht studies discussed above  and other factors we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  could result in difficulty in obtaining adequate coverage at historical rates 
the recent corporate and accounting scandals involving large public companies have also served to increase the cost of insurance to all businesses 
in most cases  as is the trend in the pharmaceutical industry  as insurance policies expire  we may be required to procure policies with narrower coverage  more exclusions and higher premiums 
in some cases  coverage may not be available at any price 
there can be no assurance that the insurance that we maintain and intend to maintain will be adequate  or that the cost of insurance and limitations in coverage will not adversely affect our business  financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we enter into agreements that include provisions that require us to indemnify the other party 
our financial position and results of operations could be harmed if we are required to perform under these indemnification provisions 
in the normal course of business  we enter into license  supply  employment and other agreements that include indemnification provisions 
while insurance coverage may mitigate some of our obligations under these indemnification provisions  our business  financial position and results of operations could be harmed if we are required to perform under these indemnification provisions and there is no or insufficient insurance coverage 
our success depends on attracting and retaining our key employees 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced personnel 
we face significant competition in recruiting competent personnel 
in the past  our location in an area with relatively few pharmaceutical companies has made recruitment more difficult  as many candidates prefer to work in places with a broad pharmaceutical industry presence 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional  competent employees  could adversely affect our business  financial position or results of operations 
our stockholders rights plan  our charter documents  delaware law and our joint venture with novartis may have an anti takeover effect 
our stockholders rights plan  our corporate charter documents  delaware law and our joint venture operating agreement with novartis each include provisions that may discourage or prevent parties from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of prevailing market prices in an acquisition of noven 
we have a stockholders rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which is intended to cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors has not approved 
the existence of the stockholders rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our common stock without the consent of our board of directors 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders  call special meetings or nominate candidates to serve on our board of directors 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 

table of contents in addition  the operating agreement for our joint venture with novartis has a buy sell provision that either party may trigger by notifying the other party of the price at which the triggering party would be willing to acquire the joint venture 
in response to this notice  the non triggering party has the option to either purchase the triggering party s interest in novogyne or to sell its own interest in novogyne to the triggering party at the price established by the triggering party 
in addition  if novartis is the seller  then novartis is entitled to an additional amount equal to the net present value of novartis preferred profit return 
this amount is calculated by applying a specified discount rate and a period of years to novartis million annual preferred return 
as a result of the buy sell provision  any potential acquirer of noven faces the possibility that novartis could trigger this provision at any time and thereby require the acquirer to either purchase for cash novartis interest in novogyne or to sell its interest in novogyne to novartis 
the existence of the buy sell provision and the uncertainty it may create could discourage an acquisition of noven by a third party  which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock 
the market price for our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
from january  to march   our common stock traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
any number of factors  including some over which we have no control and some unrelated to our business or financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new commercial products  changes in governmental regulation  receipt by us or one of our competitors of regulatory approvals or adverse regulatory determinations  developments relating to our patents or proprietary rights of one of our competitors  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results or risks for products that we or one of our competitors market or has under development  and period to period changes in financial results and the economy generally 
we  like any other company with a volatile stock price  may be subject to further securities litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results
