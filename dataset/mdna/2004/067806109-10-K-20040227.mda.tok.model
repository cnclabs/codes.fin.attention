item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview highlights in  barnes group the company achieved record sales of million and growth in net income  to million 
an important part of this financial success came from the february acquisition of kar  a leading provider of mro supplies in the us and canada 
to help fund the kar acquisition and strengthen the balance sheet  the company accessed the public capital markets for the first time in several decades  raising million through an equity offering 
the equity offering also greatly improved the trading liquidity of barnes group stock  enhancing its appeal to investors 
the company has invested approximately million in two revenue sharing programs rsps with a major aerospace company  securing long term relationships for aftermarket production of parts with attractive financial returns 
this represented a new strategic direction for the way the company approaches its aerospace customer relationships  which management will continue to develop going forward 
management objectives management has embraced a corporate culture within barnes group that has as its common goals the generation of sustainable  profitable growth and building lasting value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for generating growth include organic growth from new products and services  markets and customers  and growth from strategic acquisitions  of which eight have been completed since our business barnes group consists of three operating groups barnes distribution  an international distributor of industrial mrop supplies  associated spring  one of the world s largest manufacturers of precision mechanical and nitrogen gas springs  and a global supplier of retaining rings and plastic injection molded components  and barnes aerospace  a manufacturer and repairer of highly engineered assemblies and products for aircraft engines  airframes  and land based industrial gas turbines 
in each of these businesses  barnes group is among the leaders in the market niches it serves  and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures 
key performance indicators management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses and certain components of other income and other expenses  as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
management also uses an internal measurement tool called ppat  or performance profit after tax 
ppat is an economic value added eva like metric that calculates operating profit after tax  less a charge for the capital employed by the business 
management utilizes ppat in economic decision making  such as capital expenditures  investments in growth initiatives  customer pricing decisions  and evaluation of acquisitions 
the goal of utilizing ppat is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation 
in addition to ppat  which is a measurement tool common among each of the operating groups  each business has its own key performance indicators kpis  a number of which are focused on customer satisfaction 
in barnes distribution  kpis include daily sales average  or dsa  average order size  fill rate  which is the percentage of order lines filled on the first pass from the distribution center assigned to that customer  and order turnaround  which tracks the time between order receipt and shipment to the customer 
at associated spring  kpis include sales and orders per day  which together provide visibility on sales in the next days 
management tracks inventory turns and sales per employee to gauge efficiency  and measures on time delivery and the number of defective parts per million as means of evaluating customer service levels 
at barnes aerospace  important kpis are customer orders and backlog  which are utilized to forecast how sales will develop over the next months 
in the oem operations  management closely tracks quality measurements  on time delivery to its customers and in the overhaul and repair operations  management measures turnaround time of overhauled or repaired parts returned to the customers 
key industry data in each business  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at barnes distribution  this data includes the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in our operations in canada  france and the uk and also utilizes the business conditions report of the precision metalforming association  which correlates well with demand for barnes distribution s raymond products 
for associated spring  key data include the production of light vehicles  both in the us and globally  new vehicle platform  engine and transmission programs  durable goods orders  handset purchases for cell phones  and capital investments in the telecommunications and electronics industries 
at barnes aerospace  for its oem operations  management regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers  as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft 
in the overhaul and repair operations  management monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet  the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service  and aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines 
management also monitors annual appropriations for the us military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance 
acquisitions acquisitions have been a key growth driver for the company in each of its three business segments 
the company acquired a number of businesses during the past three years  the most recent of which is kar  described more fully below 
the company continues to look for acquisitions that will broaden product line offerings and expand geographic reach  and acquisitions that provide synergistic opportunities 
in february  the company acquired kar  which is a leading full service distributor of mro supplies to industrial  construction  transportation and other markets 
the consideration for the acquisition was million 
this acquisition expands both the geographic scope and product line reach of the barnes distribution segment 
kar has a diversified customer base that operates in all states of the us  puerto rico  and canada  further enhancing barnes distribution s leadership position within the mrop market and international presence 
in connection with the acquisition  management has approved and committed to certain activities aimed at achieving a number of post acquisition cost savings and other synergies through headquarters and infrastructure consolidation 
this plan includes combining the headquarters functions and consolidating warehousing and distribution networks 
as a result  in the company recorded total costs of million related primarily to lease consolidation costs  facility closure costs  reductions in personnel and other costs 
of this amount  million associated with the acquired business is reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to net assets acquired 
the remaining costs of million are reflected as expenses during management anticipates additional costs of approximately million to be incurred and reported as expense in these expenses include outside services  temporary labor and overtime related to the reconfiguration of distribution centers and inventory moves 
in  the company completed two acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in february  the company acquired substantially all of the manufacturing assets of seeger orbis gmbh co 
ohg of germany seeger orbis from transtechnology corporation 
seeger orbis is a leading manufacturer of retaining rings used in a number of transportation and industrial applications 
the seeger orbis acquisition expanded associated spring s product line and geographic reach  particularly into the automotive and industrial manufacturing markets of western europe 
in april  the company acquired spectrum plastics molding resources  inc of ansonia  connecticut spectrum 
spectrum is a manufacturer of plastic injection molded components and assemblies that are used primarily in the telecommunications  electronics  medical and consumer goods industries 
spectrum  which is included in the associated spring segment  provides associated spring with the capability of providing more complete product solutions with discrete or continuous metal in plastic and plastic on metal injection molded components 
for a more detailed description of acquisitions made over the past three years  refer to notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
results of operations sales in millions change change barnes distribution associated spring barnes aerospace intersegment sales total barnes group reported record net sales of million in  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million 
the sales increase reflected the company s recent acquisitions  which contributed million to barnes distribution s sales and million to associated spring s sales  plus approximately million of positive impact on sales from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  primarily in europe and canada 
the incremental acquisition sales include million of sales attributable to a strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar resulting in a total foreign currency translation impact of million 
also contributing to the sales increase was continued growth of associated spring s nitrogen gas business 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in associated spring s north american and asian sales and a decline in sales at barnes aerospace  which coincided with the continuing decline in the commercial aerospace markets 
from a geographic perspective  the company s international sales increased year over year and domestic sales increased 
excluding the positive impact on sales of foreign currency translation  the company s international sales increased in over in  barnes group s net sales were up million  or  over net sales of million 
the sales increase reflected the company s recent acquisitions  which contributed million  all to associated spring s sales  as well as organic growth in associated spring 
this growth was partially offset by an decline in sales at barnes aerospace  the result of the sharp decline in the commercial aerospace markets  and a sales decline at barnes distribution 
the decline at barnes distribution reflects the impact of adverse conditions in the manufacturing  industrial and transport services market sectors 
expenses and operating income in millions change change cost of sales sales gross profit sales selling and administrative expenses sales operating income sales operating income was million in  an increase of compared with million in these results reflect the higher operating profit at barnes distribution  more fully discussed in the financial performance by business segment section below 
overall operating income margin increased to in compared with in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to reflecting improvements in gross profit margins at barnes distribution combined with the shift in overall sales mix to the higher margin distribution business  the result of the kar acquisition 
total selling and administrative expenses increased to as a percentage of sales  from in this increase was also driven by the higher proportion of sales in the distribution business  which has a higher selling expense component 
impacting both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses were higher postretirement benefit expenses at associated spring and lower pension income company wide 
pension income decreased by million due primarily to reduced investment performance of plan assets in and and a lower discount rate 
the cost of postretirement benefits  other than pensions  increased million due in part to a higher medical cost trend  lower discount rate and the full year impact of increased benefit levels provided to certain us employees 
operating income was million in  an increase of compared with million in these results reflect higher operating profit at associated spring and barnes distribution 
the year over year increase in operating profit was impacted positively by a million pretax business consolidation charge  relating primarily to the associated spring segment  taken in the fourth quarter of  which did not recur in in addition  operating income in benefited from efficiencies gained from the actions taken in this business consolidation 
these improvements were partially offset by lower profits at barnes aerospace due to lower sales volume and additional severance expense  higher postretirement benefit expense at associated spring and lower pension income company wide 
pension income decreased by million due primarily to reduced investment performance of plan assets and a lower discount rate 
the cost of postretirement benefits  other than pensions  increased million due to a lower discount rate and increased benefit levels provided to certain us employees 
other income expense other income totaled million in  compared with million in and million in included in other income in are foreign exchange gains of approximately million 
this compares to foreign exchange losses of approximately million in  which have been included in other expenses 
these foreign exchange transaction losses related primarily to exposures on us dollar denominated financial instruments  primarily in the company s operation in brazil 
the company s policy is to hedge foreign currency transaction exposure except in locations where the local currency has historically weakened against the us dollar  which includes both mexico and brazil 
this decrease in foreign exchange transaction income was partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates in brazil and increased short term investments in canada 
the decrease in other income in  compared with  was due to foreign exchange transaction gains of million in compared with gains of million in  offset by higher equity income from the company s nasco joint venture 
interest expense increased in as a result of higher borrowings related primarily to the kar acquisition  and a reduction in the amount of debt subject to variable interest rate swaps 
lower interest expense in  compared with  was a result of lower market interest rates and a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement that collectively more than offset the impact of an increase in average borrowings 
other expense declined in due to an accounting change that eliminated goodwill amortization of million in income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  compared with in and in the decline in the tax rate in was due to the reversal of tax reserves associated with a brazilian tax matter which was resolved in and minimum asset tax carryforwards in mexico which management now believes will be utilized in the near future 
these benefits were partially offset by the absence in of an additional deduction which was taken during for the company s retirement savings plan dividends 
the dividend deduction resulted from a retroactive election in for the dividend distribution  pursuant to an amendment to the plan 
excluding the two discrete tax benefit items recognized in  the effective tax rate would have been in net income and net income per share in millions  except per share change change net income net income per share basic diluted an increase in both basic and diluted average outstanding shares adversely impacted the increase in earnings per share when compared to the increase in net income 
the increase in shares results from the issuance of million shares of company common stock in a may  follow on public offering and issuance of million company shares in the acquisition of kar 
while the average shares outstanding were million for  total outstanding shares at december  were million 
therefore  absent any significant repurchases of the company s common stock  basic average outstanding shares for will exceed million shares 
financial performance by business segment barnes distribution in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin barnes distribution achieved record level sales of over million for  a increase over kar  which the company purchased on february   contributed million of sales in excluding kar  sales at barnes distribution were up  reflecting the positive impact on sales from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
growth initiatives  including national and regional customer development efforts  e commerce platforms and tier relationships together contributed approximately million in sales 
these gains were offset by a decrease in other customer segments 
barnes distribution s raymond business reported higher year over year sales  the result of product line expansion and higher sales in markets outside the us barnes distribution s operating profit increased significantly over the improvement in operating results was driven primarily by incremental operating profit contributed by kar 
operating results also include an incremental gain of million from the sales of distribution centers  which was partially offset by million of incremental severance expense 
in addition  barnes distribution s operating profit included other one time costs of approximately million associated with the integration of kar into the base business 
these one time costs were more than offset by the realization of estimated cost savings of million 
management expects to complete the remaining integration activities  in the first half of outlook the outlook for markets served by barnes distribution is improving  but remains uncertain 
however  management anticipates that operating profit will continue to be positively impacted in by the contribution to profit from additional kar sales  reflecting the full year of ownership  as well as from further realization of the synergistic cost savings resulting from integrating kar into barnes distribution 
sales fell in due to weak economic conditions within the manufacturing and industrial sectors in the united states and many international markets  which have persisted since late this was partially offset by new sales initiatives  including an increased focus on national and regional account development  which generated more than million in sales during despite the year over year decline in sales  operating profit at barnes distribution increased to million from million in the increase largely reflects higher operating efficiency as synergies from the curtis acquisition were successfully realized 
operating profit also benefited from an improvement in gross profit margin stemming from selective price increases and lower product procurement costs 
associated spring in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin associated spring achieved record sales of million in this increase over reflected incremental sales from the acquisitions combined with the positive impact on sales  primarily in europe  from the strengthening of foreign currency against the us dollar and higher sales of nitrogen gas springs 
incremental sales in from the acquisitions of seeger orbis in february and spectrum in april were million 
offsetting these increases were declines in sales in the north american light vehicle market  a drop in sales related to a planned withdrawal from the heavy truck brake spring market  and lower sales in the asian telecommunications electronics market 
in  associated spring outperformed the decline in north american light vehicle production 
associated spring s operating profit decreased in and reflected an operating margin  compared to in profits in were positively impacted by increased sales in europe  the closure of the texas plant in and the absence of million of one time costs related to purchase accounting adjustments recorded in however  overall margins were dampened by a decrease in sales in the higher margin telecommunications electronics market  approximately million of higher personnel costs  including pension  postretirement and medical costs  and a million reduction in the carrying value of the texas facility  held for sale at year end 
outlook the outlook for the markets served by associated spring is somewhat upbeat as an improving us economy is expected to positively impact both its transportation and industrial customers 
management is less optimistic about a recovery in the telecommunications electronics markets 
on the cost side  associated spring is facing pressure from raw material prices  most notably steel  and will be negotiating two labor union agreements which expire in the first half of any resulting cost increases or labor actions could negatively impact profit margins 
personnel costs related to pension  post retirement and medical costs are expected to increase in  but at a rate significantly lower than sales in increased over due to higher light vehicle production in the domestic transportation markets as well as from incremental sales from the acquisitions of forward industries  seeger orbis and spectrum  which in the aggregate totaled million 
offsetting these increases was a sharp drop in organic sales of telecommunications and electronics products  as sales to those end markets fell by over in domestic sales at associated spring grew by approximately in  while international sales increased by approximately to million 
sales grew sharply in europe in  reflecting the seeger orbis acquisition and organic growth in nitrogen gas spring sales from sweden  but were lower in asia  reflecting the weakness in the telecommunications and electronics markets 
the increase in operating profit in reflects the higher sales volume  higher profits resulting from actions taken since late to reduce the business s cost structure  operational improvements  particularly in mexico  and the absence of a million charge taken in to reduce the business unit s infrastructure 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of more profitable telecommunications and electronics products  and one time costs related to the purchase accounting step up of inventory to fair value at seeger orbis 
in  the closure of the texas spring plant was completed  with retained business from the texas plant being relocated to other associated spring facilities  improving their capacity utilization 
barnes aerospace in millions change change sales operating profit operating margin the decline in barnes aerospace sales for reflects the decline in commercial aircraft deliveries compared to the events of triggered the fall off in the commercial airline market but not before barnes aerospace reported a record million in sales in since  barnes aerospace has worked aggressively to expand into other markets including military and land based turbines 
approximately million  or  of sales were to the military or land based turbine markets 
total orders for were million  compared with million in and million in stronger orders in the second half of were driven by a large commercial engine program that will enter service in early and an increase in direct military orders 
the company entered into two revenue sharing program agreements that are expected to generate over million in orders and sales in order backlog declined marginally to million at december   from million at december  both orders and order backlog were affected by the same factors that negatively impacted sales 
outlook based upon published data  recovery in the sales of commercial aircraft is anticipated in this should impact aerospace component suppliers beginning in sales in are expected to improve over on the strength of sales from a large commercial engine program  higher military sales  the rsps and higher overhaul and repair sales 
more significant improvements are anticipated for if the aerospace industry enters a more robust recovery 
in  barnes aerospace margins increased and total operating profit dollars equaled  despite the significant drop in sales volume 
the improvement in margin is a result of headcount reductions and other productivity actions taken at barnes aerospace throughout aimed at positioning the business for a period of lower commercial aerospace volume 
in management addressed what it believed to be a protracted recovery in the aerospace industry by reducing employment by approximately  resulting in severance expenses of million 
this significant reduction in costs effectively positioned barnes aerospace to report operating profits in in line with  while sales declined nearly 
sales in were down from a record million in that sales decline reflected the sharp decrease in new commercial aircraft deliveries and continued aircraft order cancellations or deferrals by the major airlines in the wake of the events of operating profit fell in primarily as a result of the sales volume  combined with severance expense 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate bank lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital and anticipates that operating activities in will provide sufficient cash to take advantage of opportunities for organic business expansion and to meet the company s current financial commitments 
future acquisitions are expected to be financed through a mix of internal cash  borrowing and equity 
cash flow in millions change change operating activities investing activities financing activities nm exchange rate effect nm increase decrease in cash nm nm not meaningful operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating nearly million in cash over the last three years 
the improvement in operating cash flow in resulted from improved operating results compared with while management consistently stresses the need for effective working capital management  in an additional investment of million was required in working capital to support the operating needs of the businesses 
in  significant progress was made in reducing inventory levels  primarily at barnes distribution and barnes aerospace 
accounts payable decreased in part due to reduced inventory purchases  combined with the impact  in  of aggressive working capital management at the end of the significant increase in cash used by investing activities in compared with was due to the acquisition of kar in february investing activities in included the acquisitions of seeger orbis and spectrum 
investing activities in also included a million participation fee payment related to the rsps which are more fully discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
this payment was funded with cash held outside the united states 
the company has a remaining liability for million of which million will be paid in april also using cash held outside the united states 
the company s capital spending program focuses on business growth and improvements in productivity and quality 
in the past three years  capital spending was reduced in response to the economic downturn 
the company expects to increase capital spending in to an amount in the range of approximately million 
cash from financing activities in included proceeds from additional borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement that were used to fund the kar acquisition and certain operating cash flow requirements in the united states 
the company s public offering of its common stock provided proceeds of approximately million net of expenses incurred that were used to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company realized million in proceeds from the purchase of company stock through employee stock plans 
in  excess cash was used to reduce borrowings by million 
cash from financing activities in included million of cash proceeds from the termination of an interest rate swap 
cash dividends remained at per share for the third year 
total cash used to pay dividends increased in by million to million due to the increase in shares outstanding 
other financing activities in include the first of two million installment payments made in connection with the spectrum acquisition 
in proceeds from the sale of a cross currency debt swap  combined with strong cash flow from operating activities  were used in part to fund investing activities  pay dividends  repurchase the company s stock and reduce debt 
in  the company s positive cash flows increased cash and cash equivalents by million 
this cash in large part is generated by the company s non us subsidiaries 
as of december   nearly all of the company s cash and cash equivalents are held by the company s non us subsidiaries 
since the repatriation of this cash to the us could have adverse tax consequences  the balances remain outside the us to fund future international growth investments  including acquisitions 
the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
at december   the company had a million borrowing facility under a three year revolving credit agreement that matures on june   of which million was borrowed at an interest rate of 
additionally  the company had million in borrowings under uncommitted short term bank credit lines  at an interest rate of borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants 
the most restrictive covenant requires the company to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  of not more than times at december  the ratio requirement will decrease to times at june  the actual ratio at december  was times and would have allowed additional borrowings of million 
the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
in  the value of pension plan securities traded in equity markets increased significantly  which had a positive impact on the funded status of the plans 
partially offsetting these gains was the impact of declines in long term interest rates 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  employers accounting for pensions  the company initially recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment for under funded plans as of december   through a non cash after tax charge of million to accumulated other non owner changes to equity 
as of december   the under funded status of the plans improved  resulting in a reduction of million of this non cash after tax charge to equity 
from a cash perspective  approximately million in cash contributions were made by the company to its various pension plans in no company contribution was required and no cash contribution was made to any of the us qualified pension plans 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its various plans in contractual cash obligations and commitments at december   the company had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments in millions total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations expected pension contributions other long term obligations reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total the amounts exclude the fair value of an interest rate swap and the deferred gain on a terminated swap 
the amounts do not include purchase obligations already reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the purchase obligation amount includes all outstanding purchase orders as of the balance sheet date as well as the minimum contractual obligation or termination penalty under other contracts 
the amounts for are not required contributions  but reflect anticipated contributions to the company s various pension plans 
other matters inflation management believes that during the period  inflation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the last in  first out lifo method is used to value the majority of domestic inventories 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the excess inventoriable costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas management completed this annual assessment during the second quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  particularly with respect to integrating acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company pays participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program 
the value of the intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
in accordance with sfas  the company evaluates the remaining useful life of this asset to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
reorganization of businesses for non acquisition related reorganizations as of and subsequent to january   the company records the cost of reorganization initiatives at the time the liability is incurred 
for reorganization initiatives in connection with acquisitions  and for all other reorganization initiatives prior to january   the company records liabilities at the time that management has approved and committed to a reorganization plan 
such a plan identifies all significant actions to be taken and specifies an expected completion date that is within a reasonable period of time 
the liability includes those costs that can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates are subject to adjustments based upon actual costs incurred 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
in  the portfolio managers authorized to invest pension trust funds were changed and the mix of assets in which managers invest was revised 
the following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments  by asset classification  along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long term projected rates of return 
target asset mix annual return historical long term projection asset class large cap growth large cap value small cap growth small cap value non us equity real estate related fixed income cash weighted average historical returns based on the life of the respective index  approximately to years 
the historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices 
the target for fixed income and cash investments is lower than the fixed income and cash component of a typical pension trust 
the fixed income investments include a higher than average component of yield aggressive investments  including high yield corporate bonds 
based on the overall historical and projected rates of return  management is projecting the long term rate of return on pension assets to be 
a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the company s pretax income by approximately million annually 
a one quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s pretax income by approximately million annually 
the company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually 
during  the fair value of the company s pension plan assets increased by million compared to an increase in projected benefit obligations of million 
the company s pension expense for was million 
we expect pension expense for to increase by million over expense  primarily due to the reduction in the assumed discount rate from to and the methodology for recognizing return on plan assets 
income taxes as of december   the company had recognized million of deferred tax assets  net of valuation reserves 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the recognized net deferred tax asset is based on the company s estimates of future taxable income 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels
