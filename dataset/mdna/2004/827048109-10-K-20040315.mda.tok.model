item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading north american manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  metal  composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately percent in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for personal care products and a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales at a compounded annual rate of percent over the past ten years  largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
however  in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we expect to use our cash flow to repay debt or for other permitted purposes 
sales growth we have increased sales and market share in our metal food container and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and  particularly in our plastic container business  internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past sixteen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  birds eye and campbell  as well as our recent acquisition of pacific coast can  reflect this trend 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top tm easy open ends 
we anticipate that the market will decline slightly in the future  despite increased demand for convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sixfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions  including most recently thatcher tubes  as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container business of the consumer goods packaging industry is a highly fragmented business with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the part of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
with our acquisition of thatcher tubes in  we extended our business into decorated plastic tubes primarily for personal care products to complement our plastic container business 
we also expect to continue to generate internal growth in our plastic container business 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
additionally  our metal food container business has entered into a long term technical agreement with daiwa can company  or daiwa  of tokyo  japan 
daiwa is a major producer of metal food and beverage containers as well as plastic containers for cosmetics and foods in japan  and our relationship with daiwa gives us access to manufacturing processes and materials technologies that have been exclusively developed by daiwa 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top tm easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to maintain our market position  improve our productivity  reduce our manufacturing costs and invest in new market opportunities 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers 
recently  our plastic container business began to experience increased competitive pressures from new market entrants focused on larger customers in value added markets 
as a result  our plastic container business extended the term of several major supply agreements with various customers  but at lower prices  and elected not to meet competitive bids for some products 
we estimate that approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales in and a majority of our projected plastic container sales in will be under multi year arrangements 
many of these multi year supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  and to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in so using leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
in the absence of such acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our cash flow to repay debt or for other permitted purposes 
as we announced after completing three acquisitions in early  we intend to focus on reducing debt over the next few years 
we stated that our debt at year end would increase by only approximately million over year end despite spending approximately million for these acquisitions  excluding certain acquired inventory  and paying million in redemption premiums in connection with the redemption of our senior subordinated debentures due  or our debentures 
in fact  our year end debt increased by only million as compared to additionally  as we also announced  in the absence of compelling acquisitions  we intend to continue to focus on reducing our debt and expect to further reduce our debt by million over the next three years  of which at least million is expected in to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  our aggregate interest and other debt expense was percent of our income from operations as compared to percent  percent  percent and percent for    and  respectively 
in  we took advantage of favorable debt markets and refinanced all million principal amount of our outstanding debentures with lower cost notes  incremental term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement and funds from operations 
due to this refinancing  in we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the premium paid in connection with the redemption of the debentures and for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premium related to the debentures 
as a result of this refinancing  we expect significantly lower interest expense in as compared to acquisitions in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of thatcher tubes  a privately held manufacturer and marketer of decorated plastic tubes serving primarily the personal care industry 
including additional production capacity installed shortly before the acquisition  the purchase price for the assets was approximately million in cash 
thatcher tubes had annual net sales of approximately million in thatcher tubes operates as part of our plastic container business and extends our personal care business into decorated plastic tubes 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in white cap that we did not already own from amcor white cap  inc for approximately million in cash 
additionally  we refinanced debt of white cap and purchased equipment subject to a third party lease for approximately million 
the business now operates under the name silgan closures and is a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
white cap had annual net sales of approximately million in the business operates as part of our metal food container business 
in april  we acquired pacific coast can  a subsidiary of pacific coast  which self manufactured a majority of its metal food container requirements 
this acquisition continued the trend of food processors selling their metal food container manufacturing businesses 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash  including approximately million for inventory 
as part of the transaction  we entered into a ten year supply agreement with pacific coast under which pacific coast has agreed to purchase from us substantially all of its metal food container requirements 
pacific coast can operates as part of our metal food container business

after contributing our metal closures business to the white cap joint venture in  we reported the results of that business separately for periods prior to the formation of white cap 
after our acquisition of white cap in  we report the results of silgan closures as part of our metal food container business 
as a result  for we have included the results of the metal closures business with our metal food container business 
the metal closures business had net sales of million and income from operations of million in year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to primarily as a result of the inclusion of three businesses acquired during early these acquisitions represent a continued strengthening of our franchise market positions  bringing our unit volume market share in the united states metal food can market to over percent  putting us in a leadership position in the metal  composite and plastic vacuum closure market for food and beverage products and further extending our product line to plastic tubes for the personal care market 
income from operations in also increased as compared to  despite the inclusion of million of rationalization charges in and million of rationalization credits in operating margin in declined by percentage points as compared to as a result of rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in and the inclusion of the acquired silgan closures business 
silgan closures had lower operating margins than the rest of the metal food container business as it continues to execute a major restructuring program initiated prior to our acquisition of the business 
net income in of million  or per diluted share  declined by per diluted share as compared to as a result of rationalization charges of million  or per diluted share  and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  or per diluted share 
both the plant rationalizations and  more importantly  the refinancing of our debt are expected to be accretive to our results in and beyond 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was largely the result of higher net sales of the metal food container business due to the recently acquired businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of net sales of the white cap closures and pacific coast can businesses 
net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily a result of higher unit volume due largely to the acquisition of thatcher tubes and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of increased resin costs 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit margin for as compared to was principally due to increased sales of value added products  largely offset by heightened competitive activities in the plastic container business  inflation in employee benefit costs and higher depreciation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales for as compared to was largely due to higher levels of such expenses in the recently acquired white cap closures and thatcher tubes businesses  inflation in employee benefits costs and the favorable impact in of net payments received in settlement for certain litigation 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to while operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the increase in income from operations would have been million higher were it not for rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in during  we recorded rationalization charges totaling million including the non cash write down in carrying value of assets of approximately million related to closing two plastic container manufacturing facilities and one metal closure manufacturing facility 
we recorded rationalization credits in totaling million 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the increase in income from operations was principally due to the inclusion of the results of the recently acquired businesses  increased sales of quick top tm easy open ends and improved operating efficiencies  partially offset by rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in  higher depreciation expense and inflation in employee benefit costs 
the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to rationalization charges in as compared to rationalization credits in and the inclusion of the results of silgan closures 
income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent 
the decreases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily a result of rationalization charges in as compared to a rationalization credit in  increased pricing pressures due to heightened competitive activities  higher depreciation expense and inflation in employee benefits costs  partially offset by higher unit volume and improved productivity 
operating margin was negatively impacted as higher sales associated with higher resin costs did not result in a corresponding increase in income from operations 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense in increased million to million as compared to this increase resulted primarily from a million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of refinancing all million of the debentures and higher average borrowings during the year due to three acquisitions completed in early  partially offset by a lower average interest rate in interest and other debt expense for included a million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales in increased million  or percent  as compared to primarily as a result of higher unit volume in the metal food container business due to new business awarded and a stronger fruit and vegetable pack 
income from operations increased by million and operating margin increased to percent due to the increased volume  rationalization credits in as compared to rationalization charges in and the elimination of goodwill amortization 
partially offsetting these improvements were price adjustments related to certain contract negotiations  higher depreciation expense  higher costs to initially absorb new business and the impact of contributing the metal closures business to the white cap joint venture in july as a result  net income for was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for net income for included rationalization credits of million  or per diluted share  equity in losses of white cap of million  or per diluted share  and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  or per diluted share 
net income for included net rationalization charges of million  or per diluted share  a gain on assets contributed to the white cap joint venture of million  or per diluted share  equity in losses of packtion corporation  a dissolved e commerce venture  of million  or per diluted share  and equity in losses of white cap of million  or per diluted share 
net sales 
consolidated net sales increased million  or percent  for as compared to this increase was largely the result of higher net sales of the metal food container business and  to a lesser extent  of the plastic container business  partially offset by the impact of contributing the metal closure business to the white cap joint venture in july net sales of the metal closure business in were million 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  for as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher unit volume principally as a result of new business on the west coast and a stronger fruit and vegetable pack as compared to  partially offset by the impact of contributing the metal closure business to the white cap joint venture in july net sales for the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  from this increase was primarily a result of higher unit volume due primarily to new business  partially offset by lower average selling prices due principally to the pass through of lower resin costs and a less favorable sales mix 
gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit margin for as compared to was principally due to the effect of price adjustments related to certain contract negotiations  higher manufacturing costs to initially absorb new business in the metal food container business and higher depreciation expense  partially offset by higher volume and the elimination of goodwill amortization in both the metal food container and the plastic container businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales for as compared to was primarily due to net payments received in settlement of certain litigation in  partially offset by higher selling and commercial development expenses in the plastic container business 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent 
income from operations and operating margin were higher in both the metal food container and plastic container businesses 
we recorded rationalization credits in totaling million and net rationalization charges of million in income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were principally due to higher volume  rationalization credits in as compared to net rationalization charges in and the elimination of goodwill amortization  partially offset by the effect of price adjustments relating to certain contract negotiations  the impact of contributing the metal closures business to the white cap joint venture in july  higher depreciation expense  higher manufacturing costs to initially absorb new business  start up costs related to the manufacture of convenience ends and increased employee health and welfare costs 
income from operations of the metal closures business in was million 
income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were primarily a result of higher volumes  a rationalization charge recorded in  the elimination of goodwill amortization and improved operational efficiencies  partially offset by higher depreciation expense  higher selling and commercial development expenses and higher employee health and welfare costs 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense decreased million in as compared to this decrease resulted primarily from a lower average interest rate and approximately million in lower average borrowings during as compared to despite an add on issuance of million of debentures and higher interest rate spreads over libor  we experienced a lower average interest rate in as compared to as a result of lower libor rates 
interest and other debt expense for included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our previous senior secured credit facility 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  required us to eliminate the amortization of goodwill effective january  for  we recorded goodwill amortization of approximately million  or per diluted share 
during  the metal food container and plastic container businesses benefited from the elimination of million and million  respectively  of goodwill amortization 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under the credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
during  we amended the credit agreement to  among other things  increase the uncommitted incremental term loan facility by million and provide us with greater ability to redeem our debentures or any other subordinated indebtedness 
in march  we completed a million incremental term loan borrowing under the credit agreement and used the proceeds largely to finance the acquisitions of white cap and thatcher tubes 
in december  we completed an additional million incremental term loan borrowing under the credit agreement and used the proceeds and other funds to redeem outstanding debentures 
the terms of these incremental term loans are the same as those for b term loans under the credit agreement 
our uncommitted incremental term loan facility under the credit agreement at december  was million 
in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
the issue price for the notes was of their principal amount 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinate in right of payment to obligations under the credit agreement and effectively subordinate to all obligations of the subsidiaries of the company 
interest on the notes will be payable semi annually in cash on the th day of each may and november 
the net cash proceeds from this issuance and other funds were used to redeem our debentures 
during  we redeemed all million of our outstanding debentures 
the redemption price was of the principal amount  or million  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
we funded this redemption with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  incremental term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement and funds from operations 
as a result of this redemption  we expect significantly lower interest expense in as compared to we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million in for the premium paid in connection with this redemption and for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premium related to the redeemed debentures 
this loss on early extinguishment of debt was recorded as interest and other debt expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in  we used cash from incremental term loan borrowings of million  cash from operations of million  proceeds from the issuance of the notes of million  cash balances of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  proceeds from asset sales of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to redeem the debentures for million  purchase businesses for million  fund capital expenditures of million  repay term loans under the credit agreement of million and pay debt issuance costs of million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net  inventories and trade accounts payable increased primarily due to acquisitions completed in the increase in inventories was partially offset by a successful finished goods inventory reduction program in our metal food container business 
in  we used proceeds of million from an add on issuance of debentures  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and proceeds from asset sales of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of revolving loans and long term debt of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net decreased million to million as compared to  primarily due to the timing of sales 
inventories increased million to million in as compared to primarily due to the timing of sales and raw material purchases 
in  we used cash generated from operations of million  cash proceeds from the white cap joint venture of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  cash balances of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of revolving loans and long term debt of million and our investment in packtion of million 
as of december   there were million of revolving loans outstanding under the credit agreement  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the available portion of the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement was million 
revolving loans under the credit agreement may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed until their final maturity on june  the credit agreement also provided us with a term loans million outstanding at december  and b term loans million outstanding at december   which are required to be repaid in annual installments through june  and november   respectively 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
under the credit agreement  the interest rate for all loans will be either the eurodollar rate plus a margin or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank trust company americas plus a margin 
the margins are subject to adjustment quarterly based upon financial ratios set forth in the credit agreement 
because we sell metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years taking into account recent acquisitions will consist primarily of o annual capital expenditures of to million  o annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the credit agreement of million and the repayment in of million of revolving loans outstanding under the credit agreement at year end  o our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  and o payments of approximately million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which will increase annually thereafter 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
the credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt obligations  operating lease obligations purchase obligations total  these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
minimum pension funding requirements and other postretirement benefit plan funding are not included as such amounts have not been determined 
based on current tax law  the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately million in however  this estimate is subject to change based on current tax proposals before congress  as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
during  we made pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions of approximately million  of which approximately million represented minimum funding requirements 
at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had billion of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate was exchanged for fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent 
at december   the aggregate notional principal amounts of these agreements was million including million notional principal amount that became effective on january   with million aggregate notional principal amount of these agreements maturing in and million aggregate notional principal amount of these agreements maturing in each of  and depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges credits and acquisition reserves during  we established acquisition reserves in connection with our purchases of thatcher tubes  white cap and pacific coast can aggregating approximately million  recorded pursuant to plans that we began to assess and formulate at the date of the acquisitions and which will be finalized during the first quarter of as we continue to assess  formulate and finalize our integration plans  there may be revisions to these acquisition reserves during the first quarter of currently  these plans include exiting the lodi  california metal food container manufacturing facility  the chicago  illinois and queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facilities and the culiacan  mexico plastic container manufacturing facility 
these plans include the termination of approximately plant and administrative employees and other related plant exit costs 
these reserves consisted of employee severance and benefits costs of million and plant exit costs of million related to the planned closing of the previously discussed acquired facilities 
through december   a total of million and million has been expended for employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs related to these plans  respectively 
at december   these reserves had an aggregate balance of million 
cash payments related to these reserves are expected through during  we approved and announced to employees plans to exit our norwalk  connecticut and anaheim  california plastic container manufacturing facilities and our queretaro  mexico metal closures manufacturing facility 
these plans include the termination of approximately plant employees and other related exit costs 
these decisions resulted in a charge to earnings of million  which consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  million for employee severance and benefits costs and million for plant exit costs 
through december   a total of million and million has been expended for employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs  respectively 
at december   these reserves had an aggregate balance of million 
additional rationalization charges related to these facility closings are expected in the first quarter of the timing of certain cash payments is dependent upon the expiration of a lease obligation 
accordingly  cash payments related to these reserves are expected through we recorded rationalization credits in totaling million 
these rationalization credits included million related primarily to the decision to support new business requirements by continuing to operate our kingsburg  california metal food container facility that was previously expected to be closed  million related primarily to certain previously written down assets of the metal food container business that were placed back in service to meet business requirements and million related to certain aspects of a rationalization plan to close a plastic container manufacturing facility that were completed at amounts less than originally estimated 
in  we recorded net rationalization charges totaling million 
these net rationalization charges included a million charge in the metal food container business  comprised of a charge of million  including million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  primarily relating to the planned closing of two metal food container manufacturing facilities including our kingsburg  california facility and a million credit as a result of certain assets of the metal food container business that were placed back in service  and a million charge related to closing our fairfield  ohio plastic container manufacturing facility 
under our rationalization and acquisition plans  we made cash payments of million  million and million  respectively in  and additional cash spending is expected in under our acquisition plans  rationalization plans and fairfield rationalization plan 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for deferred income taxes  pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges credits and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
at december   cs can had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  that expire between and  for which no valuation allowance has been established 
these nols are available to offset future taxable income of cs can 
we believe that it is more likely than not that these nols will be available to reduce future income tax liabilities based on estimated future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences in future periods 
current levels of cs can pre tax earnings are sufficient to generate the taxable income required to realize our deferred tax assets 
we would reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it became more likely than not that a portion of these nols would not be utilized 
if a valuation allowance were established  additional expense would be recorded within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which that determination was made 
this process requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  we reduced our discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  and  we assumed that the expected return on our pension plan assets was percent 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates

requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have limited foreign currency risk associated primarily with our canadian operations and risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing cost 
to achieve our objectives  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our total debt  respectively 
we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under the credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  our foreign activities are conducted primarily in canada 
since we do not have significant foreign operations  we do not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
commodity pricing risk we purchase commodities for our products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage up to a significant portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during and  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outlines the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our natural gas swap agreements
