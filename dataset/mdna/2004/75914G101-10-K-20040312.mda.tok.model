overview we are a provider of global domain name registration  website  email and other internet services for businesses and consumers that wish to have a unique address and branded identity on the internet 
domain names serve as addresses and identities on the world wide web 
they enable a business or person to establish an internet presence and are integral to the use of websites eg  www 
register 
com  email eg  johndoe register 
com and other types of internet based services we began processing domain name registrations in the generic top level domains gtlds 
com  
net and 
org in june and  as such  were the first registrar accredited by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann to compete in the domain name registration market after icann introduced competition in the industry 
we had approximately million active domain name registrations under management as of december   representing approximately million customers 
currently  we register  renew and transfer domain names in tlds such as 
com  
net  
org  
biz  
info and 
name and in over country code top level domains cctlds  including 
de for germany and 
jp for japan and sub domains  such as 
co 
uk and 
org 
uk for the united kingdom 
we believe that we offer a quick and user friendly domain name registration process as well as responsive and reliable customer support 
we also assist our customers in further developing and maintaining their internet presence by offering them a range of website  email and other value added products and services 
domain name registration activity is driven by the use of the internet by businesses and consumers for electronic commerce and communication  the promotion  marketing and protection of brands and identities across the world and other online activities 
our mission is to become the preferred provider of domain names  website  email and other internet services for customers seeking to build  manage and promote their online presence 
our retail division focuses on small to medium sized businesses and individuals 
generally  these customers purchase domain name registration services and other value added services directly from our website located at www 
register 
com 
in addition to our retail division  we maintain a corporate services division 
our corporate services division provides domain name registration and related products and services  including global registration and management services and online brand and trademark protection  to large corporate enterprises with specialized registration needs 
in order to extend the distribution reach of our products and services  we also maintain a global partner network gpn wholesale division which works with companies that resell our domain name registration and web services to their customers using our software solutions 
our gpn partners are typically internet service providers isps  web hosting companies  telecom carriers and web portals  but also include online and offline retailers and business aggregators 
using our software solutions  these companies resell our domain name registration services and related products and services to their customers 
in june  we acquired inabox  inc for million cash and  shares of our common stock  and we used inabox s software to develop our firststepsite and websitenow tm products and my 
register 
com  one of the reseller solutions offered to our global partner network 
in september  we acquired afternic 
com  inc  a secondary market exchange for domain names  for million cash and  shares of our common stock 
each of these transactions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the financial results of inabox and afternic 
com are consolidated with our financial results from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
we made a decision to abandon the afternic business in september in march  we acquired virtual internet plc  a uk based company  for million us million at the date of acquisition  which had operations in the united states and europe and operated through two divisions the corporate services division and the hosting division 
the corporate services division provides domain name registration and online intellectual property management and protection services  and the hosting division provided web hosting services 
in may  we sold the hosting division for million 
our results of operations include virtual internet s corporate services division subsequent to march  in  we changed the name of virtual internet to register 
com europe plc rcom europe 
in late  we began a restructuring program to address the challenges facing our business 
the primary goal of our restructuring program is to introduce new systems that will enable us to operate our business more efficiently 
for our retail division  we are building a new and more flexible systems architecture which we believe will enable us to introduce new products and services more rapidly and cost effectively and to improve our operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
we believe that by making our technology architecture more flexible and efficient we will achieve these goals 
for our corporate services division  we are developing a system to automate as much of the order processing and fulfillment for cctld registrations as possible 
we anticipate that our new corporate services system will enable us take sales orders and fulfill them on a more highly automated basis  thereby reducing our costs and increasing our efficiency and accuracy 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we have also relocated some of our groups and operations to our canadian facility  where the overhead and labor costs are lower than in our other locations 
in addition  in february  we sold our registrypro business  which had been given icann approval to operate the 
pro registry 
we sold this business because we believe that operating a registry would have distracted us and taken time  energy and resources from our core business of operating a registrar and selling related value added products and services 
significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
our most significant estimates relate to potential refunds to customers and chargebacks from customers  the realizability of accounts receivable  fixed assets  intangible assets  and deferred tax assets  the potential liability to credit card associations for penalties for credit card chargebacks and refunds in excess of certain thresholds  potential liability for various matters in litigation  and the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition  continual technology advances and new product service introductions  all of which could impact the future realizability of our assets 
net revenues we derive our net revenues from domain name registrations  other products and services and advertising 
we earn registration fees in connection with new  renewed  and transferred in registrations 
registration periods generally range from one to ten years 
domain name registration revenues are deferred at the time of the registration and are recognized ratably over the term of the registration period 
under this subscription based model  we recognize revenue over the period during which we provide the registration services  including customer service and maintenance of the individual domain name records 
we require prepayment at the time of sale via credit card for most online domain name registration sales  which provides us with the full cash fee at the beginning of the registration period whereas we recognize the revenues over the registration period 
for many of our customers who register domain names through our corporate services division  and many of the participants in our global partner network  we establish lines of credit based on credit worthiness 
under current credit card industry practices  we are liable for fraudulent and disputed credit card transactions because we do not obtain the cardholder s signature at the time of the transaction  even though the financial institution issuing the credit card may have approved the transaction 
as a result  we must estimate the amount of credit card chargebacks we will receive in the future related to credit card sales in the current period 
in determining our estimate  on a monthly basis we review historical rates of credit card chargebacks  current economic trends and changes in acceptance of our products and services 
deferred revenues and revenues recognized are presented net of provisions for estimated refunds to customers and chargebacks from customers 
the credit card associations may impose financial penalties if our chargebacks and or refunds exceed certain thresholds 
such penalties are not charged to revenues  but are classified as general and administrative expenses 
because the imposition of any potential penalties is at the discretion of the association  subject to contractual limitations  we have accrued amounts to cover what we estimate to be the maximum potential penalties that could be imposed under that association s rules 
if the penalty ultimately imposed is less than the maximum contractual amount  we would reverse any excess accounts previously accrued as a reduction of general and administrative expense at that time 
if a significant percentage of customers continue to request refunds from us or contact their bank to request that the amount we charged to their credit card be charged back to us based on claims that their credit card was used fraudulently or without their consent  our business could be materially adversely affected 
see risk factors and note to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies credit card penalties for additional information in connection with penalties that may be imposed by credit card associations and other risks associated with the company s credit card chargebacks and refunds 
in addition to our standard registration fees  many of which are published on our www 
register 
com website  we have a number of different fee structures for our domain name registration services 
our corporate services division delivers a diversified range of generally higher priced services for our corporate customers and also extends volume based discounts for domain name registrations and transfers 
we pay referral commissions to certain participants in our global partner network and to participants in our affiliate network 
other participants in our global partner network pay us a wholesale price per registration  discounted off of our standard registration fee 
we experienced a decrease in our total names under management to approximately million as of december  from approximately million as of december  other products and services  which primarily consist of email  domain name forwarding  web hosting  site submission to search engines  application processing fees for new gtlds  intellectual property protection services related to the introduction of new gtlds and software  and fees for modifying existing registrations  are sold either as one time offerings or through annual or monthly subscriptions  depending on the product or service 
revenues from our other products and services are recognized ratably over the period in which we provide such services 
revenues from processing fees for domain name applications  which may or may not result in domain name registrations  and other intellectual property protection services related to the introduction of new gtlds  are recognized immediately upon the sale of the services 
advertising revenues are derived from the sale of sponsorships and banner advertisements  typically under short term contracts that range from one month to one year in duration 
we recognize these revenues in the periods in which the advertisements are displayed or the required number of impressions are achieved  provided that no significant company obligation remains and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with providing domain name registrations and other products and services 
cost of revenues for domain name registrations represents amortization of registry fees on a straight line basis over the registration term  depreciation of the equipment used to process the domain name registrations  fees paid for co location facilities housing our equipment  and fees paid to the financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
cost of revenues does not include penalties for excessive credit card chargebacks and refunds  such penalties are classified as general and administrative expense 
we pay registry fees for gtlds ranging from per year for each 
biz and 
info domain name registration to per year for each 
com  
net and 
org domain name registration 
we pay registry fees ranging from to  per year for one to ten year country code domain name registrations 
the largest component of our cost of revenues is registry fees which  while paid in full at the time the domain name is registered  are recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized to cost of revenues ratably over the terms of the registrations 
cost of revenues for our other products and services consists of fees paid to third party service providers  depreciation of equipment used to deliver the services  fees paid for co location facilities housing our equipment  and fees paid to financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
cost of revenues for other products and services is recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
we have no direct cost of revenues associated with our advertising revenues and we have no incremental cost of revenues associated with delivering advertisements since we use the same equipment to deliver the advertisements as we use for our domain name registration services 
therefore  the gross profit margin on advertising revenue is  and accordingly  any decrease in advertising revenue would represent a reduction of our gross profit of the same amount 
we incur costs including salaries and commissions for our advertising sales staff  which are classified as operating expenses 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative including non cash compensation  and amortization of intangibles 
prior to january  our operating expenses also included amortization of goodwill  effective january  we adopted sfas and ceased amortization of goodwill 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  marketing programs such as advertising  and commissions paid to our sales representatives 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  fees for outside consultants  software licensing fees and related costs associated with the development and integration of new products and services  enhancement of existing products and services  and quality assurance 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation  include salaries and other personnel related expenses for executive  financial and administrative personnel  as well as professional fees  insurance premiums  penalties for excessive credit card chargebacks and refunds  and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
facilities costs are allocated across the various operating expense categories 
we account for non cash compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations 
non cash compensation expense relates to grants of restricted stock  stock options and warrants to employees  directors  consultants and vendors with exercise prices below fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
based on such grants through december   we expect to record approximately million in additional non cash compensation expense through as follows million in and million through non cash compensation expense will reduce our earnings or increase our losses  as applicable  in future periods 
we review our goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill and intangibles using estimated undiscounted cash flows 
these cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of the related amortization period 
we also compare the total market value of our common stock with the book value of our stockholders equity 
based on the foregoing factors  if we conclude that an other than temporary impairment of goodwill or intangibles has occurred  we record an impairment writedown 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax obligations and temporary differences resulting from timing differences for reporting items for financial statement and tax purposes  the most significant of which is deferred revenue 
we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when appropriate  based on management s judgment  to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
net income loss although we were profitable for the year  we were not profitable for the years or our net loss for included a goodwill impairment writedown and amortization of intangibles of million 
our net loss for included a goodwill impairment writedown of million 
although we have recently taken several initiatives intended to reduce our operating expenses in  we cannot assure you as to when or if these reductions will be realized 
losses at rcom europe and registrypro have contributed to a decline in our profitability 
we expect losses at rcom europe to impact our profitability negatively through the early part of the year and perhaps beyond 
we sold our registrypro business in february and  accordingly  we believe that registrypro will not have a significant negative impact on our profitability in or beyond 
in addition  unless we lower our credit card refunds and reduce our level of credit card chargebacks  we may continue to be potentially liable for significant penalties from credit card associations  which would impact our profitability see risk factors for additional information 
further  we anticipate that our revenues from advertising will be materially lower in future periods 
for all the above reasons  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate profitably or continue to generate positive cash flow in the future 
year compared with year net revenues total net revenues decreased to million in from million in domain name registrations 
recognition of revenues from domain name registrations decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to a lower number of domain names registered  and in part to lower average sale prices per year of subscription term 
these reductions were offset in part by the inclusion of rcom europe in our results of operations for the full year in as compared to  for which it was included from the date of acquisition march   revenues from rcom europe of million and million were recognized in and  respectively 
we may face continued pricing pressure in the future  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
other products and services 
revenues from other products and services increased to million in from million in the largest component of the increased revenues in this category was email services 
at december   our deferred revenue balance was million  compared with million at december   representing a decrease of million for the year our deferred revenue balance is an indicator of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
advertising 
revenues from advertising decreased to million in from million in from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of  our largest advertising customer  a provider of web hosting services  had accounted for approximately million of advertising revenues per quarter 
however in the fourth quarter of we began to offer web hosting services to our own customers  and decided to discontinue this advertising relationship 
accordingly  we did not sell advertising to this customer in the fourth quarter of and we do not expect to sell advertising to this customer in future periods 
accordingly  we anticipate that our annualized advertising revenue will decline by approximately million unless we can increase our advertising sales to other customers 
our sales of web hosting services directly to our own customers are classified as revenues from other products and services 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in cost of domain name registrations 
costs recognized for domain name registrations decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted primarily from a lower number of domain names registered in and a reduction of data center operations expenses 
cost of other products and services 
cost of other products and services increased to million in from million in in part as a result of increased revenues from other products and services in primarily email services  and in part because in we had received a million refund from the 
biz registry as a result of that registry s decision to cancel certain 
biz applications 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin increased to in from in  primarily as a result of lower costs of our data center operations  and in part due to increases in revenues from other products and services  which have a higher gross profit margin than domain name registration services 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to reductions in online and off line media spending 
we anticipate that our marketing expense will increase significantly in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from higher salaries and consulting fees for personnel working to improve our systems and operations 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to remain high during the first half of  and perhaps beyond  as we continue our efforts to upgrade and improve our systems 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to million of advisory fees and expenses incurred in in connection with our consideration of various strategic alternatives following the unsolicited acquisition proposals we received in early and in connection with the self tender offer for million of our common stock and warrants completed in september this was partially offset by lower accruals for potential credit card penalties million in versus million in  a decline of approximately million in bad debt expense as a result of improved collection efforts which reduced the level of past due receivables and the required reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables  and a decline of million in amortization of noncash compensation 
as of december  our balance sheet reflected an accrued liability of million for potential credit card penalties  which represents our estimate of the maximum potential penalties that could be imposed under one credit card association s rules for chargebacks and or refunds in excess of certain thresholds 
for additional information in connection with potential credit card penalties  see risk factors and note to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies credit card penalties 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million in compared with amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles of million in in september  we made a decision to abandon the afternic business 
as a consequence of that decision  as well as negative industry and economic trends affecting us and the general decline in technology company valuations  including the valuation of our common stock  we performed an impairment analysis of the goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
because the total market value of our common stock at september  was lower than the book value of our stockholders equity  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million in september also  in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill effective january  other income  net other income  net  which consisted primarily of interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates and in part to a reduction of million in our investment portfolio in connection with our self tender offer for million of our common stock and warrants completed in september provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million  representing an effective rate of of pre tax income 
this lower than statutory effective tax rate resulted primarily from our receipt of tax free interest income on our investment portfolio 
the provision for income taxes in was a benefit of million  representing an effective tax rate of of the pre tax loss 
this lower than statutory effective tax benefit resulted primarily from the fact that only a portion of the goodwill impairment writedown was tax deductible  and in part because no tax benefits were recorded in connection with losses generated by rcom europe  as realization was not assured 
earnings per share weighted average number of shares the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year was  shares basic and  shares diluted 
as a result of our completion in september of our million self tender offer  in which we purchased  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock based on the conversion of warrants on a cashless basis at the per share offer price  the weighted average number of shares declined in the fourth quarter of the lower number of shares outstanding will have the effect of increasing net income loss per share in future periods  however  interest income on our available cash and investment balances will be lower 
year compared with year net revenues total net revenues decreased to million in from million in domain name registrations 
recognition of revenues from domain name registrations decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due in part to lower average prices and a longer dollar weighted average subscription term for domain names registered in compared with  and in part to a writeoff related to credit card receivables in these reductions were offset in part by the inclusion of rcom europe in our results of operations after march   for which revenues of million were recognized in we may face continued pricing pressure 
at december   we had million of deferred revenue compared with million at december   representing an increase of million for the year the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of rcom europe on march   whose balance sheet included deferred revenue of million at the date of acquisition 
our deferred revenue balance is an indicator of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
other products and services 
revenues from other products and services decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to the non recurrence in of million of revenues received during from sales of intellectual property services in connection with the launch of new gtlds  offset in part by increased sales in of email and websitenow services 
advertising 
revenues from advertising decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of softness in the internet advertising market 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of domain name registrations 
costs recognized for domain name registrations increased to million in from million in the increase was due to the inclusion of rcom europe in our results of operations after march   for which costs of million were recognized in  more than offsetting the decreased cost of domain name registrations that resulted from lower registration revenues recognized in cost of other products and services 
cost of other products and services declined to million in from million  primarily because included million of costs related to sales of intellectual property services in connection with the launch of new gtlds  which did not recur in gross profit margin our gross profit margin declined to in from in  in part due to lower advertising revenues  in part to lower average prices and in part to fixed costs for depreciation and data center operations which comprised a higher percentage of the lower level of revenues 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower expenses related to media advertising  direct mail and other promotional activities  offset in part by the inclusion of rcom europe in our results of operations after march  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from higher salaries and consulting fees for personnel working to improve our systems and operations  and in part from increased costs for software licenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the higher expense level was due to i an increase of million in credit card penalties as a result of excessive chargebacks and refunds  of which million was paid and million was accrued to cover our estimate of potential penalties which could be imposed for under one card association s rules  ii the inclusion of million of expenses for rcom europe which was acquired march   iii an increase of million in bad debt expense  iv the costs of operating our customer service center in canada which commenced operations in the third quarter of  and v startup costs of million for registrypro 
for additional information in connection with credit card penalties  see risk factors and note to consolidated financial statements contingencies and commitments credit card penalties 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization and writedown of goodwill and other intangibles was million in compared with million in during we recorded a goodwill impairment writedown of million related to afternic  which was acquired in september in september  we made a decision to abandon the afternic business 
as a consequence of that decision  as well as negative industry and economic trends affecting us and the general decline in technology company valuations  including the valuation of our common stock  we performed an impairment analysis of the goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with its various acquisitions 
because the total market value of our common stock at september  was lower than the book value of its stockholders equity  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million in september also in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill effective january  other income  net other income  net  which consisted primarily of interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in was a benefit of million  representing an effective tax rate of of the pre tax loss 
that effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of in part because only a portion of the goodwill impairment writedown is tax deductible  in part because no tax benefits were recorded in connection with losses generated by rcom europe in the united kingdom as realization is not assured  and in part because a substantial portion of our interest income is exempt from taxes 
in  the provision for income taxes was an expense of million  rather than a benefit  because goodwill amortization and the impairment writedown recorded in were not tax deductible 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly statement of operations data  in dollar amounts and as percentages of net revenue  for the eight quarters ended december  in our opinion this information has been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report  and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in order to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations data 
the quarterly data should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

recent accounting pronouncements sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in june  and requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of covered costs are lease termination and certain employee severance 
sfas is applicable to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas was issued in december  providing for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair market value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  sales of equity securities and borrowings 
we issued  shares of our common stock to the public on march   which enabled us to raise approximately million in cash after deducting underwriting discount and other offering expenses 
in september  we used million of our cash  short term investments and marketable securities to complete a self tender offer in which we purchased  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock based on the conversion of warrants on a cashless basis at the per share offer price 
during  our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities declined by million  primarily as a result of our generation of million of cash from operations in  offset by million which we used for the self tender offer  million to retire notes payable issued in connection with our acquisition of rcom europe  and million for capital expenditures 
in we generated million of cash from operations  and we used million for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to represent a material use of our cash resources and we expect our expenses for research and development to increase during the first half of and perhaps beyond  and we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase for the full year and perhaps beyond 
we believe that our current balance of cash  short term investments and marketable securities together with anticipated cash to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  as a result of the consummation of our million self tender offer in september  when compared to our financial position prior to the self tender  we have significantly reduced our cash position and our future interest income  reduced our ability to engage in significant transactions without additional debt or equity financing  reduced our ability to cover existing contingent or other future liabilities  and potentially negatively impacted our liquidity during future periods of increased capital requirements or operating expenses 
under a prior registry agreement with icann  we had committed to provide up to million in funding and other non cash contributions to our subsidiary  registrypro  for its activities in establishing  operating and marketing the 
pro top level domain 
effective february   we sold the core assets of the registrypro business and icann agreed to the assignment of the registry agreement to the purchaser 
through december  we had contributed approximately million in cash  of which million was funded during  and we had also made non cash contributions which we have valued at approximately million 
in addition  the purchaser has agreed to assume million of this million commitment 
accordingly  we believe that we have satisfied our funding commitment in full  as well as our other obligations under the registry agreement  although we have not obtained a release of these obligations from icann 
a summary of our contractual obligations for operating leases and other commitments as of december  is as follows

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the board of directors had previously authorized a repurchase program for up to million of our common stock through october  and we had purchased  shares for a total of million through december  under this program 
in september  we completed a million self tender offer of our outstanding common stock and warrants 
we will not repurchase additional shares or our common stock unless the board of directors authorizes a new repurchase program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily related to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we believe that we are not subject to a material interest rate risk because substantially all of our investments are in fixed rate  short term securities having a maturity of not more than two years  with a majority having a maturity of less than one year 
accordingly  the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
from time to time we also invest in publicly traded stocks  and we are subject to market price risk with respect to such investments 
at december  the fair value of our investments in publicly traded stocks was million 
we did not have any foreign currency hedging or derivative instruments at december  we generally do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
while we have no present intention of utilizing derivative financial instruments in the future  it is possible that we may enter into such transactions or similar transactions 
at december  we had no long term debt 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
we derived of our net revenues in from operations outside of the united states 
we face foreign currency risks in part because our european subsidiaries receive revenues in local currencies  and in part because the expenses of our customer service center are paid in canadian dollars 
our european subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currencies  which in part offsets our foreign currency risk related to european revenues received in local currencies 
our european subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
because the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation  as exchange rates vary  such financial results may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our operating results and our net income loss
