table of contents risk factors risk factors related to our business because of our dependence on certain customers  the loss of a top customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
during  we derived of our revenues from five customers 
these five customers were nokia  nortel  ibm  comverse and diebold 
during  revenues attributable to nokia and nortel were and  respectively 
we believe that sales to these customers will continue to be a substantial percentage of our revenues 
a financial hardship experienced by  or a substantial decrease in sales to any one of our top customers could materially affect revenues and profitability 
we derive a majority of our revenue from design wins 
not all design wins actually ramp into production  and if ramped into production the volumes derived from such design wins may not be as significant as we had originally estimated  which could have a substantial negative impact on our anticipated revenues and profitability 
we derive a majority of our revenues from design wins 
we announced design wins during and design wins during a design win is a project estimated at the time of the design win to produce more than  in revenue per year assuming full production 
design wins that ramp into production do so at varying rates 
if a design win actually ramps into production  the average ramp into production begins about months after the win  although some more complex wins can take up to months or longer 
after that  there is an additional time lag from the start of production ramp to peak revenue 
not all design wins ramp into production and even if a win is ramped into production  the volumes derived from such design win may not be as significant as we had originally estimated 
the determination of a design win is highly subjective and is based on information available to us at the time of the project estimate 
design wins are sometimes canceled or delayed  or can perform below original expectations  which can adversely impact anticipated revenues and profitability 
due to the confidential nature of the relationships we maintain with our customers  as a general practice  we do not update design win information for actual results 
our business depends on the service provider systems  enterprise systems and commercial systems markets in which demand can be cyclical  and any inability to sell products to these markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
we derive our revenues from a number of diverse end markets  some of which are subject to significant cyclical changes in demand 
in  we derived  and of our revenues from the service provider systems market  the commercial systems market and the enterprise systems market  respectively 
we believe that our revenues will continue to be divided among these three markets 
service provider revenues include  but are not limited to  telecommunications sales to comverse  lucent  nokia and nortel 
enterprise systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to avaya  inc  ibm and nortel 
commercial systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to agilent technologies  beckman coulter inc  diebold  philips medical systems ned b 
v and seimens ag 
generally  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if our customers experience adverse economic conditions in the markets into which they sell our products end markets  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by our customers 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  economic uncertainty and structural financial problems 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in customer demand in these end markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
significant reduction in our customers spending  such as what we experienced in and  will result in decreased revenues and earnings 
we continue to execute on our strategy of expanding into new end markets either through new design wins with our existing customers or through new customer relationships  but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful 

table of contents because of our dependence on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for some of the components we use in the manufacture of our products  a loss of a supplier or a shortage of any of these components could have a material adverse effect on our business or our financial performance 
we depend on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for a continuing supply of the components we use in the manufacture of our products and any disruption in supply could adversely impact our financial performance 
for example  we are dependent solely on intel for the supply of some microprocessors and other components  and we depend on epson electronic america  lucent technologies  inc  maxim integrated products  inc  texas instruments  inc  and toshiba america inc 
as the sole source suppliers for other components 
alternative sources of supply for some of these components would be difficult to locate 
because we depend on two primary contract manufacturing partners  any failed or less than optimal execution on their behalf could temporarily affect our revenues and profitability 
although  we utilize several contract manufacturers for outsourced board and system production  we depend on two primary contract manufacturing partners  manufacturers services limited and sanmina sci  and any failed or less than optimal execution on their behalf could temporarily affect our revenues and profitability 
in addition  our outsourced board and system production could either be moved internally or transferred to other contract manufacturers 
such transfers would require technical and logistical activities and would not be instantaneous 
at the end of  our two primary contract manufacturing partners were manufacturing approximately half of all radisys unit volume 
competition in the market for embedded systems is intense  and if we lose our position  our revenues and profitability could decline 
we compete with a number of companies providing embedded systems  including advantech co 
ltd  force computers  a division of solectron  inc  divisions within intel corporation  kontron ag  motorola computer group  a unit of motorola inc  performance technologies and sbs technologies 
because the embedded systems market is growing  it is attracting new non traditional competitors 
these non traditonal competitors include contract manufacturers that provide design services  asia based original design manufacturers odm  and providers of traditional it infrastructure products 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including a longer operating history  greater name recognition and marketing power  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
furthermore  existing or potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
as a result of increased competition  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  many of the industries we serve  such as the communications industry  are encountering market consolidation  or are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in increased pricing pressure and additional competition 
potential acquisitions and partnerships may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our company stock 
future acquisitions and partnerships may involve the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity linked securities  issuance of debt and amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives 
moreover  to the extent that any proposed acquisition or strategic investment is not 
table of contents favorably received by shareholders  analysts and others in the investment community  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event that an acquisition or a partnership does occur and we are unable to successfully integrate operations  technologies  products or personnel that we acquire  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our international operations expose us to additional political  economic and regulatory risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the united states 
we derived of our revenues from emea and from asia pacific 
in addition  we have a design center located in birmingham  united kingdom 
as a result  we are subject to worldwide economic and market conditions risks generally associated with global trade  such as fluctuating exchange rates  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic conditions 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we are unable to generate sufficient income in the future  we may not be able to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets or support our current levels of goodwill and intangibles on our balance sheet 
we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  we may not generate sufficient taxable income due to losses from operations and events related to restructurings and acquisitions 
accordingly  we may record a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of taxable future income are not achieved 
on the other hand  if we generate taxable income in excess of our expectations  the valuation allowance may be reduced accordingly 
we also cannot provide absolute assurance that future income will support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and therefore  we may incur an impairment charge in the future 
because we have material levels of customer specific inventory  a financial hardship experienced by our customers could have a material adverse impact on our profitability 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
a financial hardship experienced by our customers could materially affect the viability of the dedicated inventory  and ultimately adversely impact our profitability 
our products for embedded computing applications are based on industry standards  which are continually evolving  and any failure to conform to these standards could have a substantial negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
we develop and supply a mix of perfect fit and off the shelf products 
off the shelf products for embedded computing applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success in these products will depend  in part  upon our capacity to invest in  and successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards 
our inability to invest in or conform to these standards could render parts of our product portfolio uncompetitive  unmarketable or obsolete 
as our addressable markets develop new standards  we may be unable to successfully invest in  design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or achieve substantial market acceptance

the decrease in revenues from to was principally attributable to lower customer sales as a result of the overall poor economic conditions and the related downturn within our three primary markets service provider systems  commercial systems and enterprise systems 
we believe the increase in revenues from to reflect our improving position in a number of diverse and improving end markets and new product introductions from design wins ramping into production 
while we remain cautious about the economic environment  indications existed of an improving economic outlook as we exited fiscal we continue to achieve new design wins 
we announced design wins during and design wins during we derive a majority of our revenues from design wins 
a design win is a project estimated at the time of the design win to produce more than  in revenue per year assuming full production 
if a design win actually ramps into production  the average ramp into production begins about months after the win  although some more complex wins can take up to months or longer 
not all design wins ramp into production and even if a win is ramped into production  the volumes derived from such design win may not be as significant as we had originally estimated

in light of overall market conditions and the economic downturn during  we initiated several cost reduction measures 
beginning in the first quarter of  we initiated a restructuring of our operations 
as a result  we recorded several restructuring charges in  and these measures  which included workforce reductions  consolidation of certain facilities  fixed asset and capitalized software write downs  and other costs  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated demands for our products 
we realized the effect of reduced costs associated with these restructuring events in and  however  we do not anticipate these restructuring events to reduce costs in in addition to the restructuring of our operations  we began an aggressive strategic plan to reduce material costs  which began to materialize in the latter half of and in we also instituted cost cutting measures during and  including office closures and tighter controls on discretionary spending 
these general cost cutting measures have resulted in higher margins and lower operating expenses than in previous years 
during we completed the sale of our multibus business unit and during we completed the sale of our savvi business  both of which were intended to allow us to focus on our core embedded systems business within our three primary markets 
in we will incur stock based compensation expense related to certain shares that will be issued pursuant to the terms of our employee stock purchase plan espp 
the expense per share will be calculated as the difference between and 
additionally  the expense is dependent on the number of espp shares that are actually purchased by certain espp participants 
the number of shares actually purchased is dependent upon total contributions by those espp participants 
we currently estimate that approximately thousand shares will be subject to inclusion in this calculation for each of the purchase periods ending may  and august  based on the estimate of the number of shares subject to inclusion in this calculation  we currently estimate the related stock compensation expense to be approximately thousand  thousand  and thousand for the first  second and third quarters of  respectively

in and  we repurchased million of the convertible subordinated notes for million
