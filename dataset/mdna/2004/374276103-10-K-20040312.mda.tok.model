form k part i item customers we serve a variety of customers in four major categories creative customers advertising and design agencies  editorial customers publishing and media companies  corporate customers in house advertising groups and corporate communications departments and film customers film and broadcast production companies 
due to the wide variety of customers and channels to and through which our products and services are marketed  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas  we are not dependent on a single customer or a few customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on us 
creative customers for our creative customers  we supply images that cover a wide variety of contemporary subjects including lifestyles  business  science  health and beauty  sports  transportation and travel 
these customers usually have a commercial or advertising message they are trying to convey and  consequently  are typically looking for a specific conceptual image 
image relevance and accessibility are important factors in the customer s decision 
advertising and design agency customers need to access imagery as part of their everyday working life 
editorial customers we supply images to a customer base of professionals who use imagery in the publication of newspapers  books and magazines  both online and in traditional media 
the imagery that is provided to these customers covers major political  news  social and sporting events ranging from contemporary photographs to imagery from the beginning of photography in the early nineteenth century

direct communication with our customers  however  remains a significant component of our sales strategy 
our sales representatives assist customers in finding the images they need and keep them informed about our newly offered products and services 
product rights we maintain control of our products at all times 
customers may license rights to use single images  film clips or cd rom products containing multiple images 
certain types of images may be licensed on an exclusive basis for an additional fee 
customers may also license rights to our editorial images on a subscription basis 
ownership of imagery does not pass to customers who license the imagery  however  occasionally our customers will purchase imagery outright 
licensing methods we group our image collections into three primary portfolios corresponding to our three main licensing methods rights managed  including still and moving contemporary and archival imagery  royalty free  including still and moving imagery  and subscriptions  encompassing selected editorial imagery only customers may also license editorial images on an individual basis 
for rights managed licensing  the license fee is based on how the image will be used  including geographical distribution  license duration  media  exclusivity and circulation 
for example  an image to be used as an eighth of a page photo in a brochure to be distributed in one city for three months will cost less to license than an image to be used in a global advertising campaign for a year that 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part i item includes print advertising  billboards and point of purchase displays 
for an additional fee  customers may also license exclusive rights to an image in a particular geography or industry for a prescribed period of time 
we recently introduced flexible license packs  which offer customers a quick and cost effective way to license an image for multiple preset media without having to enter into individual license agreements 
for royalty free licensing  the license fee is based on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution generally one megabyte to high resolution generally megabytes 
once the customer has licensed the image  that customer may use the image multiple times for multiple projects without paying additional fees 
royalty free images may be licensed on a single image basis or as part of a collection of images on a cd rom 
subscription licensing is available only for selected editorial images 
under this licensing method  customers pay a periodic fee and then may download as many of the selected editorial images as they need during the subscription period 
operations and technology we employ a centralized and integrated technology platform as the foundation for our gettyimages 
com website as well as our back office systems 
this platform enables customers to search  select  license and download our digital content including photographs  film clips and illustrations from one location  gettyimages 
com 
it also enables centralized sales order processing  customer database management  finance and accounting systems 
these systems span multiple operational activities  including customer interaction  transaction processing  order fulfillment and invoicing 
in  we improved our website offerings in several ways 
we implemented a number of enhancements to our royalty free collections  including additional price point categories  larger digital file sizes and a number of new imagery collections 
we also launched our new film offering  which provides online access to our core film collection in digital format and enables customers to search  select  license and download film clips via the internet 
we enhanced our rights managed licensing process and our product merchandising functionality 
in addition  we introduced virtual cd roms that allow customers online access to groups of royalty free images for one fee 
we upgraded the user interface for the editorial section of our website adding new search and browse functionality  providing easier access to our full range of editorial imagery  including news  sport  entertainment  features  archival and publicity product offerings 
we also added local currency pricing for a number of new international markets  including australia  hong kong  malaysia  new zealand  singapore  thailand and the philippines

these systems were designed to provide reliable e commerce connectivity and responsive online customer interaction 
our systems infrastructure is hosted internally as well as at an external hosting provider 
both internal and external hosting centers provide hour monitoring  power generators and limited back up systems 
competition the market for visual content and related products and services is highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors are name recognition  company reputation  the quality  relevance  timeliness and diversity of the images in a company s collections  the quality of contributing photographers and cinematographers under contract with a company  effective use of current and emerging technology  customer service  pricing  accessibility of imagery  distribution capability and speed of fulfillment 
our current and potential competitors include other general visual content providers such as corbis  creatas  photonica  superstock and zefa

there are also hundreds of small stock photography and film footage agencies and image content aggregators throughout the world 
intellectual property most of the images in our collections are obtained from independent photographers and cinematographers on an exclusive basis 
professional photographers and cinematographers prefer to retain ownership of their work 
as a result  copyright to an image remains with the contributing photographer or cinematographer in most cases  while we obtain the exclusive right to market the image on their behalf for a period of time

because of these risks and others  it is possible that our future quarterly results may differ from management s expectations and the expectations of analysts and investors  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
other imagery partners are important to our business we have entered into commercial agreements with other businesses to host and license their imagery on the gettyimages 
com website 
these arrangements require resource and personnel commitments by us  limiting the number of images from other imagery partners we may host or integrate during a given period

general background we are a leading provider of high quality  relevant imagery and related services to creative professionals at advertising agencies  graphic design firms  corporations  and film and broadcasting companies  press and editorial customers involved in newspaper  magazine  book  cd rom and online publishing  and corporate communications departments and other business customers 
revenue we generate our revenue from licensing rights to use imagery and from providing related services 
revenue is principally derived from a large number of relatively small transactions involving licensing rights to use single still non moving images  film clips or cd rom products containing multiple images 
we also generate revenue from subscription or bulk purchase agreements under which customers are provided access to imagery online 
still imagery the majority of the still imagery that we license is broken down into three portfolios rights managed  royalty free  and editorial 
rights managed images are licensed by customers on a use by use basis and generally have higher license fees based on the intended use of the image  including type of media  geographical distribution  license duration  circulation and level of exclusivity 
royalty free images are licensed by customers on a nonexclusive basis and can be used for multiple projects over an unlimited time period 
license fees for royalty free cd rom products are generally the same for each licensee  while license fees for single royalty free images differ depending on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution generally one megabyte to high resolution generally megabytes 
editorial imagery consists of news  sports  entertainment and archival imagery  and is licensed on a single image or subscription basis 
film we also maintain a portfolio of film  or moving imagery  which we license on a rights managed or royalty free basis 
license fees for rights managed and royalty free film are based on the same factors as license fees for the respective still imagery 
cost of sales our cost of sales on images licensed to our customers primarily consists of commission payments to contributors  comprised of photographers  cinematographers and other imagery partners 
these contributors are under contract with us and typically receive payments of up to of the revenue  depending on the portfolio as discussed above and where the imagery is licensed licenses outside a contributor s home territory result in lower commissions 
we own a significant number of the images in our collections  and these images do not require commission payments 
our imagery is also licensed through distributors worldwide 
licenses through distributors comprised approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in both and distributors typically earn and retain to of the license fee  and we recognize the remaining to as revenue 
commissions paid to contributors on distributor revenue are of the total license fee 
this results in an average gross margin of approximately to on distributor revenue

we estimate the implied fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that involves significant assumptions and estimates based on management s best judgments of current and future circumstances  including currently enacted tax laws  our future weighted average cost of capital  and our future financial performance 
as circumstances change  it is reasonably possible that future goodwill impairment tests could result in a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
at august   our annual valuation date  the implied fair value of our goodwill exceeded its carrying value by billion  causing management to believe that impairment is unlikely in the near future 
the balance of goodwill at december  was million 
identifiable intangible assets are assets that do not have physical representation  but that arise from contractual or other legal rights or are capable of being separated or divided from us and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
the majority of the million net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of customer lists million and trademarks  trade names and copyrights million 
identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows that management estimates will be generated by the assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives see estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets below for more information 
estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets the estimated useful lives of our most significant property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are discussed below 
should we determine at some point in the future that the useful lives of these assets are shorter than estimated  it is reasonably possible that we would be required to accelerate the amortization  or write off the impaired portion  of the unamortized balance of these assets 
property and equipment the majority of the million net book value of our property and equipment at december  consisted of image content million  hardware and software million and leasehold improvements million 
the estimated useful lives of image content are determined based on the average life of imagery that is currently generating revenue 
periodically  we perform analyses of populations of imagery that are representative of all of our image collections 
these analyses have shown that the average life of contemporary imagery approximates four years and that the average life of archival imagery approximates years 
historical revenue may not be indicative of future revenue  and therefore  these estimated useful lives are inherently uncertain and require management s most difficult judgments 
the three year estimated useful life of hardware and software is determined based on prior experience with related technology and the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans 
as hardware and software providers future support of today s technology and the future of technology in general are inherently uncertain  these estimated useful lives require management s most difficult judgments 
these lives are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as significant technological developments  or the failure of a vendor to continue to support a particular version of software 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  ranging from two to years  with the majority of the net book value invested in assets with original estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
the estimated useful lives of improvements are determined based on our prior experience with similar assets and the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans 
our future operating plans could change and we may choose to  or be required to  terminate our leases and thereby abandon our leasehold improvements prior to the termination of the lease or the end of the otherwise estimated useful life 
as such  these estimated useful lives require management s most difficult judgments 
these lives are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as a planned move to or from  or remodeling of  a leased space

form k part ii item identifiable intangible assets as discussed above  the majority of the net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of customer lists and trademarks  trade names and copyrights 
we are required to evaluate the remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revisions to the remaining periods of amortization 
no revisions were determined to be necessary during any future revisions would be applied prospectively 
the estimated useful lives of customer lists  ranging from five to seven years  are determined based on our prior experience with customers in general and revenue we expect to generate through these specific customers in the future 
as customers are free to terminate their relationship with us at any time  as our past experience with one group of customers may not be indicative of our future experience with another group  and as past revenue may not be indicative of future revenue  the estimation of these useful lives requires management s most difficult judgments 
the estimated useful lives of trademarks  trade names and copyrights  ranging from two to years  are generally based on contractual or other legal terms 
as these assets useful lives may terminate prior to their contractual life due to changes in operating plans  brand strategy  acquisition or disposition of businesses  and legal action  among other circumstances  the estimation of these useful lives requires management s most difficult judgments 
income taxes we analyze our tax positions and record estimates in our consolidated balance sheets for potential tax liabilities that may arise in the future relating to current and prior tax periods 
these estimates require management s most difficult judgments as they are based on interpretations of tax laws 
these balances are reviewed periodically  and to the extent that future liabilities differ from management s estimates  it is reasonably possible that we would be required to increase or decrease our estimates of these liabilities through an entry to income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income taxes  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and of tax loss carryforwards  are based on currently enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified into net current and net non current amounts  based on the balance sheet classification of the related asset or liability 
deferred us income taxes are not provided for unremitted foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we expect those earnings will be permanently reinvested 
in the fourth quarter of  we updated our estimated future taxable income for our us operations and determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize more of the deferred tax asset than the net balance at that date 
therefore  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  with million related to net operating losses reversed through a credit to income tax expense and million related to employee stock option exercises reversed through a credit to additional paid in capital 
we retained approximately million of the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets generated from capital loss carryforwards and foreign net operating losses that we may not fully recover 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the deferred tax assets in respect of loss carryforwards and the related loss carryforwards at december  expire as follows deferred taxes net operating loss carryforwards in thousands between and domestic between and foreign indefinite foreign totals the remaining million in deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences between book and tax income and  to the extent that they are not absorbed by future taxable income  they will increase future net operating losses 
although realization is not assured  management believes  based on its current estimates of near term future taxable income for its us operations and tax planning 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item strategies  that it is more likely than not that the domestic net deferred tax assets will be realized within a reasonable period of time and substantially prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards between and in the event that actual results differ from management s current expectations  the valuation allowance could materially change  directly impacting our consolidated financial statements 
we will reevaluate the valuation allowance each year upon completion of updated estimates of taxable income for future periods 
if the estimates indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset balance  a greater valuation allowance will be recorded and charged to income tax expense in the period of that determination  which could be in advance of the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
foreign exchange foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from changes in the exchange rates underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  other than long term intercompany balances  are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the exchange rates change 
foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from changes in the exchange rates underlying intercompany balances that are of a long term investment nature  for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
the classification of these balances as long term is one of management s most difficult judgments as the future cash needs of the parent company and each subsidiary are uncertain 
should we reclassify and settle a portion of these intercompany balances at some time in the future due to domestic cash needs or for other purposes  these intercompany balances would be redesignated as short term  and all future revaluation gains and losses would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  should we dispose of one of the subsidiaries with which we have a long term intercompany balance  the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss associated with that entity would be included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the disposal of the subsidiary 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for disclosure of significant long term intercompany balances 
foreign exchange gains of million and million and losses of million for the years ended december   and  respectively  arose from changes in the exchange rates underlying intercompany balances deemed to be long term in nature and therefore were excluded from our consolidated statements of operations and included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses as a percentage of revenue  existing economic conditions  and specific account analysis of at risk customers and distributors 
historical losses and existing economic conditions may not necessarily be indicative of future losses  and the impact of economic conditions on each of our customers is difficult to estimate  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management s most difficult judgments 
should future uncollectible amounts not reflect management s current estimates  it is reasonably possible that we would be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or write off specific uncollectible balances through bad debt expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the percentage of our investment in trade receivables  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  more than days old as of december  and was and  respectively 
catalogs as described in part iv  item a  note to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  effective october   the costs of producing image marketing catalogs are expensed upon initial distribution of each catalog rather than deferred and amortized 
this change was required because our financial information systems implemented at that time no longer permit us to directly associate image revenue with specific catalogs 
in addition  over the past two years  we have shifted our marketing strategy from an emphasis on printed catalogs to a focus on e mail marketing and new forms of interactive communications 
we believe these forms are more cost effective than printed catalogs  provide more opportunities for targeted marketing and better meet our customers needs

none of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
we acquired these two companies to expand our editorial offerings in order to meet growing consumer and media demand for this type of imagery 
the main factor that contributed to purchase prices in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired is our ability to grow the revenue of these businesses more significantly than an average market participant through our gettyimages

results of operations executive overview we achieved our primary objective for  revenue growth  as demonstrated by the increase in our revenue year over year 
this objective was achieved despite challenging market conditions most of the year and was due mainly to continued strength of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  price increases  successful revitalization of our royalty free imagery portfolio and expansion of our partnerships with other imagery providers 
revenue growth in was achieved while maintaining lowered levels of selling  general and administrative expenses  resulting in a significant increase in operating income and operating margin the percentage derived by dividing income from operations by revenue 
for  our primary objective is again to grow revenue  primarily through increased focus on a sales and marketing approach targeted to the specific product and pricing needs of various customer groups 
in particular  we will strive to increase our penetration into the editorial market  the japanese market  and markets for new revenue streams  such as assignment photography 
in addition to these initiatives  we expect revenue for to benefit from a recovery in the market for visual content 
this market is very difficult to measure  however  based on information received from our customers  we believe that the market began to recover in the fourth quarter of we plan to grow revenue in without increasing selling  general and administrative expenses proportionately  thus increasing operating margin 
risks specific to achieving our goals for include a reversal of the market recovery trend we experienced in the fourth quarter of  failure to increase our penetration into the editorial market  failure of the japanese market to transition to licensing imagery over the internet or to a new imagery provider  and failure to successfully market  or respond to demand for  assignment photography

guarantees we indemnify certain customers from claims related to alleged infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties  such as claims arising from a photographer s failure to secure model and property releases for an image we license 
the standard terms of these guarantees require us to defend those claims and pay related damages  if any 
we mitigate this risk by contractually requiring our contributing photographers and other imagery partners to secure all necessary model and property releases prior to submitting any imagery to us  and by requiring them to indemnify us in the event a claim arises in relation to an image they have provided 
other imagery partners are also required to carry insurance policies for losses related to such claims 
we do not record any liabilities for these guarantees until claims are made and we are able to assess the range of possible payments and available recourse from our imagery partners 
historically  our exposure to such claims has been immaterial  as were our recorded liabilities for intellectual property infringement at december  and in the ordinary course of business  we also enter into certain types of agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers other than those licensing images  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  agreements with distributors  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their distribution of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with directors and officers  under which we indemnify them to the full extent allowed by delaware law against claims relating to their service to us  agreements with purchasers of businesses we have sold  under which we may indemnify the purchasers against claims arising from our operation of the businesses prior to sale  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct our business primarily in the us and europe  with transactions and cash flows denominated primarily in us dollars  euros and british pounds

all of our foreign currency exchange rates are provided by bloomberg llc

some of these transactions result in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  for

form k part ii item a which the amount of cash to be received or paid in the future remains fixed in the foreign currency but changes from month to month in the entity s functional currency as the exchange rate between the foreign currency and the functional currency fluctuates 
the changes in the amount of functional currency to be received or paid are transaction gains and losses  which are  with the exception of those related to long term intercompany balances see below  reported in exchange gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
transaction gains and losses arising from assets and liabilities denominated in the same foreign currencies may offset each other  in part  through what we refer to as natural hedging 
for example  if a us dollar functional currency entity holds both a receivable and a payable denominated in euros  and the us dollar weakens against the euro  the entity will experience a gain on its receivable and a loss on its payable 
where our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not naturally hedged  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the impact of transaction gains and losses 
our forward contracts generally range from one to three months in original maturity  are held by our us and us functional currency companies  and require the sale of british pounds and euros and the purchase of functional currencies 
these forward contracts are economic hedges of our exposures but have not been designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes 
gains and losses resulting from the fluctuation in the exchange rates underlying these forward contracts are recorded in exchange gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
we recognized net transaction gains of million and million and losses of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  other than long term intercompany balances discussed below  which are subject to transaction gains and losses each month  were outstanding at december   and were in excess of million individually are summarized below by the functional currency of the operation or subsidiary where the balances are recorded 
changes in balances since december  are principally due to revenue  cash settlements  foreign currency revaluation  and forward foreign exchange contract activity

form k part ii item a foreign currency denominated intercompany balances that are of a long term investment nature are also subject to transaction gains and losses each month  as the amount of functional currency that would be received or paid on settlement fluctuates each month as the underlying exchange rates change 
however  because settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  these transaction gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as translation adjustments see discussion below 
foreign exchange gains of million and million and losses of million for the years ended december   and  respectively  arose from the revaluation of such balances 
foreign currency denominated long term intercompany balances outstanding at december  and in excess of million individually are summarized below by the functional currency of the books where the balances are recorded

accumulated translation adjustments will remain in our consolidated balance sheets until such time as we sell or otherwise dispose of a foreign subsidiary  if ever 
the accumulated translation adjustment associated with such a subsidiary would be included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the disposal of the subsidiary
