use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the critical accounting policies and most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  insurance reserves  recoverability of accounts receivable  restructuring reserves  valuation allowances and pension and other post retirement benefits expense 
actual amounts could differ significantly from the estimates 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the operation of full service restaurants  the distribution and sale of premium ice cream desserts through retail and institutional locations and franchising 
the company recognizes restaurant revenue upon receipt of payment from the customer and retail revenue  net of discounts and allowances  upon delivery of product 
reserves for discounts and allowances from retail sales are estimated and accrued when revenue is recorded based on promotional planners prepared by the company s retail sales force 
actual amounts could differ materially from the estimates 
franchise royalty income  based on net sales of franchisees  is payable monthly and is recorded on the accrual method 
franchise fees are recorded as revenue upon completion of all significant services  generally upon opening of the restaurant

the company s liabilities for estimated ultimate losses for workers compensation  automobile  general liability  employer s liability and product liability are actuarially determined and recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis 
the projections of estimated ultimate losses are based on commonly used actuarial procedures 
these procedures take into consideration certain actuarial assumptions or management judgments regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim settlement practices 
while the estimated ultimate losses are reasonable  any actuarial estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the volatility inherent in casualty exposures and changes in the assumptions 
the company s provision for insurance expense reflects estimated amounts for the current year as well as revisions in estimates to prior years
