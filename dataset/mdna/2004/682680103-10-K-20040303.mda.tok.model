regulated businesses kgs uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect kgs customers from upward volatility in natural gas market prices 
at december   kgs had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of purchases for bcf of gas  representing part of kgs gas purchase requirements for the winter heating months based on normal weather conditions 
gains or losses associated with the kgs hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly pga 
from time to time  tgs uses derivative instruments to mitigate the volatility of the cost of gas to protect its customers in the city of el paso 
at december   tgs had no derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of purchases of gas 
gains or losses associated with the derivative instruments would be included in and recoverable through the monthly purchased gas adjustment 
value at risk we measure market risk in the trading  price risk management  and non trading portfolios of our non regulated businesses using a value at risk var methodology  which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval 
our var calculations are based on the monte carlo approach  which we began using in the second quarter of prior to that time  we used the variance covariance approach 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance  to determine risk targets and set position limits 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
inputs to the calculation include prices  positions  instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix 
historical data is used to estimate our var with more weight given to recent data  which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements 
we rely on var to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
while management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable  no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating var 
different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
our var exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses trading  price risk management  and non trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements 
a one day time horizon and a percent confidence level were used in our var data 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the var calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in our derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and gas in storage 
var information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodology s other limitations 

table of contents the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by the var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table details the average  high and low var calculations 
years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low the variations in the var data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolio during the year 
risk policy and oversight we control the scope of risk management  marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management 
our board of directors affirms the risk limit parameters  with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies 
a risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  oversees all activities related to commodity price  credit and interest rate risk management  and marketing and trading activities 
the committee also proposes risk metrics including var and position loss limits 
we have a corporate risk control organization led by our senior vice president of financial services and the vice president of audit services and risk control  who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits as well as evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions 
key risk control activities include credit review and approval  credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring  validation of transactions  portfolio valuation  var and other risk metrics 
to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business  operating results or financial position 
interest rate risk we are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on percent of our debt was fixed  after considering the effect of interest rate swaps 
currently  million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating 
the floating rate debt is based on both three and six month london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   million of the million had the interest rate locked through the first quarter of based on the current libor strip and the locks in place  the weighted average rate on the million of debt will be reduced from percent to percent 
this will result in an estimated savings of million during the swaps resulted in approximately million in savings in and million in savings during at december   price risk management assets include million to recognize the fair value of our derivatives that are designated as fair value hedging instruments 
long term debt includes approximately million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability 
interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended december   to recognize the ineffectiveness of these hedges 
at december   a basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this amount is limited based on the libor locks that we have in place through the first quarter of if these locks were not in place  a basis point change in the interest rates would affect our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
if interest rates changed significantly  we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change 
since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain  no change has been assumed
