historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview and introduction the company is a leading united states provider of end to end human capital management solutions 
the company offers its clients  which are typically small to medium sized businesses with between and employees  a broad range of tools and services that provide a complete solution for the clients human resource outsourcing needs 
the company s tools and services include assisting clients with finding the right employees  developing and managing the clients employees  retaining top quality employees  managing the clients paperwork  including benefits administration  payroll administration  governmental compliance  risk management  unemployment administration  and health  welfare and retirement benefits and protecting the clients business 
the company delivers its tools and services to its clients through an integrated and proactive client relationship management system 
each client is assigned a dedicated human resource consultant who is located at either a local company branch office nearby the clients location or at the company s centralized field support service center located in bradenton  florida 
in addition  the client has x access to its human resource information via the company s internal portal  gevity central  as well as access to specialized human resource consultants in areas including k administration  unemployment service administration  etc 
the company believes that the human resource outsourcing market focusing on small and medium sized businesses  as measured by the number of employees per client  is by far its most attractive market in terms of customer concentration  need for customized solutions  price sensitivity  capital investment  new client acquisition cost  sales cycle and market growth 
the company believes that the human resource outsourcing competitive landscape is highly fragmented and populated by various point solution providers who offer segments of the entire service offering that the company provides to its clients 
the company focuses on the professional service fees that it earns from its clients as the primary source of its net income and cash flow 
by delivering its human resource outsourcing solutions to its clients through a co employment relationship  the company is also responsible for providing workers compensation and unemployment insurance benefits to its client s employees as well as health and welfare benefits 
in so doing  the company has an opportunity to generate net income and cash but does not believe that this can be a significant portion of its overall business profitability 
in addition to the significant human resource outsourcing opportunity that exists in the underserved small to medium sized business market  the company believes that there also exists a significant pricing opportunity in delivering its human resource outsourcing services from the current level of professional service fees being charged by the company 
the company believes that the primary challenge and risk it faces in delivering its human resource outsourcing solutions is its ability to convert small to medium sized business to accept the concept of human resource outsourcing 
the company believes that most small to medium sized businesses outsource certain aspects of the company s total solution  including payroll administration  health and welfare administration and providing workers compensation insurance  but that only a small number of businesses outsource the entire offering that the company provides 
the company has transitioned its business from one that provided discounted insurance products to its clients to one that delivers human resource outsourcing solutions for its clients 
during such transition  the total number of client employees serviced by the company declined from over  client employees to under  client employees 
during the transition  the company increased its profitability by focusing on increased profitability per client employee 
the company continues to focus on increasing the profitability of each client employee as well as on increasing the overall number of client employees serviced 
the company believes that it can increase the overall number of client employees serviced through the hiring of additional sales personnel that will result in a larger amount of new client employees acquired  through improved human resource outsourcing service offerings that will lead to higher current client employee retention levels and through acquisitions of other human resource outsourcing client portfolios 
the following table provides information that the company utilizes when assessing the financial performance of its business  which includes the effect of the teamstaff acquisition in november for the years ended december  december  change statistical data average number of client employees paid by month   
average wage per average client employees paid by month   
professional service fees per average number of client employees paid by month  
gross profit per average number of client employees paid by month  
operating income per average number of client employees paid by month 
the average number of client employees paid by month is calculated based upon the sum of the number of paid client employees at the end of each month in the year divided by months 
all other statistical information above is based upon actual year to date amounts divided by the average number of client employees paid by month 
the company believes that the primary risks in being able to increase the overall number of client employees serviced are the amount of time required for the additional sales personnel to begin to acquire new client employees that may be longer than anticipated  the current client employee retention levels may decrease if clients decide to source their human resource outsourcing needs from alternative service providers  other human resource outsourcing client employee portfolios may not be available for acquisition due to price or quality of the portfolios  and that the company cannot continue to provide insurance related products of a quality to acquire new client employees and to retain current client employees 
revenues the gross billings that the company charges its clients under its professional services agreement include each client employee s gross wages  a professional service fee and  to the extent elected by the clients  health and welfare benefit plan costs 
the company s professional service fee  which is primarily computed on a per employee basis  is intended to yield a profit to the company and to cover the costs of the human resource outsourcing services provided by the company to the client  certain employment related taxes and workers compensation insurance coverage 
the component of the professional service fee related to human resource outsourcing varies according to the size and the location of the client 
the component of the professional service fee related to workers compensation and unemployment insurance is based  in part  on the client s historical claims experience 
all charges by the company are invoiced along with each periodic payroll provided to the client 
the company accounts for its revenues using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  the company recognizes its revenues in the period in which the client employee performs work 
the company accrues revenues and unbilled receivables for professional service fees relating to work performed by client employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
in addition  the related costs of services are accrued as a liability for the same period 
subsequent to the end of each period  such wages are paid and the related service fees are billed 
the company reports revenues from professional service fees in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company reports as revenues  on a gross basis  the total amount billed to clients for professional service fees  health and welfare benefit plan fees  workers compensation and unemployment insurance fees 
the company reports revenues on a gross basis for these fees because the company is the primary obligor and deemed to be the principal in these transactions under eitf no 
the company reports revenues on a net basis for the amount billed to clients for client employee salaries  wages and certain payroll related taxes less amounts paid to client employees and taxing authorities for these salaries  wages and taxes 
historically the company reported the full amount of its gross billings  including the portion that represents the gross wages of its client employees  as revenue 
the company changed from gross revenue reporting to net revenue reporting for client employee salaries  wages and certain payroll taxes during the fourth quarter of based on the criteria established by eitf no 
 the company determined that the change better recognized the substance of the transactions between the company and its clients 
in addition  the change would better focus the company on  and allow investors to better understand  the financial results of the company s core business 
the change to a more preferable accounting method resulted in no effect on net income or earnings per share 
because of the significance of the reclassification of revenue and expense components to the income statement  the company previously reflected the change as if it had occurred on january  in its annual report on form k for the year ended december  the company s revenues are impacted by the number of client employees it serves  the number of client employees paid each period and the related wages paid  and the number of client employees participating in the company s benefit plans 
because a portion of the professional service fee charged is computed as a percentage of gross payroll  revenues are affected by fluctuations in the gross payroll caused by the composition of the employee base  inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies in the company s markets 
cost of services cost of services includes health and welfare benefit plan costs  workers compensation insurance costs and state unemployment tax costs  as well as other direct costs associated with the company s revenue generating activities 
health and welfare benefit plan costs are comprised primarily of medical benefit costs  but also include costs of other employee benefits such as dental  vision  disability and group life insurance 
benefit claims incurred by client employees under the benefit plans are expensed as incurred according to the terms of each contract 
in addition  for certain contracts  liability reserves are established for benefit claims reported and not yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
in certain instances  the company decides to make a contribution toward the medical benefit plan costs of certain clients 
the contribution is referred to as a health benefit subsidy 
the addition of the client employees of these clients as participants in the company s medical benefit plans helps to stabilize the overall claims experience risk associated with those plans 
an aggregate health benefit subsidy in excess of a planned amount may occur when the medical cost inflation exceeds expected medical cost trends or when medical benefit plan enrollment of those who qualify for a subsidy exceeds expectations 
conversely  a health benefit surplus may occur when the medical cost inflation is less than expected medical cost trends or when medical benefit plan enrollment of those who qualify for a subsidy is less than expectations 
the company offers its medical benefit plans through partnerships with premier health care companies

these companies have extensive provider networks and strong reputations in the markets in which the company operates 
substantially all of the company s client employees are covered under the company s workers compensation program with aig beginning in workers compensation costs for the year are based on premiums paid to aig for the current year coverage  estimated total costs of claims to be paid by the company that fall within the policy deductible  the administrative costs of the program  the return on investment premium dollars paid as part of the program and the discount rate used in determining the present value of future payments to be made under the program 
additionally  any revisions to the estimates of the prior year loss sensitive programs are recognized in the current year 
in states where private insurance is not permitted  client employees are covered by state insurance funds 
premiums paid to state insurance funds are expensed as incurred 
on an annual basis  the company reviews the current and prior year claims information with its independent actuaries 
the current accrual rate and overall workers compensation reserves may be adjusted based on current and historical loss trends  fluctuations in the administrative costs associated with the program  actual returns on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid and changes in the discount rate used to determine the present value of future payments to be made under the program 
the final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close  by the final administrative costs of the program and by the final return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid 
see business workers compensation plans 
state unemployment taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll costs and expensed as incurred 
rates vary from state to state and are based upon the employer s claims history 
the company aggressively manages its state unemployment tax exposure by contesting unwarranted claims 
operating expenses operating expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages and commissions associated with the company s internal employees  and general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing commissions and client referral fees are expensed as incurred 
the company expects that future revenue growth will result in increased operating leverage as the company s fixed operating expenses are leveraged over a larger revenue base 
income taxes the company records income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
the company s effective tax rates for and were and respectively 
such effective tax rates differed from the statutory federal tax rates primarily because of state taxes and federal tax credits 
profitability profitability is largely dependent upon the company s success in generating professional fees for its services and managing the costs that are within its control 
the most volatile factors that drive costs of service primarily relate to workers compensation coverage  health benefit plans and state unemployment taxes 
the company seeks to manage these costs through the use of i workers compensation arrangements with carriers who efficiently manage claims administration  and the company s internal risk assessment and client risk management programs  ii appropriately designed health benefit plans that encourage client employee participation and efficient risk pooling  and iii aggressive management of its state unemployment tax exposure

liquidity and cash flows cash flow general the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of capital resources in view of its plans for expansion of its human resource outsourcing portfolio through acquisition  collateralization requirements for insurance coverage and other operating cash needs 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past sought  and may in the future seek  to obtain additional capital from either private or public sources 
certain types or amounts of financing will require the consent of the frontenac entities so long as they hold or are entitled to vote a majority of the series a preferred stock 
the company currently believes that its current cash balances  restricted marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its operational requirements for the next months  excluding cash required for acquisitions  if any 
the company s primary short term liquidity requirements relate to the payment of accrued payroll and payroll taxes of its internal and client employees  accounts payable for capital expenditures  the payment of workers compensation premiums and medical benefit plan premiums 
the company s billings to its clients include i each client employee s gross wages  ii a professional service fee which is computed as a percentage of the gross wages  iii related payroll taxes  and iv the client s portion of benefits  including medical and retirement benefits  provided to the client employees based on elected coverage levels by the client and the client employees 
included in the company s billings during were salaries  wages and payroll taxes of client employees of  million 
the billings to clients are managed from a cash flow perspective so that a matching exists between the time that the funds are received from a client to the time that the funds are paid to the client employees and to the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
as a co employer  and under the terms of the professional services agreement  the company is obligated to make certain wage  tax and regulatory payments 
therefore  the objective of the company is to minimize the credit risk associated with remitting the payroll and associated taxes before receiving the service fees from the client 
to the extent this objective is not achieved  short term cash requirements can be significant 
in addition  the timing and amount of payments for payroll  payroll taxes and benefit premiums can vary significantly based on various factors  including the day of the week on which a payroll period ends and the existence of holidays at or immediately following a payroll period end 
restricted cash at december   the company had million in total cash and cash equivalents  certificates of deposits and marketable securities  of which million was unrestricted 
the company is required to collateralize its obligations under its workers compensation and health benefit plans and certain general insurance coverage

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million 
the overall decrease in cash is primarily attributable to million of premium payments to aig for the workers compensation program in excess of projected claim liabilities 
of this amount  the company expects to receive approximately during as a return of premium from aig 
this reduction in cash was partially offset by the increase in net income during the year and other smaller changes in working capital items 
the company believes that it has a sufficient amount of restricted cash and marketable securities to cover its short term and long term workers compensation obligations related to its current open policy years with aig and cna 
cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  of million  primarily relates to the net purchases of restricted investments as a result of collateralization obligations for the aig workers compensation program  the use of for the teamstaff acquisition excluding the million of contingent purchase price held in escrow and included in restricted investments  and capital expenditures of million related primarily to information technology 
the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures primarily technology related during capital expenditures are expected to be funded through operations and or leasing arrangements

proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock totaling million were used by the company to purchase from charles s 
craig  a former director of the company   shares of common stock and  options to purchase common stock 
the remaining proceeds were partially used to fund the teamstaff acquisition on november  million with the remaining balance added to the company s working capital 
additionally  the company received approximately million from directors  officers and employees of the company upon the exercise of  stock options and the purchase of  shares of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
inflation the company believes that inflation in salaries and wages of client employees has a positive impact on its results of operations as certain amounts of the professional service fee earned from clients is proportional to such changes in salaries and wages

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the accounting estimates described below are those that the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while management has used its best estimates based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
management periodically reviews the estimates and assumptions and reflects the effects of revisions in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management has reviewed the critical accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the company in preparing its financial statements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
workers compensation receivable reserves 
the company has had a loss sensitive workers compensation insurance program since january  the program was insured by cna until december  and is currently insured by aig effective january  as part of these programs  the company has individual stop loss coverage at million per occurrence 
in addition  the company has aggregate stop loss coverage for individual claims that in total exceed the aggregate stop loss amount of of expected losses as determined by aig for the policy year and of expected losses as determined by cna for the policy years from january  through december  at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims incurred based on the company s current and historical loss development trends 
the estimated costs of the claims calculated may be revised by the independent actuaries based on developments relating to the actual claims incurred 
a certain amount of judgment is used in this estimation process by both the independent actuaries and the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the estimates made by the independent actuaries as well as other factors related to the company s workers compensation programs within the cost of services on the company s consolidated statements of operations and within the workers compensation receivable  the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation insurance reserves or the long term accrued health and workers compensation insurance reserves on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent that the premium payment to the carriers for the first million per occurrence of claims is greater than less than the amount of the ultimate liability accrued to date  a receivable liability is recorded 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is higher than the estimates determined by the independent actuaries  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could increase 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is lower than the estimates determined by the independent actuaries  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could decrease 
such increase or decrease to the accrual rate is reflected in the accounting period for which the change in the amount of workers compensation claims is calculated 
due to the considerable variability in the estimate of the amount of workers compensation claims  adjustments to workers compensation costs are sometimes significant 
in order to recognize the workers compensation cost obligations that are not expected to be received paid in the following year  the company includes a portion of the obligation as a long term receivable liability using an applicable discount rate 
fluctuations in the interest rate environment influence the selection of the discount rate 
increases in the discount rate result in a decrease in the net present value of the liability while decreases in the discount rate result in an increase in the net present value of the liability 
the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for workers compensation claims for each of the open policy years 
this table excludes the program year for the texas workers compensation insurance fund  which was a guaranteed cost program 
the second section  reading down  shows the number of claims reported 
the third section  reading down  shows the number of open claims as of the end of each successive year 
the fourth section  reading down  shows the amount of open case reserves as of the end of each successive year 
the fifth section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability 
the last section  reading down  shows re estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year  which is the result of the company s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table for workers compensation claims is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior plan years

all other estimated premium collateral return is expected to be long term 
medical benefit plan liabilities 
the company provides medical benefit plans to its client employees through several medical benefits plan providers under a minimum premium plan with bcbs  a retrospective premium plan with aetna for the aetna ppo plan and guarantee cost contracts for all other plans 
with respect to the medical benefit plans with bcbs  the company establishes medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves and the related health benefit plan subsidy are developed by an independent actuary using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including historical claim payment patterns and expected rates of increase in medical care costs 
the factor that has the greatest impact on the company s financial results is the medical cost trend  which is the rate of increase in health care costs 
with respect to the aetna ppo plans  the company establishes a liability if necessary based upon estimates provided by aetna if claims are higher than initially projected  up to the additional recall cap 
for each period  the company estimates the relevant factors  based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying the reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs  adjustments to health reserves are sometimes significant 
the following table provides the amount of the medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported medical benefit plan liabilities year ended december  medical benefit plan liabilities   if the actual amount of the company s medical benefit plan liabilities at the end of each period were to increase from the estimates used by the company  then the company would have an increase in the amount of its future period health benefit subsidy 
the company s financial statements reflect the estimates made within the cost of services on the company s consolidated statement of operations and within the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation reserves on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in order to give recognition to the medical benefit plan liabilities that are not expected to be paid in the following year  the company may include a portion of the obligation as a long term liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to pay their fees 
the company believes that the success of its business is heavily dependent on its ability to collect these fees for several reasons including the fact that the company is at risk for the payment of its direct costs and client employee payroll costs regardless of whether the clients pay their fees  the large volume and dollar amount of transactions processed by the company  and the periodic and recurring nature of payroll  upon which the fees are based 
the company has established very tight credit policies and generally requires its clients to pay in advance or simultaneously with the delivery of the payroll 
in addition  the company maintains the right to terminate its professional services agreement and associated client employees or to require prepayment  letters of credit or other collateral upon deterioration in a client s financial position or upon nonpayment by a client 
as a result of the company s tight credit policies  customer nonpayment have been historically low as a percentage of revenues 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate rapidly  resulting in non payment  the company s uncollected accounts receivable could grow rapidly and the company could be required to provide for additional allowances 
deferred taxes 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the company were to operate at a loss or is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  then the company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in the company s effective tax rate
