these increases in specialized manufacturing were offset by a decrease of approximately million in revenues from the company s canadian operation as it was reorganized in fiscal additionally  increased demand internationally in europe and asia pacific caused royalty revenues to increase  or to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal revenues in the company s electronic manufacturing services segment were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal however  this segment s revenues were negatively affected by the december sale of sunburst  which accounted for million in revenues in fiscal compared to million in the current fiscal year sunburst revenues were included for only three months of fiscal year prior to being sold 
the shortfall caused by the sale of sunburst was offset by an increase in revenues of million from the company s chase ems division  which is also part of the electronic manufacturing services segment 
the increase in chase ems sales was predominantly due to the strengthening of the hi tech market  which continues to rebound from the economic downturn suffered in and  and greater demand for specialized turnkey production from its existing and new customers 
export sales from continuing domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the change in export sales was due to the general improvement of the global economy

the company does not anticipate any material change to export sales during fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues was primarily a result of sales generated by the company s acquisitions of tapecoat acquired in fiscal and chase facile acquired in fiscal 
fiscal specialized manufacturing revenues increased over the previous year as this segment continued to benefit from the asset purchase of the tapecoat division as well as seven months of sales activity generated by the february acquisition of chase facile

the majority of the dollar value increase was a direct result of increased revenues in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this percentage increase was primarily due to the company s specialized manufacturing segment which experienced increased pricing pressure on raw material costs in fiscal coupled with increased sales of lower margin products 
additionally  sales related to the paper tyger product line have lower margins compared to some of the company s other divisions due to the higher cost of raw materials used in paper tyger products 
fiscal included nine months of paper tyger compared to no sales activity in fiscal  which was prior to the acquisition 
in fiscal  cost of products and services sold increased million or to million compared to million in the prior year period

the company has also invested in certain personnel that it believes are required to support continued growth in future periods 
bad debt expense  net of recoveries  decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in is a result of the financial difficulties of a long standing customer in the company s specialized manufacturing segment whose receivable balance was written off in fiscal loss on impairment of goodwill as discussed in the notes of the company s consolidated financial statements  in fiscal year  the company recorded a  charge related to the impairment of goodwill in connection with its sale of sunburst 
goodwill related to sunburst  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  which was realized upon the december  sale of sunburst 
the impairment was recorded in the company s first fiscal quarter ended november  while the effective date of the sale of sunburst for accounting purposes was december  in the second fiscal quarter ended february  interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the change in interest expense is a direct result of the company s ability to reduce overall debt balances through principal payments from operating cash flow offset by increases in the company s outstanding debt as a result of a the repurchase of common stock b the acquisition of paper tyger and c the acquisition of manufacturing equipment located in taylorsville  north carolina 
the company s debt will continue to be paid down through operating cash flow in fiscal the company continues to receive the benefits from favorable borrowing rates from its financial institutions

income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  the company has received the benefit of strong export sales and foreign tax credits 
in fiscal  the sale of sunburst created a capital loss carryforward for income tax purposes of approximately million 
this capital loss expires in and will be used to offset capital gains generated by the company in future periods 
as of august   management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefit of this capital loss carryforward and thus the deferred tax asset has been offset by a full valuation allowance 
accordingly  the company s annual fiscal effective income tax rate reflects this valuation allowance as well as less favorable state income tax rates in the form of a higher effective tax rate compared to prior fiscal years 
income before minority interest income before minority interest decreased in fiscal compared to prior year 
income before minority interest increased in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the  loss on impairment of goodwill related to sunburst  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  income before minority interest increased for the fiscal year compared to the prior year

in fiscal year  an impairment of  related to the company s investment in sgi was recorded due to changes in sgi s projected future cash flows due to the expected future loss of a key customer 
this impairment charge was determined based upon an updated understanding of sgi s businesses through discussions with sgi s majority shareholder as well as an analysis of sgi s projected future cash flows 
net income net income in fiscal decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
net income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in net income in the current fiscal year is a direct result of the three significant charges recorded in fiscal all of which are discussed above a the impairment of the company s investment in unconsolidated joint venture  sgi  of  b the impairment of goodwill related to sunburst of  and c the after tax losses of the company s canadian operations  which were approximately  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal included in the fiscal year loss for the canadian operations was approximately  in costs related to employee severance  stay bonuses  accelerated depreciation on certain manufacturing equipment  one time buy out of the building lease commitment  realization of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments  and other shut down costs

liquidity and sources of capital the company s cash balances increased  to  at august  from  at august  generally  the company manages its borrowings and payments under its revolving line of credit in order to maintain a low cash balance 
the relatively high cash balance at august  was primarily the result of the timing of year end cash collections that had not yet been used by the company to pay down its revolving line of credit 
consequently  the increase in cash at august  as compared to august  was offset by a corresponding increase in the balance of the company s line of credit as of august  cash flow provided by operations was  in fiscal compared to  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable balances which were higher as a direct result of increased sales volume in fiscal additionally  there were two significant non cash charges related to the loss on impairment of an unconsolidated joint venture  sgi  and impairment of goodwill related to sunburst 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  and as of august  the increase of the company s current ratio is primarily attributable to a higher cash balance as of august  combined with the elimination of notes payable to bank which related to sunburst and chase canada

this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
it requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
an enterprise that consolidates a variable interest entity is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity

this interpretation requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and an enterprise that holds significant variable interests in a variable interest entity but is not the primary beneficiary  to make certain disclosures about the variable interest entity 
application of this interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities other than small business issuers for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where the company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to it  a specific allowance against amounts due to the company is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the company 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
the company estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and records reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess an obsolete inventory and future charges 
investment in joint venture the company has an investment in a joint venture related to an area of the company s strategic focus 
the company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
in assessing the recoverability of this investment  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based on changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the joint venture  market conditions and the industry and economic environment in which the entity operates 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the joint venture could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
see notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which the company considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized based on commission statements received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  the company s efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which it operates
