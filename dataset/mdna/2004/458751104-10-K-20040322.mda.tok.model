item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  market and sell intuitive interface devices and components for a variety of business and home applications 
we generate revenues from the sale of our hardware products  such as fsr sensors  fsr based subassemblies and complete advanced input device products 
to a lesser extent  we derive revenue from the sale of software combined with our hardware 
depending on the application  this software may be internally developed or purchased from software partners 
we record our revenue in four different market segments business communications wireless intuitive input device products addressing the presentation market  home entertainment wireless intuitive input device and sensor products addressing the advanced tv viewing and home video game markets  e transactions input devices for the electronic signature markets  specialty components custom fsr based sensors  subassemblies and complete products for a variety of vertical markets 
we have addressed our specialty components market since our inception in our other three markets have evolved out of our specialty components market 
we have addressed our business communications market as a separate market since  our e transactions market since and our home entertainment market since the relative revenue and gross profit contributions of each of these segments is provided below in results of operations business segment overview 
cost of revenues includes material  assembly  labor in the us and contract labor in china  manufacturing overhead at our us facility and our china logistics center  software licensing and quality assurance costs 

table of contents historical financial performance the following chart shows revenues  gross profits and earnings by quarter since logo our revenues grew steadily from through the fourth quarter of principally as a result of increased sales of sensors and sensor components to the oem computer industry and  after  to sales to our business communications market 
in  primarily as a result of the downturn in the global economy  and in particular in the levels of business experienced by our oem customers  our quarterly revenues declined materially 
since the beginning of  our revenues have resumed a steady rate of growth due to a general improvement in the global economic climate and a broadening in the market for business presentation devices and the introduction of comparable products for consumer use 
other significant contributing factors have been sales of components for use in microsoft s xbox game controller and increases  particularly in  in sales in our e transactions market 
gross profits have generally trended with revenues except in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of in both of those quarters we recorded material write offs of obsolete inventory 
earnings have shown more quarter to quarter fluctuations than revenues but generally trended upward as revenues increased from through we began to experience quarterly losses in the second quarter of  which continued  except for a break even third quarter of  through the end 
table of contents of in  earnings resumed and generally trended upward during the year 
in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we experienced significantly larger losses than in other loss quarters 
in both cases  the unusual amount of the loss was attributable principally to write offs of obsolete inventory 
beginning in the third quarter of  we were able to limit losses despite a continuing decline in revenues by implementing an austerity program that included reductions in employee levels and strict cost controls 
in implementing this program  we eliminated much of our sales and marketing efforts in our home entertainment segment and thus have a limited ability to influence near term increases in that segment 
prior to  operations was a net user of cash that we funded through existing cash balances  private placements of equity and  to a lesser extent  bank and lease financing 
in  operations was a net provider of cash  generating million 
in  and  operations was essentially cash flow break even to marginally positive 
operations again consumed significant cash in the first three quarters of to fund the working capital requirements of our growth in the branded business communications market but improved slightly in the fourth quarter 
we believe that we have emerged from a difficult period for our industry with a history of recent losses but with a technology and product portfolio and a market and customer base that positions us well for growth that we expect to continue and  perhaps  to accelerate 
however  as the period clearly demonstrated  we are vulnerable to the effects of macroeconomic trends that may cause our expectations to be wrong 
the reader should keep in mind that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results 
current opportunities and challenges a considerable portion of our effort is directed at emerging markets  such as our e transactions market where our success depends on our ability accurately to forecast the nature  amount and timing of market requirements in an environment in which historical precedent is limited or non existent 
we rely on information generated by our internal staff and industry partners and on independent market studies for forecasts of market demand in our focus areas but these studies are themselves based on limited empirical data 
an inaccurate forecast of market demand in any of our core market areas would impact our short term performance and could impact our competitive position and  therefore  our long term performance 
our quarterly results are often affected by volatility in orders for a particular product 
for example  sales of sensors for the microsoft xbox constitute a significant source of revenue but are substantially dependent on xbox sales that we cannot control or accurately forecast 
similarly  sales to large institutions of our e transactions products typically come in relatively large orders that can be one time events or can occur at widely dispersed intervals 
other factors that could cause our estimates to be wrong or could result in trends that are not apparent from our financial statements are described under risk factors contained elsewhere in this annual report 
management faces the constant challenge of balancing its investment in new technology  product development and marketing initiatives against the objective of steady earnings growth 
a decision to make a significant investment in a new technology  product or marketing effort may have a short to medium term negative impact on earnings even if the investment proves to be justified 
because we 
table of contents intend to pursue a growth strategy  it is probable that we will make investments in new business opportunities that will increase operating costs  decrease margins and negatively impact earnings until the investment produces significant revenue growth 
we expect to use cash in the future to support growth through the purchase of new technologies or businesses and through internal technology  product and market development efforts 
we expect to generate cash from existing operations and  depending on actual cash requirements  may seek to obtain cash from commercial borrowing and or additional sales of securities 

table of contents results of operations business segment overview revenue and gross profit by market segment are shown in the following table market segment s percent of total sales s percent of total sales s percent of total sales business communications revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue home entertainment revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue e transactions revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue specialty components revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue all segments revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  business communications in our business communications segment  we sell wireless remote controls on an oem basis to the leading manufacturers of presentation projectors 
we also sell interlink branded wireless remote controls and keyboards direct to computer products retailers  corporate resellers and distributors 
in  oem revenues comprised approximately of business communications revenues as compared to in overall  business communication revenues grew 
oem revenues grew  reflecting an approximate growth in units coupled with an approximate decline in average selling prices 
in  oem average selling prices ranged from revenues from branded products  which had average selling prices of approximately before special price reductions grew 
the growth in oem units is consistent with the growth in the presentation projector market 
the oem average selling price decline is reflective of competitive price pressure affecting the industry as a whole 
the branded unit volume increase results from our efforts to expand our channel customer base and broaden our product line 
business communication gross margin in was compared to in but the gross margin in was reduced by approximately by the inventory write off million recorded in fourth quarter of the decline in gross margin  excluding the impact of inventory write offs  was due to the oem average selling price decline discussed above 
home entertainment in our home entertainment segment  we sell remote controls on an oem basis to manufacturers of advanced tv viewing devices including projectors sold for tv viewing and fsr sensors to microsoft for integration into their xbox game controller 
revenues related to the xbox program accounted for approximately of our home entertainment revenues in home entertainment revenues remained relatively flat as compared to  reflecting a slight decline in xbox related revenues and an offsetting improvement in sales of remote controls for advanced tv viewing devices 
home entertainment gross margin improved to in from in due to increased sales of higher margin remote controls for advanced tv viewing devices 
e transactions in our e transactions segment  we sell electronic signature capture devices and  depending on the customer requirement  signature capture software 
we offer annual software maintenance agreements and hardware upgrade programs to our existing customers  however  historically we have not recorded significant revenues from those type of sales 
e transaction revenues increased over due to greater industry adoption of the e pad product line and a large sale to a major us bank recorded in fourth quarter of e transaction gross profit as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent with we expect e transaction gross profit margins to remain relatively the same in 
table of contents specialty components in our specialty components segment  we sell custom fsr s and fsr based subassemblies to many customers in several vertical markets  such as medical devices  industrial input and military input products 
specialty components revenues were down in as compared to due to greater competition in the industrial input market 
specialty component gross margin improved to in as compared to in due to the lower amount of relatively lower margin industrial input sales in operating expenses product development and research costs include internal engineering labor  contract engineering and outside processing costs for the design and development of our oem and branded designs and products and the research of our technologies 
for  our product development and research costs increased over due to development of new products in our branded business communication and e transaction segments 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and research costs declined to in from in due to sales growth leverage 
however  we expect that product development and research costs will continue to exceed of revenues for the foreseeable future 
sales  general and administrative costs sg a include sales  marketing  accounting and administrative labor  sales commissions  advertising  general marketing  branded business communications channel marketing and travel and entertainment costs 
for  sg a grew over due to increased branded business communication channel marketing costs and increased sales commissions and general marketing commensurate with sales growth 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a declined to in versus in due to sales growth leverage 
in summary  our improved operating results in were attributable to the following factors growth in revenues that occurred in our business communications and e transactions sectors  the inventory write off in that did not occur in  and growth in operating expenses supporting the growth in revenues 
total other income expense improved to a positive  in versus a negative  in due to lower interest expense due to lower debt levels partially offset by lower interest income from lower invested cash levels 
we have million in net operating loss carryforwards nols for us federal tax purposes 
in and  for accounting purposes  we recognized some of those nols as an accrued tax benefit 
however  because of our subsequent losses in and  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
this non cash charge reduced the net value of the deferred tax assets on the balance sheet to zero 
current accounting standards place significant weight on a history of recent cumulative losses in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
forecasts of future taxable income are not considered sufficient positive evidence to outweigh a history of losses 
accordingly  the assets were reserved in full 
the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards are not impacted and can continue to be utilized for up to years 
the net income generated in is not necessarily indicative of future results 
therefore we have maintained the full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  in  we recorded income tax expense related to our hong kong subsidiary 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  business communications our principal source of revenue in continued to be our business communications market 
sales in this segment recorded a net decline of in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the quarterly sales decline  a result of overall economic conditions that began in first quarter  reversed direction in first quarter and we recorded a sequential quarterly improvement throughout this improvement was led by increased revenue in our us based oem business  which increased over due to the addition of new customers 
our japan based oem business declined compared to due to lower unit sales with existing customers 
our oem business comprised of total business communications revenues in as compared to our branded business improved over with the expansion of our branded product line and increased number of distribution and reseller customers 
gross margins for the business communications segment declined in due to the million fourth quarter write off of obsolete inventory related to our japanese subsidiary  partially offset by the improving product mix of branded products 
home entertainment home entertainment revenues increased by in due to the success of the microsoft xbox program 
the xbox program accounted for and of total home entertainment revenues in and  respectively 
home entertainment gross margin declined in due to the shift of the product mix to higher volume lower margin programs eg the xbox program 
e transactions e transactions segment revenues increased in over due to an increase in the number of larger volume customers and a slight improvement in the general economic climate for corporate capital expenditures for information technology products 
also  in late  we introduced epad ink to the epad product line 
gross margin for e transactions for remained consistent with specialty components specialty components revenues declined in due to the termination in third quarter of of the licensing agreement with iee 
revenues associated with the iee program totaled million 
gross margin for the specialty components segment improved in due to the allocation to this segment of a portion of the million write off of obsolete inventory recorded in second quarter of 
table of contents operating expenses product development and research expense decreased from million in to million  in this decrease is a result of a reduction in the usage of outside development firms and a lower headcount as part of the cost reduction plan initiated in mid selling  general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease is a result of the cost reduction programs initiated in mid and maintained throughout the key factors of the cost reduction plan were a reduction in personnel across all departments  a hiring and salary freeze and a reduction in outside marketing costs 
other income in reversed to a net expense in due to the lower interest rates achievable on cash investments 
in  we recorded an additional deferred tax asset of  related to our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
due to a lack of quarterly profitability  we suspended further additions to the deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of and in the fourth quarter of we recorded a valuation allowance against the remaining balance million by recording a tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources have historically come from sales of equity securities and commercial borrowing 
at times since  operations has been a net generator of cash 
our principal historical cash requirements have been to fund new product and technology development  to support sales  marketing  inventory and accounts receivable cost and to fund losses in loss periods 
while we expect continuing operations to generate cash  we anticipate that additional capital resources will be required to support future growth and expect to rely on additional sales of securities and commercial financing to provide the required resources 
to some extent  we expect that our rate of growth will be within our control and  accordingly  we expect to adjust our growth commitments to reflect the availability and attractiveness of financing arrangements and non growth related cash requirements 
cash flow comes principally from collection of accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  from interest or other return on financial investments 
we maintain what we believe to be appropriate reserves for doubtful accounts and are not aware of any prospective development that would impact collections differently from our historical experience 
on two occasions  we have made substantial inventory reserve adjustments that reflect management s judgment as to the recoverable value of inventory 
we do not currently anticipate the need for a further inventory adjustment but any significant diminution in inventory value would ultimately affect cash flow 
we have million of credit availability under our us bank line of credit  none of which was used as of december  the availability of this credit is subject to various conditions and to our continuing compliance with certain covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the applicable covenants and are not aware of any prospective development that would cause us to fail to be in such compliance 
we currently have modest commitments for capital expenditures and no material purchase obligations 
our long term debt and operating lease obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table total less than year years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total 
table of contents in february  we renegotiated and extended the terms of our camarillo  california facilities 
the new lease adds  to our lease commitments and  to our lease commitments in  and these amounts may increase as we pursue our growth strategy but the amount of any such growth will depend on the particular requirements of any growth commitment  the availability and attractiveness of equity capital arrangements and our general liquidity position 
working capital decreased from million at december  to million at the end of and increased to million at december  the decrease in is a result primarily of the operating loss for the year  while the increase in reflects improved results during the period and proceeds from the exercise of employee and management stock options 
except for the credit facilities described above  we have no commitments with respect to future capital resources 
operations generated a positive cash flow of  in operations used million in  all of it in the first three quarters 
the improvement in was due primarily to improved accounts receivable collections coupled with the favorable timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the primary uses of cash in the first three quarters of were investments in working capital accounts receivable and inventory designed to facilitate our further penetration of the business communications branded channel  partially offset by the managed extension of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decrease in use of cash in the fourth quarter of was due primarily to improved operating results 
we expect to generate a positive cash flow from operations in we spent  in and  in to purchase additional manufacturing and computer equipment 
we received proceeds from unsecured long term bank loan primarily from japanese banks of  in  which was used to fund working capital requirements for our japanese subsidiary 
we made payments on long term debt of million and  in and  respectively 
net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stockholder loan repayments were  and million in and  respectively 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory and the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and no 
b 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and require management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
to satisfy the criteria  we input orders based upon receipt of a customer purchase order  record revenue upon shipment of goods and when risk of loss and title has transferred  confirm pricing through the customer purchase order and  validate creditworthiness through past payment history  credit agency reports and other financial data 
other than through warranty rights  our customers do not have explicit or implicit rights of return 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  such as a determination that collectibility was not reasonably assured  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable are unsecured  and we are at risk to the extent such amounts become uncollectible 
we continually monitor individual account receivable balances  and provide for an allowance of doubtful accounts at the time collection may become questionable based on payment performance or age of the receivable and other factors related to the customer s ability to pay 
inventory reserve 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of forecast sales levels by product and historical demand 
we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our cost or market value and result in a new cost basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write down may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
provision for income tax 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation reserve 
to the extent we establish a reserve or increase this reserve in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation reserve recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we first achieved profitable operations in because of net operating loss nol carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we did not accrue income tax expense until in that year  due to the expiration or full utilization of nol carryforwards in california and japan  we began to record a provision for income tax expense in those jurisdictions 
by the end of  we also began to accrue an income tax benefit related to our federal nol carryforwards to be used in future periods 
however  in mid  we began to record quarterly tax losses and suspended any further recognition of nol carryforward tax benefits 
in the fourth quarter of and for the year  based on historical and prospective evidence  we concluded that we did not have sufficient evidence to be able to recognize our nol carryforward benefits as assets and thus we recognized a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset balance 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal  state and foreign income tax purposes of   and  respectively  which are available to offset future taxable income in those jurisdictions through 
table of contents foreign exchange exposure 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communications market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately and of our revenues for and  respectively  came from japanese customers 
revenues from these customers are denominated in japanese yen and as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure 
we use revenue forecasts from our japanese subsidiary to determine the amount of our forward contracts to purchase and we attempt to enter into these contracts when we believe the yen value is relatively strong against the us dollar 
to the extent that our revenue forecast may be inaccurate or the timing of forecasting the yen s strength is wrong  our actual hedge gains or losses may not necessarily correlate with the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our revenues 
we mark these contracts to market value and the gain or loss from these contracts is recorded in business communications revenue 
these hedge transactions are classified as economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
in addition  because our japanese subsidiary s functional currency is the yen  the translation of the net assets of that subsidiary into the consolidated results will fluctuate with the yen dollar exchange rate 
the following table illustrates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our yen denominated revenues and the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activity in thousands 
increase decrease in revenues resulting from foreign currency fluctuations hedging gains losses net revenue impact we calculate the increase decrease in revenues resulting from foreign currency fluctuations by calculating the us dollar equivalent of our yen denominated revenues using the yen dollar exchange rate at the beginning of the period 
the resulting product is compared to our yen denominated revenues converted to us dollars according to gaap and the difference is shown in the table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our japanese subsidiary  interlink electronics kk  generally makes sales and collects its accounts receivable in japanese yen 
to hedge these revenues against future movements in exchange rates  we purchase foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are then offset by gains or losses on the underlying revenue exposure and consequently a sudden or significant change of foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on net income or cash flows to the extent future revenues are protected by forward currency contracts 
these contracts  however  typically have a six month duration 
thus  yen dollar fluctuations lasting more than six months will have an impact on our revenues 
during  and we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the normal course of business to manage our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and costs associated with financial and global operating activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes from bankers 
at december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million 
during fiscal  we recognized  of losses on foreign currency exchange contracts which is reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging policies are designed to offset the effect of a yen devaluation on our revenues  thus  a hypothetical devaluation of the yen would reduce our yen denominated revenues by  but our theoretical hedging gains would offset that effect for a period of time 

table of contents interest rate exposure based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt as of december   would have no material impact on earnings or cash flows  over a one year period
