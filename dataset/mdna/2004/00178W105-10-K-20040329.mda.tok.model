item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item below 
general since  our business and operations have been significantly affected by the acquisitions of  or acquisitions of the assets of  miracle mountain international  inc  chambre international  inc  stay n shape international  inc  solution products international  inc  nation of winners  inc  now international  inc 
 toppmed inc 
and lifescience technologies inc  or lst 
over the years  these acquisitions and asset purchases have added  associates to our ranks and products to our product line 
lst was our most recent acquisition 
on january   we purchased the lst group of companies for million and a five year payment of  per month  or of the gross sales of lst products  whichever is greater 
the seller had the option to take up to  shares of our common stock in lieu of cash at an option price of per share 
as a result of this acquisition  we added products and over  associates 
we paid the balance of the acquisition price  plus accrued interest  in full on january  we have historically earned a material portion of our revenues from our am product  which contains ephedra 
in  the fda banned the use of ephedra in nutritional supplements 
while the fda s decision had an adverse effect on our revenues  we had been preparing for this contingency 
over the last several years  through strategic acquisitions  product redevelopment and refocus of weight loss products  we have built a multi product peak performance  weight loss and nutritional product line that is predominately non ephedra 
we have seen positive results in converting our am customers to am ephedra free or other weight loss products in states like new york  illinois and california that have previously banned ephedra 
a majority of the customers have chosen one or more of our other performance based weight loss and nutritional products 
we anticipate the same positive results with our remaining am customers 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the fda ban on ephedra will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table sets forth information used by management to assess our results of operations over the prior three years  both in aggregate amounts and the percentage increase or decrease over the prior year increase increase decrease decrease net sales    gross profit    net income loss     free cash flow     average monthly purchases per associate total associates    active associates    free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures 
cash flow from operations    capital expenditures    free cash flow    average monthly purchases per associates is calculated by dividing total sales by total number of associate transactions 
below we discuss the reasons for the reductions in the above matrices for versus and to reverse this trend  we have emphasized the recruiting of new sales associates as our best model for growth in we believe we can attract and retain experienced and new sales associates through our wellnessceo system  our new compensation plan  our refocused product offerings  and our new customer acquisition program 
critical accounting policies 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
throughout this report  net sales represents the gross sales amounts reflected on our invoices to our associates less associate discounts  sales returns  and  beginning june   a portion of freight costs 
all of our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee 
our products may be returned within days of purchase for a full refund or credit toward the purchase of another product 
we also have a buy back program whereby we repurchase products sold to an independent associate subject to a restocking fee  provided the associate terminates his her associateship agreement with us and returns the product within months of original purchase in marketable condition 
we receive our net sales price in cash or through credit card payments upon receipt of orders from associates 
our gross profit consists of net sales less commissions and bonuses  consisting of commission payments to associates based on their current associate level within their organization  and other one time incentive cash bonuses to qualifying associates  cost of products  consisting of the prices we pay to our manufacturers for products and royalty overrides earned by qualifying associates on sales within their associate organizations  and a portion of the cost of shipping  consisting of costs related to shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to associates  and similar expenses 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products  training aids and promotional material to our independent associates 
all of our customers pay for sales in advance of shipment 
as such  we have no trade receivables 
we used to make loans to associates  which were repayable in five years or less  and which were secured by commissions controlled by us 
associate loans are no longer allowed 
interest rates on loans were typically two percent or more above the prime rate and were fixed 
all loans and receivables were secured by guaranteed payment sources that were within our control 
as such  there was no need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we were still collecting on prior associate loans as of december  in the total amount of  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires companies to stop amortizing existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  under the new rules  companies would only adjust the carrying amount of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets 
we implemented these standards effective january  based on an evaluation of goodwill at october   we determined that goodwill of approximately  was impaired and should be written off in its entirety 
we write down our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if written off inventory is sold 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable than an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonable estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
many legal and tax contingencies can take years to resolve 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
however  an adverse outcome in these matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
units offering 
on november   we completed the offering of  units  each consisting of one share of common stock and one redeemable common stock purchase warrant 
each redeemable common stock purchase warrant was exercisable for the purchase of one share of our common stock for on or before november  in connection with this offering  we sold to the underwriters  paulson investment company  inc and joseph charles assoc  inc  warrants exercisable for the purchase of  units for per unit on or before november  on september   we extended the exercise period for the redeemable stock purchase warrants and the underwriter warrants from november  to november  on october   we extended the exercise period for the redeemable stock purchase warrants and the underwriter warrants from november  to november  on december  we announced the redemption of all outstanding redeemable stock purchase warrants and the underwriter warrants not exercised by january  rather than have their warrants redeemed  substantially all of the holders of the redeemable stock purchase warrants and the underwriter warrants exercised their warrants on or before the redemption date

accounting standards to be adopted in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vies  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin  as revised by fin r  addresses the application of arb no 
to vies  and generally would require that assets  liabilities and results of the activity of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that is considered the primary beneficiary 
this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
we have not created or obtained an interest in any vies 
in addition  the interpretation becomes applicable on december  for special purpose entities spes created prior to february  as of december   we had no spes for which we were considered the primary beneficiary 
for non spes in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february   the fasb has postponed the date on which the interpretation will become applicable to march  we have determined the adoption of the provisions of fin  as revised by fin r  will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on one issue with respect to eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  thereby requiring certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
adoption of eitf issue  which was effective for us on december   did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the required disclosures have been considered in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
the primary purpose of sab no 
is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
and the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq related to multiple element revenue arrangements in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
we do not expect the issuance of sab no 
to significantly impact our current revenue recognition policies 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity  by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the consolidated balance sheets 
further  sfas no 
requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives 
the guidance in sfas no 
generally is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and was otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have evaluated sfas no 
and determined that it does not have an impact on our financial reporting and disclosures 
commitments and contingencies recent regulatory developments as a marketer of products that are ingested by consumers  we are subject to the risk that one or more of the ingredients in our products may become the subject of adverse regulatory action

product liability we  like other marketers of products that are intended to be ingested  face the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage with limits of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate 
products containing ephedra  which represented approximately of our net sales  are not covered by our product liability insurance 
we generally do not obtain contractual indemnification from our product manufacturers 
however  all of our product manufacturers carry product liability insurance  which covers our products 
a product liability claim could result in material losses 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in five products liability suits related to the ingestion of our ephedra based products 
answers to these petitions have been or soon will be filed  and written discovery and responses have been or soon will be exchanged 
we have  and will continue to  deny any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
the amounts of damages sought are unknown  but include compensatory and punitive damages 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity has been cash provided by sales of our common stock  marketable securities and operating activities 
at december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  we also added  in january from the exercise of warrants 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  net cash used in investing activities was  and net cash provided by financing activities was  we had a net increase in cash during this period of  our working capital needs over the next months consist primarily of marketing  distribution and administrative expenses  and will be provided by our operating activities and existing cash and cash equivalents

these loans were paid in full in no new loans will be made to our officers or directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our balance sheet includes marketable securities  which we believe are a conservative blend of income and growth investments resulting in moderate market risk 
we invest in equity marketable securities to generate capital growth  and fixed income marketable securities to provide current income 
because of the nature of these investments  both current interest rates and equity market movements will affect total return and risk 
our fixed income investments of approximately  are subject to interest risk and market value risk 
we have approximately  of equity investments that are exposed to market risk 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain an investment portfolio of high quality fixed income marketable securities 
all securities are available for sale and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we do not hedge our investment portfolio or our outstanding credit facility or other long term indebtedness 
fixed income investments with a maturity date of three months or less at the date of purchase are deemed to be cash equivalents 
any remaining fixed income securities are considered short term and mainly consist of investments in us treasury notes and bonds 
the following table lists our cash equivalents and our short term fixed income marketable securities at december  and december  december  december  average average interest fair interest fair rate cost value rate cost value cash equivalents     short term investments     average interest rate is calculated by taking the individual security interest rates multiplied by each investment s weighted average share of the total fixed income marketable securities 
at december  all of our fixed income securities were in mutual funds  creating no average interest rates for fixed income securities 
fair value of the cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities decreased  during the year ended december  to  from  at december  this decrease was primarily due to net redemption of fixed income securities 
equity market risks 
we currently maintain an investment portfolio of equity securities 
all securities are available for sale and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we do not engage in hedging our equity portfolio or otherwise purchase derivative securities 
because of the quality of our portfolio and liquid nature of our equity investments  we do not consider the market risk related to these investments to be material 
at december   our equity investments had a value of  compared to  at december   primarily due to the purchase of mutual fund equity investments in the second  third and fourth quarters of we attempt to manage our interest and market risk by evaluating and purchasing what we believe to be the best investment securities and rates of return available
