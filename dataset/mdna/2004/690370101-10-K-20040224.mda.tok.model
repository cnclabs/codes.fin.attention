item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth under special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth in the following discussion and under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an online closeout retailer offering discount brand name merchandise  including bed and bath goods  kitchenware  watches  jewelry  electronics  sporting goods  designer accessories and travel 
our company  based in salt lake city  utah  was founded in  and we launched our first website through which customers could purchase products in march our revenue is comprised of direct revenue  fulfillment partner revenue and warehouse revenue 
during no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenue other than safeway  inc  which accounted for of our total revenue 
direct revenue includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses  which are fulfilled from our warehouse in salt lake city  utah 
we generate business to business bb sales when we contact retailers by phone and e mail and offer them our merchandise below wholesale prices  allowing them an opportunity to be more price competitive in their local markets 
after we establish a relationship with a bb client  the client sometimes places subsequent orders directly through our bb website 
our bb calling effort began in october  so our historical direct revenue has predominantly been based on individual consumer purchases made directly through our consumer website 
our fulfillment partner revenue is derived from two sources  consumer fulfillment partner revenue and bb fulfillment partner revenue 
consumer fulfillment partner revenue is generated when we sell merchandise of other retailers  cataloguers or manufacturers fulfillment partners through our consumer websites 
prior to july   we did not own or physically handle the merchandise we sold in these transactions  as the merchandise was shipped directly by a third party vendor  which also handled all customer returns related to those sales 
beginning july   we took responsibility for all returned items relating to these sales and we now handle the resale of any returned items 
as a result  beginning july   we are considered to be the primary obligor for these sales transactions  and we assume the risk of loss on the returned items 
as a consequence  we now record revenue from sales transactions involving our fulfillment partners excluding travel products on a gross basis  rather than recording a commission on sales as we did prior to july  similar to the manner in which we generate consumer fulfillment partner revenue  we generate bb fulfillment partner revenue when we sell the merchandise of third parties through our bb website 
our use of the term partner or fulfillment partner does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our fulfillment partners 
during the fourth quarter of  we added a discount travel store to our website 
we use fulfillment partners to supply the travel products flights  hotels  rental cars  etc 
in our store 
for the products sold in our travel store  we do not currently have inventory risk or pricing control  and do not provide customer service 
therefore  for these sales we are not considered to be the primary obligor  and record only our commission as revenue 
our warehouse revenue is derived primarily from sales of products that cannot be economically sold on our websites due to their low price points  bulk  irregular size or other factors 
historically  we held our warehouse sales in various physical locations 
we held our first warehouse sale from november to january  primarily to liquidate residual products from the purchase of the entire inventory of a distressed toy retailer 
we initiated a second warehouse sale in february  primarily to liquidate residual products from our acquisition of gear 
com 
sales from our warehouse store in accounted for less than of total revenue 
we closed the warehouse store in january our revenue is recorded net of returns  coupons and other discounts 
in february  we implemented a policy intended to reduce the number of returned products 
this new policy provides for a restocking fee and the provision that we will not accept product returns initiated more than fifteen days after the shipment date 
we charge a restocking fee instead of the handling fee on all returned items from the electronics computers department 
cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the product  as well as inbound and outbound freight  fixed warehouse costs  warehouse handling costs  credit card fees  and customer service costs 
bb gross margins are typically less than individual consumer gross margins 
therefore  future overall gross margins will be impacted by the blend of net revenues from the consumer and bb sales channels 
cost of goods sold also includes related stock based compensation for each respective period 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  public relations and promotional expenditures  as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities 
advertising expense is the largest component of our sales and marketing expenses and is primarily attributable to expenditures related to online marketing activities and our offline national radio and television branding campaign launched during the third quarter of for example  our advertising expenses totaled approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods on an absolute dollar basis as we expect to continue to increase our online marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses consist of wages and benefits for executive  accounting  technology  merchandising and administrative personnel  rents and utilities  travel and entertainment  depreciation and amortization and other general corporate expenses 
amortization of goodwill during resulted from the acquisition of gear 
com  inc in november we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  under this pronouncement  the remaining goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
there were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended december  and we have recorded no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes as we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net operating loss carryforwards  of which million is subject to limitation for those respective years 
these net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding its realizability 
both direct and fulfillment partner revenue are seasonal  with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter  reflecting higher consumer holiday spending 
we anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future 
with the exception of our acquisition of gear 
com  we have achieved our historical growth from internal operations 
executive commentary the following executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management 
as an executive commentary  it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business  including the following the difference between our revenue reported under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and our gross merchandise sales  changes we made to our merchandise returns policies during that affect our gaap revenues  the increases in our gross merchandise sales and factors contributing to the increases  certain issues relating to our operations  certain issues relating to our expenses  certain issues relating to our capital resources and liquidity  and the status of certain of our strategic projects 
this executive commentary is intended as a supplement to  but not a substitute for  the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein 
investors are cautioned to read our entire management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as our audited financial statements  and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere in this report 
this executive commentary includes forward looking statements  and investors are cautioned to read the special note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
commentary changes to our returns policies 
at the beginning of the third quarter of  we changed our merchandise return policies and procedures to permit our customers to return all items directly to us  rather than to the fulfillment partner who may have shipped the merchandise to the customer  and we are now considered the primary obligor 
as a result  our gaap revenue increased significantly and gross margins decreased significantly in the third and fourth quarters compared to previous reporting periods 
investors should understand that a significant portion of the increase in our gaap revenues resulted solely from this change  and consequently  that gross merchandise sales comparisons year over year may be more informative than gaap revenue comparisons for the affected periods 
we also believe gross profit dollar comparisons year over year may be more informative than gross margin percentage comparisons 
commentary gaap revenue and gross merchandise sales 
management believes that to understand our business and our financial statements  investors should understand the difference between our gross revenues as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles  and the non gaap measure we call gross merchandise sales 
gross merchandise sales gms represents the gross sales price of all sales transactions  including those for which the company has recorded only a commission under generally accepted accounting principles  and therefore differs from gaap revenue 
management believes that gross merchandise sales provides useful information to investors because it represents the total sales price of the merchandise sold via the overstock websites or through our other business to business sales channels  regardless of the amount of gaap revenue recorded by overstock on those sales  which varies  depending on  among other things  the returns policies applicable to the merchandise sold via the website 
management uses the measure of gross merchandise sales for internal planning purposes  including measuring the company s growth  measuring the effectiveness of marketing expenditures  and capacity planning for information technology  customer service and logistics 
in the future  our gaap revenues are likely to constitute approximately of our gross merchandise sales  and the difference between the two measures will be less significant than in the prior years 
the following table reconciles our gross merchandise sales to our gaap revenues for the quarter and year ended december  in millions 
three months ended december  year ended december  total revenue add obligations payable to third parties upon sale of third party merchandise add sales returns and discounts gross merchandise sales as mentioned above  we believe gross profit dollar comparisons year over year may be more informative than gross margin percentages comparisons 
in the fourth quarter of  our gross profits increased to million from million in the fourth quarter of note that this increase is  on a percentage basis  much smaller than our gms growth gross profits increased  while our gms increased 
for the year ended december   gross profits increased to million from million gross profits increased  while our gms increased 
the difference is accounted for partially by our decision to sell books  music  and videos at extremely slim margins  and also by some of the expense control issues discussed below 
commentary increases in gross merchandise sales 
in  the company experienced year over year growth in gms of almost 
in the first two quarters of  our year over year growth in gms was and  but dropped in the third quarter to 
in the fourth quarter of  our gms growth increased to over the fourth quarter of this was due to several factors customer acquisition and marketing we attracted  new customers during the fourth quarter of  bringing the number of customers who have bought from us to just over three million 
our average cost per new customer  or customer acquisition cost cpa as it is called in our industry  was for the fourth quarter  compared with  and in the first three quarters of  and in the previous year fourth quarter 
cpa is calculated by taking our total marketing expenses  excluding only our bb sales force compensation costs which represented less than of total marketing expenses  divided by the number of new business to consumer customers bc 
given that our cpa for the fourth quarter included a national branding effort that accounted for almost half of our total marketing expenses in the quarter  we consider this result very good 
historically  we have acquired new customers almost exclusively through various online advertising channels 
we try to generate at least a dollar of gross profit for every dollar we spend for online marketing  so that our online marketing pays for itself on the first purchase 
we have difficulty finding sufficient advertising channels that meet our objective  and not all of our advertising channels always reach it 
however  if we are able to locate channels that meet our standards  we may spend as much as million on online advertising in as mentioned above  we made a significant investment in a national television and radio branding effort in the fourth quarter of based on independent surveys that we commissioned over the course of the quarter  the public s reported awareness of our website increased significantly 
according to the surveys  adult unprompted awareness of overstock 
com went from to  while adult prompted awareness went from to for comparison  the same surveys show ebay and amazon 
com  with roughly adult prompted awareness 
in addition  we experienced significant increases in website traffic during the campaign  and based on our own statistical analysis of the traffic and resulting customers  we believe that we received approximately to cents in gross profits for every dollar we spent on television and radio advertising 
this is below our online marketing standard 
however  we believe that we realized other benefits from the national branding effort  including greater awareness with vendors and manufacturers 
we also expect that the branding effort will increase the effectiveness of our online advertising as more people recognize our name and have a better understanding of our product selection and pricing 
we intend to decrease our spending in this area in the first quarter of  but expect to increase it again in the future 
conversion our marketing efforts are designed to attract visitors to our website 
after we attract a visitor  we attempt to convert the visitor into a purchaser 
we are working to improve our conversion ratio by improving various aspects of our website  including the improvements we made to the search function on our website by installing an easyask search engine during the third quarter of we believe that we still have room for significant improvement in our search function 
in addition  we have begun to develop personalization and optimization algorithms that select products for customers and repeat visitors based on behavior and other factors 
we are in the initial stages of this effort 
commentary operations warehouse approximately half of the product ordered from our website is shipped from our salt lake city warehouse 
though we publicize a standard of shipping within two business days of receipt of order  under our internal standards  we try to ship orders received by pm mountain time the same day 
two weeks before thanksgiving  when the surge of christmas orders first started  we slipped a day behind our internal standard  and then even further behind during the thanksgiving weekend 
however  we recognized the problem  devoted significant executive and key employee time and attention to it  and by december we were generally shipping within hours of receipt of orders  by december we were shipping within hours of order  and by december  we were shipping the same day of the order 
by the end of december  we were again shipping of orders within hours  and within hours 
customer service during the fourth quarter of  we answered emails within hours of the time  and answered phone calls within seconds of the time 
we consider that good  but we consider some of our response times hold times as long as three minutes  for example unacceptable 
we are addressing this issue aggressively 
information technology for our website to handle the continued growth in  we needed to expand our existing technology infrastructure 
rather than acquire a multi million dollar superdome or mainframe  we chose to implement a less expensive  cutting edge  node database cluster a cluster is a database distributed across multiple interconnected servers 
in october  our system was beginning to reach its capacity constraints  and we switched over to the new database cluster 
over the fourth quarter our information technology team refined this system with support from oracle 
in the process we experienced insignificant amounts of downtime  and we believe that we now have a more reliable and scalable system and website 
commentary expense discipline warehouse as discussed above  as a result of falling a few days behind in fulfillment at the warehouse  we incurred additional expenses in order to ship packages faster 
we estimate that we incurred a few hundred thousand dollars in expenses in order to quickly increase our shipping capacity and fulfill customer orders on a timely basis 
customer service with the benefit of experience  we believe that we can reduce our costs of providing future customer service 
we have now implemented changes  including the outsourcing of a portion of our customer service staff  that we believe will decrease our overall cost per customer contact  while maintaining the level of customer service that we have historically provided 
compensation our total compensation expense including benefits for was approximately million 
in early we reduced our staff  resulting in a reduction of our future compensation expense  on an annual basis  of approximately million 
investors should note  however  that we will hire additional staff during  and that we therefore may not realize a million reduction in our compensation expense compared with further  we do not expect to make similar cost reductions in future years 
commentary inventory  liquidity and related matters inventory 
we ended running low on inventory 
an unexpectedly strong january depleted it further  and by february we believe that our low inventory levels choked sales 
in an effort to avoid a repeat of this situation  we ended with inventory sufficient to support growth 
we believe that our current inventory level and selection are appropriate  with the possible exception of our opportunistic purchase of over million of franck muller watches in the closing weeks of we have limited experience selling these watches  which typically sell for over  each 
we believe that we now offer them at some of the lowest prices in the world 
cash and marketable securities 
we ended with million in cash and marketable securities  but at one point during the fourth quarter our cash was down to million 
there is an aspect of the cash flow of our business that is different than most other businesses 
a typical business running at breakeven profitability absorbs cash as it grows to fund increased working capital needs  and releases cash as it shrinks as working capital declines  all else being equal 
overstock is different about half of our business is our fulfillment partner business  where we sell a product through our website and collect the cash from a credit card transaction within a few days  but pay our fulfillment partner to days later 
because we collect cash for the sale before we pay our fulfillment partner  the fulfillment partner portion of our business generates temporary liquidity that we call float cash 
if we were running at break even profitability but our fulfillment partner business were growing  our growth would generate float cash 
if we shrank  we would lose float cash again  all else being equal 
this dynamic is the reverse of that displayed by the typical business 
investors should understand that a portion of the million cash and marketable securities we held at december  was cash we owed to our fulfillment partners 
due to the seasonality of our business  our fulfillment partner business is expected to shrink in the first quarter of  so we expect our cash balance to decrease during the first quarter of approximately proportionate with the decrease in sales by our fulfillment partners 
capital needs 
in addition to the other matters discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  management periodically analyzes our capital resources  liquidity  and anticipated needs 
one of the analyses our management performs periodically assumes that we will operate our business at break even and grow each year  and then assesses our need for capital under those assumptions 
as discussed above  since the fulfillment partner portion of our business generates float cash as we grow  our need for additional capital may be less than the need of other businesses 
however  as mentioned above  at our lowest point in the fourth quarter  our cash balance was as low as million 
that may be insufficient in the future 
we are not yet at break even  as our gaap loss in the fourth quarter of was of revenue 
we will continue to look at our capital needs and try to position ourselves so that we will be able to raise capital if circumstances are appropriate 
in addition  we are in the process of obtaining an inventory line of credit 
commentary strategic projects following is a brief update on some of our recent strategic projects  some of which are also discussed above 
search engine 
as discussed above  we have implemented an easyask search engine 
we consider this superior to our old system  but believe that we can continue to improve our search function substantially 
branding campaign 
as discussed above  we launched our overstock 
com the big o branding campaign through national television and radio ads  and we believe that we realized significant benefits from this campaign 
travel 
we opened a travel department in the third quarter  which generated more than  of bookings in the fourth quarter 
in we included only the net commissions realized on travel bookings in our gaap revenues and in our gross merchandise sales 
in our net commissions from the travel department were insignificant 
commentary worldstock one additional project to report on is our worldstock department  which sells handmade goods made primarily in underdeveloped countries throughout the world 
while representing only a couple percentage points of our overall sales  worldstock has generated about million in revenue in the months it has been open  with approximately gross profit margins 
based on assumptions management considers reasonable  we estimate that our worldstock department has lost a little less than million since its inception and its inventory now ties up approximately another  in cash 
worldstock purchases products from about  artisans in the developing world and has been growing quickly 
the balance of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically  the reserve for returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete and damaged inventory  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources i direct revenue  which consists of merchandise sales made to consumers and businesses that are fulfilled from our warehouse  ii fulfillment partner revenue  which consists of revenue from the sale of merchandise shipped by fulfillment partners directly to consumers and other businesses  and iii warehouse revenue  which consists of sales of residual products from large bulk purchases of inventory 
both direct revenue and fulfillment partner revenue are recorded net of returns  coupons redeemed by customers  and other discounts 
with regards to our fulfillment partner revenue  prior to july   we did not own or physically handle the merchandise sold in these transactions  as the merchandise was shipped directly by a third party vendor  who also handled all customer returns related to those sales 
beginning july   we took responsibility for all returned items relating to these sales  and we now handle the resale of any returned items 
as a result  beginning july   we are considered to be the primary obligor for these sales transactions  and we assume the risk of loss on the returned items 
we now record revenue from sales transactions involving our fulfillment partners on a gross basis  rather than recording a commission on sales as we did prior to july  similar to the manner in which we generate consumer fulfillment partner revenue  we generate bb fulfillment partner revenue when we sell the merchandise of third parties through our bb website 
for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  as amended  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
any amounts received prior to when we ship the goods to customers are deferred 
reserve for returns  allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete and damaged inventory 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the reserve for returns was million as of december  from time to time  we may grant credit to certain of our business customers on normal credit terms 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
as of december   we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of  overstock writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or damage equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was million  net of allowance for obsolescence or damaged inventory of million as of december  accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax asset balance due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
effective january   we have adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but must be tested for impairment at least annually 
other long lived assets must also be evaluated for impairment when management believes that an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
there were no impairments of goodwill or long lived assets during   or net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue for  and year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue direct revenue fulfillment partner revenue warehouse revenue total revenue cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net net loss comparison of years ended december  and revenue beginning july   customer returns from sales shipped by our fulfillment partners are returned directly to us and processed through our salt lake city warehouse  rather than returned to our fulfillment partners  as they previously were 
we made the decision to change this policy to have more control over the overstock customer shopping experience  as we believe that a seamless customer experience is key to creating loyal  long term customers 
by accepting returns at our warehouse  we can verify that fulfillment partner products are being packaged and shipped to our standards 
additionally  as customer returns are now all shipped to one location  the process is much more simple and convenient for our customers 
as a result of this change in business practices  we now record sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of on a net basis  as we have historically done 
therefore  from the third quarter forward  revenue recorded in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap will increase significantly from our results as reported in previous sec filings 
additionally  as illustrated in the table above that sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue for  and  direct revenue as a percentage of total revenue will decrease significantly while fulfillment partner revenue as a percentage of total revenue will increase 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross merchandise sales non gaap comparisons may be more informative than gaap revenue comparisons  as gross merchandise sales were not affected by the change in business practices 
total revenue grew from million in  to million in  representing growth of 
during this same period  direct revenue increased from million to million  or a growth  and fulfillment partner revenue grew from million to million representing growth of 
warehouse revenue remained constant at million for the years ended december  and the significant increase in total revenue was due primarily to the change in our business practices described above  coupled with an increase in the number of both direct and fulfillment partner orders and sales to other businesses 
this increase was also a result of the growth of our bc business due to increased marketing efforts  including the initiation of a nationwide television and radio advertising campaign that began in the third quarter of and continued through the fourth quarter 
gross merchandise sales totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of 
gross merchandise sales differ from gaap revenue in that gross merchandise sales represent the gross sales price of goods sold by the company before returns  sales discounts and before payments to fulfillment partners prior to july  cost of goods sold as a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of  we now record sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have historically done 
therefore  gaap revenue increased significantly beginning in the third quarter of  which resulted in a significant increase in cost of goods sold and hence  a decrease in gross margins from previous quarters 
these margins will now more closely resemble margins we receive from our direct revenue 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross profit dollar comparisons may be more informative than gross margin percentage comparisons 
cost of goods sold increased in absolute dollars  from million in to million in  and as a percent of total revenue  from to  respectively 
this increase in cost of goods sold  as a percent of total revenue  was primarily a result of the change in our business practices described above 
in addition  cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of total revenue due to the growth in sales of bmv products  which account for approximately of total revenue in  compared to less than in these combined changes correlate to gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold also includes stock based compensation of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profits for our direct operations increased to million for the year ended december   from million recorded during the same period in for our direct operations  gross profit dollars increased on a year over year basis while sales increased 
gross profits for our direct operations  as a percentage of direct revenue decreased from in to in this was primarily due to increased costs related to capacity expansion at the warehouse  as well as an increase in warehouse handling expense as we ramped up staffing and packaging in anticipation of sales increases 
additionally  overall returns costs increased significantly as we increased capacity and staffing for increased returns volumes due to the returns policy change  and due to process inefficiencies that were identified and fixed during the third and fourth quarters 
cost of goods sold on sales transactions from our fulfillment partners now includes the cost of the product  warehousing and fulfillment costs  credit card fees and customer service costs 
therefore  beginning in the third quarter of  overall blended gross margins will be significantly lower than they have historically been 
now that the costs related to the initial implementation and process refinement of the fulfillment partner returns process have been absorbed in the third quarter  future gross profit dollars generated from these sales should not be significantly affected by this change 
our fulfillment partner operations generated gross profits of million margins and million margins for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit dollars for our fulfillment partner operations was due to the general growth of the consumer business during the year  and an increase in the number of fulfillment partner products offered on our websites 
the decrease in gross margins for our fulfillment partner operations is largely due to the change in our business operations described above as well as an increase in bmv sales from of fulfillment partner revenue in to in margins for bmv products have historically been much lower than those of other product categories 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increased marketing expense reflects increased online marketing efforts  particularly with the large portals msn  yahoo aol  and with our affiliate marketing program 
in addition  during we initiated our first national radio and television campaign  which added approximately million to the marketing expense in the current year over the previous year 
we expect total marketing expenses to continue to increase in the future as a result of the expenses related to online marketing agreements that we have recently entered into and similar online or offline radio  television  or other similar agreements that we may enter into in the future 
the decrease in sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenue was due to the increase in total revenue in which was a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to costs associated with building infrastructure  including expansion of corporate systems and additional personnel costs from increased corporate headcount 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due to the increase in total revenue in which was a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of amortization of goodwill 
effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
hence  we did not record any goodwill amortization during the years ended december  and amortization of stock based compensation 
prior to the company s initial public offering in may  the company recorded unearned stock based compensation related to stock options granted below the fair market value of the underlying stock 
since the initial public offering  the company has not granted any additional stock options below fair market value 
amortization of stock based compensation was approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
the increase in interest income from  in to  in is due to the increase in our cash and marketable securities from our follow on offering in the first quarter of interest expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of our termination of our inventory lines of credit in june and the reduction in our capital leases 
other income expense changed from expense of  in to income of  in primarily because the company paid  of selling costs on behalf of a selling shareholder as part of the initial public offering in income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently paid insignificant amounts of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards  of which million is subject to limitation 
these net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue grew from million in  to million in  representing growth of 
during this same period  direct revenue increased from million to million or a growth  and fulfillment partner formerly commission revenue grew from million to million representing growth of 
warehouse revenue was  in and million in  representing growth of 
the increase in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in the number of both direct and commission orders and in the average order size 
this increase was also a result of the growth of our bc business due to increased marketing efforts and increased sales to other businesses  including safeway  inc the increase in warehouse revenue from to was due primarily to an establishment of a permanent location for our warehouse store at our warehouse facility in july of for the warehouse sale in  we liquidated part of a large inventory purchase from toytime 
com during january of that year 
for the warehouse sale in  we liquidated the remnants of the gear 
com inventory that occurred during the latter end of the first quarter and the first part of the second quarter of the gross merchandise sales of goods sold directly by us and on behalf of third parties were million in and million in  an increase of 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased in absolute dollars from million to million in this represents a decrease  as a percent of total revenue  from in to in the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue in compared to was primarily a result of economies of scale achieved through an increased number of sales transactions and efficiencies in operations 
these efficiencies include  but are not limited to  efficiencies in the actual costs paid to suppliers for goods  freight and handling costs  the costs of customer service and returns 
the decrease is also attributable to an increase in fulfillment partner revenue as a percentage of total revenue from in to in  as fulfillment partner revenue has higher gross margins than direct revenue 
cost of goods sold also includes  and  of stock based compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased on an absolute dollar basis from million in  to million in primarily as a result of our increased online marketing expenditures  including fixed payment arrangements in connection with online marketing relationships 
however  this represents a decrease as a percent of total revenue from to 
the decrease in marketing costs as a percentage of total revenue as compared to reflects an effort by our management to focus advertising expenditures on campaigns that it believes are the most cost effective to increase net sales  such as targeted online advertising  as well as negotiating reduced rates charged to us for online marketing

general and administrative expenses increased from million in  to million in representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to new business development and the staffing necessary to manage and support our growth 
general and administrative personnel increased from employees at the end of  to employees at the end of the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was a result of economies of scale achieved through increased sales volume and the allocation of general and administrative expenses over a substantially larger revenue base 
amortization of goodwill 
effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
hence  we did not record any goodwill amortization during fiscal year during  million was recorded as amortization of goodwill for the fiscal year ended december  goodwill resulted from the acquisition of gear 
com in november amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation was approximately  and million in and  respectively 
we attribute this increase primarily to amortization of non cash deferred stock based compensation recognized relating to options grants during the respective periods 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
interest income was  in compared to  in interest expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of the reduction in notes payable 
other income expense changed from income of  in to expense of  primarily because the company paid  of selling costs on behalf of the selling shareholder as part of the initial public offering

 additional operating data gross merchandise sales in thousands    number of orders     number of new bc customers    average customer acquisition cost the additional operating data sets forth certain operating data relating to our business for the eight most recent quarters for the period ended december  while we believe that the information in the table above facilitates an understanding of our business and results of operations for the periods presented  such information is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should be read in conjunction with the quarterly results of operations data set forth above 
we believe that gross merchandise sales is a metric widely used in our industry and by making this metric available to investors  we believe investors are able to compare our performance against others in our industry 
we believe that investors may use the average customer acquisition cost metric to determine how efficiently we are able to achieve growth  if any 
again  we believe this metric is widely used in our industry  and providing these values to investors enables them to make more meaningful comparisons 
gross merchandise sales represents the gross sales price of all sales transactions  including those for which we only record a commission under generally accepted accounting principles  and therefore differs from gaap revenue 
beginning  july  we changed our business practices regarding returns  which affected our fulfillment partner revenue 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross merchandise sales non gaap comparisons may be more informative than gaap revenue comparisons  as the gross merchandise sales were not affected by the change in business practices

 as a percentage of total revenue direct revenue fulfillment partner revenue warehouse revenue total revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss amounts include stock based compensation of amounts exclude stock based compensation as follows sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses our direct revenue and fulfillment partner revenue have increased in every quarter on a year over year basis 
the general increase in total revenue is due to the expansion of our customer base as we attracted more visitors to our websites  as well as repeat purchases from these customers 
we have experienced significant seasonality in our business  reflecting a combination of seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality patterns 
internet usage and the rate of internet growth may be expected to decline during the summer 
further  sales in the traditional retail industry are significantly higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year than in the preceding three quarters 
fulfillment partner revenue increased significantly during the past two quarters due to the change in our business practices 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue has fluctuated during the eight quarters ended december   ranging from to 
the significant increases during the rd and th quarters of relate specifically to the change in business practices in our fulfillment partner operations and the resulting shift from recognizing revenue on a commission basis to a gross basis 
total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue have decreased on a year over year basis each quarter during as compared to as a result of economies of scale achieved through increased sales volume 
in the near future  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  and expect that total operating expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue will vary depending on the level of revenue obtained 
due to the foregoing factors  in one or more future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the second quarter of  we financed our activities primarily through a series of private sales of equity securities  warrants to purchase our common stock and promissory notes 
during the second quarter of  we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other related expenses 
additionally  in february  we completed a follow on offering pursuant to which we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other related expenses 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was million at december  we also had marketable securities of million at december  our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million for the year ended december  and net cash inflows of million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash and cash equivalents during was to fund our normal operations  including net losses of million  and changes in accounts receivable million  inventories million  and prepaid expenses and other assets million 
this was offset by the change in accounts payable million and accrued liabilities million 
cash used in investing activities included million in capital expenditures for property and equipment  including million in the third quarter for expansion of our existing warehouse facility  a new customer service telephone system  and upgrades to the existing internal database 
these expenditures were offset by a net increase of million in cash and cash equivalents from the purchase and sales of marketable securities 
for the year ended december  and  net cash provided by used in investing activities amounted to million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of net proceeds of million received from the follow on public offering which occurred in february and approximately million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by  of payments on capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering in may and the issuance of preferred stock in march  offset by the repayment of million of notes payable 
on march   we sold  shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock at per share for million  net of issuance costs 
as the fair value of the common stock to be received upon conversion of the preferred stock was greater than the conversion price of the preferred stock at the date the preferred stock was issued  a beneficial conversion feature resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million which was recorded in the first quarter of this non cash charge was recorded as a deemed dividend  of which million is attributable to shares sold to the following related parties  john j

contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt arrangements capital lease obligations operating leases    purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations    amounts of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years letters of credit   redeemable common stock   total commercial commitments    the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders we had outstanding at december  under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less 
the estimated amount of redeemable common stock is based solely on the statutes of limitations of the various states in which stockholders may have rescission rights and may not reflect the actual results 
the stock is not redeemable by its terms 
we do not have any unconditional purchase obligations  other long term obligations  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
we have a million revolving letter of credit facility  which expires june   which we use to obtain letters of credit supporting our inventory purchases 
at december  the issuing bank or an affiliate of the bank had letters of credit totaling million outstanding under this facility 
however  we have no liability for this amount except to the extent  if any  that a beneficiary of any of the outstanding letters of credit draws upon a letter of credit 
in evaluating our contractual obligations and commitments  investors should understand that the amount shown above under letters of credit is duplicative of a portion of the amount shown above under purchase obligations  because we have no actual liability in connection with the letter of credit facility other than for commitment fees and similar items except to the extent that we fail to pay a similar amount included above in purchase obligations 
we believe that the cash and marketable securities currently on hand will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months 
while we anticipate that  beyond the next twelve months  our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operational requirements  we may require additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that if additional financing is necessary it will be available  or  if available  that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see factors that may affect future results 
seasonality financial results for internet retailers are generally seasonal 
based upon the company s historical experience  increased revenues typically occur during the fourth quarter because of the christmas retail season 
the actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product and competition  among other risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect the company s results of operations in the future 
the following table reflects the company s revenues for each of the quarters available since in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter note that the revenue for the third and fourth quarters of reflect the change in company policy in which sales by fulfillment partners are now recorded gross instead of net as in prior quarters 
factors that may affect future results any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties  and all other information in this form k before deciding whether to purchase or hold our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  trade accounts and contracts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings or loss  or the fair market value or cash flows of these instruments
