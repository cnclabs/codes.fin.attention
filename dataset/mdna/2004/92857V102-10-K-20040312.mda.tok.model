we depend on third parties for manufacturing 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture our products 
we do not own most of the equipment  tools  and molds used in the manufacturing process  and we have only limited control over the manufacturing processes 
as a result  certain difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  including any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturers that result in product defects  production delays  cost overruns  or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis 

table of contents our operations would be adversely affected if we were to lose our relationship with any of our suppliers  if any of our suppliers operations were interrupted or terminated  or if overseas or air transportation services were disrupted even for a relatively short period of time 
we do not maintain an inventory of sufficient size to provide protection for any significant period against an interruption of supply  particularly if we were required to locate and use alternative sources of supply 
we rely on lge as a strategic partner 
we rely on lge to supply most of our key telephone systems and voice mail products and all of our commercial grade telephones 
we also rely on lge s engineering  hardware and circuit development  and manufacturing capabilities 
we purchased approximately million  million  and million of product from lge and lgst  constituting approximately   and of our total purchases in   and  respectively 
we currently obtain products from lge and lgst on a purchase order basis and cannot provide assurance that we will be able to secure long term manufacturing arrangements for the products we currently obtain from lge and lgst 
lge has no formal commitments to support our business or operations 
markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we engage in an intensely competitive business that has been characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change  and foreign competition 
we compete with major domestic and international companies 
many of our competitors have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we possess 
emerging companies also may increase their participation in the telephone systems and peripherals markets 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control  including the following the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing  and diversity of our product lines  the performance of our distributors and dealers  the quality of our customer services  our ability to address the needs of our customers  our success in designing and manufacturing new products  including those implementing new technologies  the availability of adequate sources of raw materials  finished components  and other supplies at acceptable prices  our suppliers efficiency of production  the rate at which end users upgrade or expand their existing telephone systems  applications  and services  new product introductions by our competitors  the number  nature  and success of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our products  including their ease of use and reliability  as well as price  timely delivery  and after sale service and technical support 
we may not continue to be able to compete successfully in the future 

table of contents we face risks associated with patents  licenses  and intellectual property 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements  and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses  and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes 
we face risks associated with our intellectual property  including the following the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to protect misappropriation of such rights  third parties may independently develop equivalent or superior technology  the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and patents may not issue from future applications  existing patents or any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us meaningful protection or any commercial advantage  we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources  and we may commence litigation to enforce patents or other intellectual property rights  or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our management s attention 
as is typical in the telecommunications industry  we have received from time to time  and in the future may receive  allegations of possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
based on industry practice  we believe that in most cases we could obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms 
in the event that a third party alleges that we are infringing its rights  we may not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from the third party  if at all  or the third party may commence litigation against us 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or the occurrence of litigation arising out of such claims could materially and adversely affect us  our result of operations  or prospects 
our third party manufacturers may experience shortages of raw materials and supplies 
the principal raw materials and components used in producing our products consist of semiconductor components  unfinished printed circuit boards  molded plastic parts  and metals 
the third party manufacturers of our products acquire these raw materials primarily from asian sources  which indirectly subjects us to certain risks  including supply interruptions and currency price fluctuations 
we and our third party manufacturers from time to time experience difficulties in obtaining these materials 
the suppliers of these materials currently are adequately meeting our requirements and those of our third party manufacturers 
we also believe that there are alternate suppliers for most of these materials 
we depend on management and other key personnel 
our development and operations to date have been  and our proposed operations will be  substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management and technical personnel 
we have employment agreements gregory k 
roeper  our president and chief executive officer  david a 
husband  our vice president 
table of contents finance and chief financial officer  and steven r 
francis  our vice president sales and marketing 
we maintain agreements with each of our officers and employees that prohibit them from disclosing confidential information obtained while employed with us 
the loss of existing key personnel or the failure to recruit and retain necessary additional personnel would adversely affect our business prospects 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or that we will be able to attract and retain necessary additional personnel 
our internal growth and the expansion of our product lines will require additional expertise in such areas as software development  operational management  and sales and marketing 
such growth and expansion activities will increase further the demand on our resources and require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
our failure to attract and retain personnel with the requisite expertise or to develop internally such expertise could adversely affect the prospects for our success 
certain conflicts of interest may arise as a result of lge s ownership interest in our company 
lge currently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we obtain most of our digital telephone systems  ip based products  and voice mail products from lge and obtain all of our commercial grade telephones and replacement parts for such telephones from lgst  an affiliate of lge 
see item  business manufacturing and risk factors we rely on lge as a strategic partner 
as a result of lge s direct ownership interest in us  an inherent conflict of interest exists in establishing the volume and terms and conditions of our purchases from lge and lgst 
in order to mitigate such conflicts  all decisions with respect to such purchases are made by our officers and reviewed by directors who have no relationship with lge 
our relationship with lge may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of us  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders 
through lge s stockholder interest and business interests in our company  lge may have significant influence over our business 
our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock in the public securities market could be subject to a variety of factors  including the following wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors  actual or anticipated announcements of technological innovations or new product developments by us or our competitors  significant actual or anticipated expenditures for property or equipment  research and development  sales and marketing activities  or other planned or unanticipated events  changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  regulatory developments  general industry conditions  and worldwide economic and financial conditions 
the trading volume of our common stock in the past has been limited  which may increase the volatility of the market price for our stock and reduce the liquidity of an investment in shares of our common stock 
during certain periods  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in particular  prices for many technology stocks often fluctuate widely  frequently for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents the absence of an active trading market  which may occur if we are required to delist our shares from nasdaq smallcap market  would likely make our common stock an illiquid investment 
the nasdaq stock market has certain rules that must be met in order for a listed company to maintain its listing on nasdaq 
during fiscal  we moved the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
we may be required to delist from the nasdaq smallcap market if we fail to comply with those rules 
should that occur  market makers may choose to create a market for our common stock on the over the counter bulletin board 
if that does not occur  our stock could be traded in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau 
as a result  investors would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of  our shares 
rights to acquire our common stock could result in dilution to other holders of our common stock 
as of march   we had outstanding options to acquire  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
an additional  shares remain available for grant under our stock option plan  and  shares remain available for grant under our incentive compensation plan 
during the terms of these options  the holders thereof will have the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the common stock 
additionally  all outstanding options become fully vested and exercisable upon a change of control of our company 
the existence of these options may adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional financing  and the holders of these options can be expected to exercise such options at a time when we  in all likelihood  would be able to obtain additional capital by offering shares of our common stock on terms more favorable to us than those provided by the exercise of these options 
sales of additional shares of our common stock could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities 
most shares of common stock currently outstanding are eligible for sale in the public market  subject in certain cases to compliance with the requirements of rule under the securities laws 
shares issued upon the exercise of stock options granted under our stock option plan generally will be eligible for sale in the public market 
we also have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of one or more series of preferred stock 
the issuance of such shares could dilute the voting power of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock and could dilute earnings per share 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be in the best interest of stockholders 
we are subject to provisions under delaware corporate law that would require us to obtain certain approvals from our board of directors or stockholders in order to engage in a business combination with an interested stockholder under certain circumstances 
our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain a number of other provisions relating to corporate governance and to the rights of stockholders 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors  authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with such voting rights and other powers as our board of directors may determine  and require the affirmative vote of two thirds of the directors then in office to approve a public offering of our capital stock  the merger with or the acquisition of another business or the acquisition of a significant amount of the assets of another business  the sale of a significant amount of our assets  our entering into contracts with our stockholders or directors  
table of contents our assumption or acquisition of debt in excess of million  and any amendment of our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws of our wholly owned subsidiary vodavi communications systems  inc these provisions in our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of us  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  bad debts  sales returns  excess and obsolete inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements customer incentives we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements  price protection for our distributors  promotions  and other volume related rebate programs 
such reductions to revenue are estimates  which are based on a number of factors  including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer redemption rates  sales volumes  and inventory levels at our distributors 
if actual results differ from our original assumptions  revisions are made to our estimates that could result in additional reductions to our reported revenue in the period the revisions are made 
additionally  if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase the level of customer incentive offerings that could result in an incremental reduction of revenue in the period in which we offer the incentive 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  we have a significant concentration of accounts receivable with our two largest distributors  graybar electric company  inc and target 
as of december   graybar accounted for and target accounted for of our total accounts receivable 
if either graybar or target s financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments to us  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
sales returns we maintain allowances for estimated sales returns 
while we have distribution agreements with our largest distributors that limit the amount of sales returns on active products  we generally allow unlimited returns of products that we discontinue 
accordingly  the timing and amount of revisions to our estimates for sales returns is largely influenced by our decisions to discontinue product lines and our ability to predict the inventory levels of such products at our largest distributors 
revisions to these estimates have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported amount of revenue in the period in which the revisions are made 
we generally do not accept product returns from our direct dealers unless the product is damaged 
excess and obsolete inventory we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
our assessment of market value is determined by  among other things  historical and forecasted sales activity  the condition of specific inventory items  
table of contents and competitive pricing considerations 
when the assessed market value is less than the historical cost  provision is made in the financial statements to write down the carrying amount of the respective inventory items to market value 
if actual results are less favorable than our original assumptions for determining market value  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain revenue and expense items 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
revenue cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses engineering and product development selling  general  and administrative operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before taxes and accounting change income tax expense benefit income loss before accounting change change in accounting principle net income loss special charges during the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan aimed at reducing our operating expenses to coincide with our revised sales outlook 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce  discontinued our interactive voice response product group  and implemented broad based price reductions on certain product lines 
these actions created severance related obligations of  estimated shut down costs of  and estimated distributor price protection obligations of additionally  in light of deteriorating economic and industry conditions and planned introductions of new products in the first quarter of  we re evaluated the carrying amount of certain receivables and inventory items resulting in additional accounts receivable reserve requirements of  and inventory impairments of  the pre tax financial impact of these initiatives during totaled approximately million consisting of both cash and non cash charges

while the sts telephone system has been accepted well into the marketplace  sales of this product have had the effect of reducing the level of sales of similar products that we sell through supply houses 
sales through our direct dealer program totaled million in compared with million in the increase in sales to our direct dealers is reflective of our program to focus on selling to fewer  but larger and better established  dealers that are more effective at selling our larger systems

these items resulted in a reduction to revenue of  in compared with a reduction of  in gross margin our gross margin was approximately million in compared with million in our gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to during from during the decrease in our gross margin percentage during was a direct result of the product mix of sales to our supply house customers with a heavier emphasis of sales of our new sts telephone system  which generates a lower overall gross margin percentage than most of our other products 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenditures decreased to million during from million in the expenditures in reflected additional headcount and outsourced development costs associated with a development project that we completed in pursuant to a development agreement with lg electronics

we estimated that our supply house customers reduced their inventory of our products by approximately million during compared with a reduction of million during sales through our infinite direct dealer program increased approximately  or  to million  or of our total revenue during  compared with million  or of our total revenue during the increase in infinite product sales can be attributed to selling to fewer  but larger and better established dealers that are more effective at selling our larger systems

the increase in gross margin percentage between the periods was slightly offset by our decision to sell certain discontinued product lines in in a bulk sale transaction for  at no margin 

table of contents engineering and product development engineering and product development expenditures increased to million in compared with million in during  we incurred additional salaries and personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount and field trial activities 
during we also engaged third party consultants to a greater extent than to assist in the development of some of our products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses declined approximately million  or  to million in compared with million in excluding special charges of approximately  recorded in  selling  general  and administrative expense declined by approximately  or  in the reduction was the net effect of a number of factors including a the discontinuance of our interactive voice response business  b decreased sales  marketing and promotional expenses  c a reduction in bad debt expenses  and d a reduction in depreciation and amortization  including the elimination of goodwill amortization of  associated with our adoption of sfas no 
these reductions were partially offset by additional operating expenses of our direct sales office of approximately  during compared to zero in and the cost associated with the settlement of litigation in of  interest expense interest expense decreased to approximately  in compared with  in the decrease in interest expense is a direct result of our debt reduction efforts during and lower borrowing costs

our accounts receivable days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  were approximately days as of december  compared to days as of december  the timing of payments received from our largest distributors and the linearity of our revenue streams during the quarter significantly influenced our days sales outstanding and our liquidity 
our two largest distributors accounted for of our total accounts receivable as of december  and as of december  an increase in concentration from our two largest distributors generally had the effect of increasing our days sales outstanding while a more linear revenue stream during the quarter had the effect of reducing our receivable days sales outstanding 
our inventory turnover  measured in terms of days sales outstanding on a quarterly basis  was days as of december  compared to days as of december  the decrease in inventory days outstanding was a direct result of a higher volume of sales in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of and our efforts to rationalize our product lines 

table of contents trade payables and accrued liabilities  including payables to third party and related party manufacturers  were approximately million as of december  compared with million as of december  the level of our trade payables and accrued liabilities between periods was largely influenced by the timing of payments we make to our largest suppliers for inventory items and payments to cover payroll and customer rebates

we had a million credit facility with general electric capital corporation that expired in april the line of credit bore interest at over the day commercial paper rate 
advances under the line of credit were based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory of our wholly owned subsidiary  vodavi communications systems  inc  and were secured by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving line of credit contained covenants that are customary for similar credit facilities and also prohibited our operating subsidiaries from paying dividends to our company without the consent of ge capital 
in april  we entered into a credit agreement with comerica bank california comerica of a size that is more reflective of the current capital requirements of our business

in addition to interest on the term balance  we will be required to make monthly payments of principal in an amount sufficient to fully amortize the term balance over a thirty six month period 
the million term loan was available to us only for the purpose of acquiring our common stock
