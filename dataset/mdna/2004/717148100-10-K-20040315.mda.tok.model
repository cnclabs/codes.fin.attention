item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those contained in the discussion on forward looking statements that follows this section and those contained in special factors relating to our business 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
overview we have grown significantly through organic growth and acquisitions 
in  we made one material acquisition 
the table below reflects the length of time each of our principal operating subsidiaries operated during each year for which we present audited financial statements in this report 
number of months each subsidiary is included in operating results sfbc miami sfbc ft 
myers sfbc analytical anapharm sfbc charlotte sfbc new drug services clinical pharmacology danapharm we merged sfbc charlotte into sfbc new drug services in april danapharm was a subsidiary of the company from march  through june and its results were reported using the equity method 
synfine and sfbc anapharm europe which commenced operations in march and november  respectively  are not considered material 
highlights for include our revenue increased to approximately million from approximately million  our earnings increased to approximately million from approximately million  our earnings per share increased to from per share  we raised approximately million after underwriting discounts but before expenses to us in our november secondary offering  we acquired clinical pharmacology in august  we acquired the of danapharm we did not own  we moved into a new  square foot phase i facility in ft 
myers  fl  and through a joint venture interest  we opened a bioanalytical laboratory in barcelona  spain 
our revenue consists primarily of fees earned for services performed under contracts with branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug company clients 
typically  a portion of our contract fee is due upon signing of the contract  and the majority of the contract fee is generally paid in installments upon the achievement of certain agreed upon performance milestones 
our contracts are typically terminable immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts usually require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  payment to us of fees earned to date  and in some cases a termination fee 
historically  since most of our contracts have been phase i and phase ii trials which are of short duration  we have not experienced any significant terminations of contracts in progress 
we record our recurring operating expenses in two primary categories  direct costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
direct costs consist primarily of participant fees and associated expenses  direct labor and benefits  facility costs  depreciation associated with facilities and equipment used in conducting trials  and other costs and materials directly related to contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of net revenue vary from period to period  due to the varying mix of contracts and services performed and to the percentage of revenue arising from our canadian operations which have higher direct costs 
selling  general and administrative costs consist primarily of administrative payroll and overhead  advertising and public relations expense  legal and accounting expense  travel  depreciation and amortization related to amortizable intangibles 
the gross profit margins on our contracts vary depending upon the nature of the services we perform for our client 
gross margins for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials and bioanalytical services generally tend to be higher than those for our phase iii trials management and other services that we perform 
within our phase i and phase ii business  our gross profit margins are generally higher for trials which involve a larger number of participants  a longer period of study time and the performance of more tests 
gross margins for our services to branded drug clients generally tend to be higher than those for generic drug clients 
in addition  our gross profit margins will vary based upon our mix of domestic and international business 
gross margins are calculated by subtracting direct costs from net revenue 
gross profit margins are calculated by dividing the gross margin by net revenue 
our canadian operations  which primarily provide services to generic drug companies  have historically employed a higher relative number of research and development employees and incurred higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue than our united states operations 
the canadian government subsidizes a portion of these additional expenses through tax credits 
under united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  these credits are applied against income tax expense rather than against the underlying selling  general and administrative expenses or direct costs that generated the credit 
as a result of the acquisition of our canadian operations  which occurred in march  we expect our future effective tax rate to be permanently lower as compared to our tax rate of in our effective tax rate was in and in our future effective tax rate will be dependent on the amount of the tax credits we receive in connection with our canadian operations and the relative contribution of our canadian operations to our consolidated pre tax income 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and the company s actual results are subject to the special factors relating to our business contained at the end of this section 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue and cost recognition 
revenues from contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation in the event of cost overruns due to changes in the level of work scope 
renegotiated amounts are included in revenue when earned and realization is assured 
provisions for losses to be incurred on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which it is determined that a loss will result from performance of the contractual arrangement 
direct costs include all direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change in the near term and the change could be material 
included in revenue and direct costs are pass through costs for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
the amounts are approximately  in  in  and  in included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
advance billings represent amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance of contract changes are based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its clients  analysis of subsequent changes in contracts  analysis of delinquent accounts  the payment histories of the accounts and management s judgment with respect to current economic conditions and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management reviews its accounts receivable aging on a regular basis for past due accounts 
any uncollectible amounts are written off against the allowance 
management sets specific reserves for clients in poor financial condition and general reserves for the remaining clients based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major client default on it s obligations to us  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
the allowance for changes in contracts is an estimate established through reductions to sales while the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate established through charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate quarterly our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions in the united states  canada and spain and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of our assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
we will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
other estimates 
we make a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to volume rebates  litigation  etc 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
results of operations compared to the following table summarizes our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of net revenue for and net revenue gross profit margins earnings before taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted net revenue our net revenue was approximately million for the year ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million for the prior year 
our increase stems from both internal growth and our acquisitions 
the primary reasons for this increase are an exceptional increase in anapharm s revenue to approximately million from million  a material increase in our united states phase i and phase ii revenue  our acquisition of clinical pharmacology in august which provided additional phase i revenue of approximately million  and a full year of operations at anapharm and the kennett square  pa location of sfbc new drug services 
our revenue increased primarily as the result of performing more clinical trials and an increase in the size of our clinical trials 
direct costs direct costs as a percentage of net revenue increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase in our direct costs for december  compared to is primarily attributable to an increase in direct costs in our phase iii business  the inclusion of a full year of phase iii revenue at sfbc new drug services  offset by a reduction in direct costs in our anapharm generic phase i business 
gross profit margins our gross profit margins were in compared to in the largest factor affecting the decrease in our gross profit margins was the decrease in margins in our phase iii business  the inclusion of a full year of operations for sfbc new drug services  offset by an improvement in margins in our generic business at anapharm 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which carry different gross margins  our future gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter  and year to year based upon the mix of these contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects  and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  the amount of gross margins generated might vary due to the unique nature  and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future profit margins and gross profit comparisons to historical levels 
for we anticipate our gross margins will be between and 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses or s  g a expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in total s  g a expenses for both periods is primarily due to the expansion of our business  increased payroll  our increased marketing efforts with an expansion from to sales and marketing people  depreciation expenses consistent with our growth over prior year levels  the inclusion of sfbc new drug services s  g a expenses for all of and the inclusion of clinical pharmacology s s  g a expenses for five months in additionally  we are amortizing approximately  per year over a four year period as the result of issuance of our common stock to two new employees including our senior vice president 
in  we incurred only approximately  of this amortization expense due to the date we entered into the employment agreement with our senior vice president 
the increase in s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenue is primari ly due to the inclusion of anapharm expenses 
as a result of the acquisition of anapharm on march   we expect our s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenue to remain at  or near  current levels 
this is primarily attributable to the nature of anapharm s business where it employs a higher number of research and development employees and incurs higher s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenues than our united states operations 
the canadian government subsidizes a portion of these additional expenses through tax credits 
under united states gaap  these credits are applied against income tax expense rather than against the underlying s  g  a expenses that generated the credit 
the overall impact on our operations is that s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenue will be permanently higher and our effective tax rate will be permanently lower than in the past 
our net income is not changed 
we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of under which management must report and our independent auditor attest on our internal controls 
we expect to fully comply by the december  deadline 
in order to comply  we have retained an independent consulting firm to assist us in evaluating and improving our internal controls 
we expect to incur approximately  in additional costs this year including installation of new accounting software  consulting fees and additional independent auditor fees 
we anticipate incurring most of these expenses in the second and third quarters 
interest expense our interest expense increased in as the result of our borrowings under our credit facility and the acquisition of additional equipment at anapharm 
we used our credit facility to pay an earn out owed to nds  inc in june  provide working capital in june and purchase clinical pharmacology in august we repaid the working capital portion of the loan with cash flow from operations and the balance with proceeds from our november public offering 
we borrowed an additional million on february  to purchase our principal miami facility 
we expect to replace million of the borrowings with a permanent mortgage loan 
anapharm acquires its equipment under capital leases in order to take advantage of favorable canadian tax credits which credits exceed our interest expense 
in  anapharm paid  of interest on capital leases in contrast to  in in  we expect to incur up to  in interest expense primarily as the result of our real estate mortgage and increased equipment purchases by anapharm 
our additional per year interest expense  real estate taxes  occupancy costs and non cash expenses resulting from our purchase of our principal miami facility will be substantially offset by reduced rent expense 
income tax expenses our effective tax rate for was compared to for this in decrease is primarily attributable to i the inclusion of sfbc anapharm s significantly lower tax rate as compared to the united states tax rate for months in compared to nine and one half months in  and ii due to a higher percentage of profits from anapharm as a ratio of consolidated net earnings compared to as described elsewhere in this report  anapharm receives significant tax credits from the government of canada for incurring research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate 
we expect the nature of anapharm s business and the generation of significant tax credits to continue  however  there can be no assurance on the future amount of these credits on a quarterly or annual basis 
our future effective tax rate will be dependent on the amount of the tax credits we receive in connection with our canadian operations and the relative contribution of our canadian operations to our consolidated pre tax income 
if commercially practical  we may refer phase i and phase ii studies and bioanalytical contracts to our canadian operations to benefit from the lower operating costs and lower tax rates in canada  and the availability of tax credits 
excluding the impact of tax credits  our effective tax rate in canada is approximately compared to approximately in the united states 
there will be some practical limitations which prevent us from referring some studies to our canadian operations  including differing areas of expertise  the availability of special population groups or client preferences on where the work should be performed 
earnings per share net earnings increased from approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  an increase of 
on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the  an increase of 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with our secondary offering in november  the issuance of approximately  shares in the clinical pharmacology acquisition in august  the i ncrease in our common stock price and the exercise of approximately  warrants and options during the year 
additionally  the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at december  included only part of the shares we issued to acquire anapharm and nds  inc in excluding any common stock we may issue in connection with future acquisitions  we expect that the fully diluted number of shares outstanding will increase to approximately million 
on july   we announced a common stock buyback plan of up to  shares 
as of december   we had purchased  shares in various open market purchases at an average price of approximately per share  or a total expenditure of approximately  these shares are presented as common stock held in treasury at december  and were retired in february we have not made any additional treasury share purchases since december  we may continue to purchase our shares  or may discontinue the buyback at any time depending on the selling price of our common stock  the viability of potential acquisition targets  and our cash flows from operations and our cash balances 
based upon the share price of per share as february   it is highly unlikely that we will repurchase any of our shares in the immediate future 
we hav e no intent to use any proceeds from our november public offering to repurchase our common stock 
our balance sheet contains an item entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
this has no impact on our income statement and reflects the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar and is calculated on december st 
compared to the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for and net revenue gross profit margins selling  general and administrative expenses earnings before taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted net revenue our net revenue was million for the year ended december   which is an increase of from million for the prior year 
the increase is attributable to i the inclusion in revenue of a full year of operations for our philadelphia bioanalytical laboratory compared to four and one half months in the prior year  ii inclusion of nine and one half months of revenue for our canadian operations compared to zero in the prior year  and iii the inclusion of four months of revenue at our kennett square operations compared to zero in the prior year 
in  both our phase i and phase ii business  and our phase iii business grew over levels 
on a pro forma basis  if we had owned all of our subsidiaries held at december  in both years  net revenue for the year ended december  would have increased ap proximately over the same period in direct costs direct costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the largest factor affecting the decrease in our direct costs was the inclusion of a full year of our philadelphia bioanalytical business operations  which we owned for only four and one half months of and which has lower direct costs as a percentage of net revenue than our other operations taken as a whole 
gross profit margins our gross profit margins increased to in from in the largest factor affecting the increase in our gross profit margins was the inclusion of a full year of higher margin bioanalytical business at our philadelphia operations  which we owned for four and one half months in the increase in gross profit margins was partially offset by the inclusion of nine and one half months of our canadian operations margins in our canadian operations gross profit margins are lower than we have otherwise experienced historically 
selling  general and administrative expenses our s  g a expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
as a percentage of net revenue  our s  g a expenses increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in total s  g a expenses for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  is primarily due to i our increased sales and marketing efforts  ii an increase in bad debt expense  depreciation expense and other expenses consistent with our growth  iii the inclusion of our canadian operations s  g a expenses for nine and one half months in and iv the inclusion of our kennett square operations s  g a expenses for four months in the increase in s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the inclusion of our canadian operations  which have relatively higher s  g a expenses 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the month period ended december  was compared to for the same period in this decrease is primarily attributable to the significantly lower tax rate of our canadian operations as compared to the united states tax rate 
earnings per share net income increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of 
on a fully diluted basis  our net income per share increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased from approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
the increase in the number of shares resulted primarily from the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with our public offering in december  the exercise of approximately  warrants in august  the issuance of approxim ately  shares in connection with the acquisition of our canadian operations in march  the issuance of approximately  shares in the acquisition of our kennett square operations in september  and the exercise of approximately  warrants and options between january  and december  effects of inflation our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in contrast to approximately million of net cash provided by operations in the change is primarily due to the substantial increase in net earnings  depreciation and amortization  offset by a substantial increase in net assets arising from the growth of our business in for  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million compared to approximately million used in investing activities in in  we used approximately million of net cash to acquire clinical pharmacology  synfine  the remaining of danapharm  and to establish sfbc anapharm europe  to purchase of approximately million of property and equipment  and to purchase approximately million in marketable securities 
in  we acquired anapharm and nds  inc for net cash of approximately million and spent approximately million in capital expenditures 
during  net cash of approximately million was provided by financing activities compared to net cash used by financing activities of approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to raising net proceeds of approximately million after all expenses from a secondary offering in november  and the receipt of approximately million from the exercise of stock options in in addition  in we repurchased approximately million of our common stock 
we did not repurchase any common stock in we have a credit facility with wachovia 
in  we modified this credit facility by increasing it to million 
the interest rate on this credit facility is libor based and variable and is currently approximately 
this credit facility enables sfbc to borrow for general working capital purposes and for the purpose of financing acquisitions of companies in related industries 
this credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  the assets of our united states subsidiaries and a stock pledge of of our canadian holding company 
in order to qualify to be able to draw down on the credit facility  we must comply with covenants requiring us to maintain certain leverage and debt service coverage ratios  as well as minimum liquidity 
on february   we borrowed million under our credit facility for the purpose of purchasing the property which comprises our executive offices and principal miami  florida phase i and phase ii clinical trials facility and central laboratory 
as of march   our interest rate on the entire credit facility was approximately 
we expect re pay at least million of the credit facility when we finalize a mortgage loan 
wachovia has issued us a million commitment for this purpose with an estimated fixed rate of approximately per year  which is in addition to our million credit facility 
at march   we had approximately million in cash 
based upon our cash balances and our positive cash flows from operations  we believe we have enough working capital to meet our operational needs within the next months 
we are actively seeking to consummate one or more acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and meets certain operational requirements if we consummate one or more acquisitions  we expect to use our existing cash  our credit facility and  if necessary  obtain additional debt or equity financing 
except for the possibility of issuing stock related to a potential accretive acquisition  should one arise and the commitments noted below  we do not anticipate issuing any of our common stock during we expect to expend approximately million for capital assets consisting primarily of new equipment to create extra capacity and facilities for future growth 
in addition  we expect to spend between to million to renovate the property we purchased in miami last month 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total off balance sheet commitments we may pay nds  inc up to approximately million as an earn out based upon sfbc new drug services future operating results over a two year period commencing october  and ending september  sfbc new drug services did not achieve its operating income milestone for the prior year ended september  this does not include  in guaranteed earn out payable in  installments in and which has already been accrued on our balance sheet 
we have the option to pay part of the earn out  if achieved  with shares of our common stock 
we may pay the stockholders of clinical pharmacology additional merger consideration of up to million per year  subject to a maximum of million over the three years of the earn out period which are the months ended june   and the contingent payments are based upon meeting agreed upon revenue milestones 
if paid  the additional merger consideration will be in equal amounts of cash and sfbc common stock 
based upon business to date  we expect that we will pay million for the month period ended june  this sum will be comprised of one half cash and one half common stock 
related party transactions in march  lisa krinsky  md  our chairman of the board of directors and president  voluntarily prepaid a note due on july  in the amount of  including per annum accrued interest 
the loan represented personal expenses we paid for dr

pro forma disclosure the following table reflects the application of  million for the year ended december  in canadian tax credits  to the costs which generated the credit 
under united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  the tax credits are required to be applied as a credit to income tax expense on our income statement 
as a result  in our financial statements net income before taxes is reduced by the amount of all of the direct costs and s  g a expenses 
under the pro forma approach  we reduce the expenses which generated the credit by the amount of the credit  and increase income tax expense by a corresponding amount 
the end result under the pro forma approach is that our direct costs and s  g a expenses are lower  and our income tax expense is higher 
net income is identical under both the actual and pro forma approaches 
this unaudited pro forma presentation  which is not in conformity with gaap  assists our management in comparing our operating margins and income tax rates to those of other companies in our sector 
for this reason  we believe the pro forma table is useful to investors  but it is presented only for informational purposes and should not be considered as a substitute for our gaap results

the results anticipated by any or all of these forward looking statements might not occur 
important factors  uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements include an unanticipated decision to make an acquisition of a substantially larger competitor  which would require us to re allocate our intended uses of our cash resources  our ability to successfully implement our plans for operational and geographical expansion  our ability to successfully achieve and manage the technical requirements of specialized clinical trial services  while maintaining compliance with applicable rules and regulations  our ability to compete in attracting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in order to develop additional business  our continued ability to recruit participants for clinical st udies and efficiently conduct or manage the studies  the economic climate nationally and internationally as it affects drug development operations and the future research needs of our clients  our ability to integrate and absorb any acquisitions into our current operational structure  the market price of our common stock  and the factors listed below under special factors relating to our business and common stock 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as the result of new information  future events or otherwise 
for more information regarding some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of our business  see the following discussion and our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
special factors relating to our business and common stock our business and common stock are subject to a number of risks including those disclosed below 
we are subject to changes in outsourcing trends in the branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug industries which could adversely affect our operating results 
economic factors and industry trends that affect our primary clients  branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug companies  also affect our business and operating results 
the outsourcing of drug development activities grew substantially during the past decade and we benefited from this trend 
if these industries reduce the outsourcing of their clinical research and other drug development projects  our operations will be adversely affected 
a continuing negative trend could have an ongoing adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
numerous governments have undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and pharmaceutical companies 
if future regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profits which can be derived from new and generic drugs  our clients may reduce their research and development spending  which could reduce the business they outsource to us 
we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these events 
if branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug companies reduce their expenditures  our future revenue and profitability may be reduced 
our business and continued expansion depend on the research and development expenditures of our clients 
if these companies want to reduce costs  they may proceed with fewer clinical trials and other drug development 
an economic downturn or other factors may cause our clients to decrease their research and development expenditures which would adversely affect our future revenue and profitability 
if we do not continue to generate a large number of new client contracts  or if our clients cancel or defer contracts  our future profitability may be adversely affected 
most of our contracts are short term 
as a result  we must continually replace our existing contracts with new contracts to sustain our revenue 
a client s drug development program is the driving force in our ability to initiate new contracts 
in addition  a client may cancel or delay existing contracts at its discretion and is likely to do so if its drug is not ready for testing or if the test results are unsatisfactory 
all of these factors are beyond our control 
our inability to generate new contracts on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  since a large portion of our operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing and progress of contracts can materially affect our results 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations are usually due to the level of new business awards in a particular period and the timing of the initiation  progress  or cancellation of significant projects 
because of our relatively small size and the relatively small number of our shares outstanding  even a short acceleration or delay in such projects can have a material effect on our results in a given reporting period 
historically  our revenue from our united states operations has typically been higher in the second half of the year  although we did not experience any seasonality in we do not know whether our united states business will experience future seasonality 
our varying periodic results may result in the drop of our common stock price if investors react to our reporting operating results which are less favorable than in a prior period or than those anticipated by investors or the financial community generally 
a significant portion of our growth has come from acquisitions  and we plan to make more acquisitions in the future as part of our continuing growth strategy 
this growth strategy subjects us to numerous risks 
a very important aspect of our growth strategy has been and is to pursue strategic acquisitions of related businesses that we believe can expand or compliment our business 
since march  we have substantially grown our business through the completion of eight acquisitions 
acquisitions require significant capital resources and divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct pre dating our acquisition of a business that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
we may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we had anticipated at the time of its purchase 
in addition  acquisitions may create unanticipated tax and accounting problems  including the possib ility that we might be required to write off goodwill which we have paid for in connection with an acquisition 
a key element of our acquisition strategy has been to retain management of acquired businesses to operate the acquired business for us 
many of these individuals maintain important contacts with clients of the acquired business 
our inability to retain these individuals could materially impair the value of an acquired business 
our failure to successfully accomplish future acquisitions or to manage and integrate completed or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  we can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  we can successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of any acquired business  or we will be able to retain an acquired company s significant client relationships  goodwill and key personnel or otherwise realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
we have grown rapidly over the last few years  and our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on us 
we have grown rapidly over the last several years  including through acquisitions 
businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth 
our rapid growth has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management  on our accounting  financial  information and other systems and on our business 
although we have expanded our management  we need to continue recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support 
in addition  we will need to continue to improve our financial  accounting  information and other systems in order to effectively manage our growth 
historically  when making acquisitions we have targeted operations that we believe can be operated as autonomous business units and we have not transitioned acquired businesses to a common financial  accounting or information systems p latform 
this decentralization of our operations and systems may create difficulties for us in the future 
we expect that all of our north american subsidiaries will be using common accounting software this year 
although our management believes that our internal controls are effective  in connection with past audits most recently the audit for the year ended december   grant thornton llp  our independent certified public accountants  notified our management and audit committee of the existence of significant deficiencies in internal controls  which is an accounting term for internal control deficiencies that  in the judgment of our independent certified public accountants  are significant 
although grant thornton did not conclude that the reportable conditions  either individually or in the aggregate  constituted a material weakness in our internal controls  if we do not effectively execute our plans to strengthen our internal controls  including plans to prepare us to comply with the new annual internal control certification that will be required pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related sec rules  our auditors in the future could find such a weakness in our internal controls 
we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully  or that our financial  accounting  information or other systems will be able to successfully accommodate our growth 
our failure to meet these challenges could materially impair our business 
we have substantial non us operations  which exposes us to currency risks 
approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  was derived from our canadian operations 
in addition  we own a interest in a joint venture which operates a bioanalytical laboratory in barcelona  spain and provide services to the european market 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar or other foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
we also may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when our service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which we incur expenses or earn fees related to such contracts 
for example  our canadian operations often perform services fo r a fixed price denominated in us dollars or in euros while their payroll and other expenses are primarily canadian dollar expenses 
to date we have not hedged our canadian dollar or euro translation or transaction risks with foreign currency forward or exchange contracts or options 
we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada 
our operations in canada currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements 
we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments 
our canadian operations employ a high number of research and development employees which results in significant expenses related to these services 
due to the nature of these services  the canadian government subsidizes a portion of these expenses through tax credits that result in a reduced effective tax rate as well as a significant deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
however  there is no assurance that the credits will be fully realized 
any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits could have a material adverse effect on our profits and cash flow from our canadian operations 
if we are required to write off goodwill or other intangible assets  our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
as of december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million  which constituted about of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
at any given time  one or a limited number of clients may account for a large percentage of our revenue  which means that we face a greater risk of loss of revenue if we lose a major client 
historically  a small number of clients have generated a large percentage of our revenue in any given period 
in each of and  no client provided more than of our revenue  but our largest clients provided approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
in  one client represented about of our revenue 
companies that constitute our largest clients vary from year to year  and our revenue from individual clients fluctuates each year 
if we lose one or more major clients  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our clients may in any given period cancel or delay their contracts or clinical trials  which could reduce or delay our revenue and result in operating losses 
our clients may cancel or delay their contracts with us at any time for no reason 
they also may cancel or delay a clinical trial for a variety of reasons  including manufacturing problems resulting in a shortage or unavailability of the drug we are testing  a decision by a client to de emphasize or cancel the development of a drug  unexpected clinical trial results  adverse participant reaction to a drug  an action by regulatory authorities in the united states  the fda  and in canada  the tpd  and inadequate participant enrollment 
the loss or delay of a large project or contract or the loss or delay of multiple smaller contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and future results of operations 
if we lose the services of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified staff  our business could be adversely affected 
our success is substantially dependent upon the performance  contributions and expertise of our senior management team  including  among others  lisa krinsky  md  arnold hantman  md  gregory b 
holmes  md  marc lebel  pharmd  gary ingenito  pharmd and pharmd and allan xu  pharmd in addition  members of our senior management team play a very significant role in the generation of new business and retention of existing clients 
we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management  professional and operating staff 
our loss of the services of any of the members of senior management  or any other key executive  or our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we are significantly smaller than our largest competitors  we may lack the financial resources needed to compete effectively 
there are a large number of drug development services companies ranging in size from one person firms to full service  global drug development corporations 
it is relatively easy for a new company to enter our industry 
intense competition may lead to price pressure or other conditions that could adversely affect our business 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater resources 
we may lack the operating and financial resources needed to compete effectively 
we risk potential liability when conducting clinical trials  which could cost us large amounts of money 
our clinical trials involve administering drugs to humans in order to determine the effects of the drugs 
by doing so  we are subject to the general risks of liability to these persons  which include those relating to adverse side effects and reactions resulting from administering these drugs to a clinical trial participant  improper administration of these drugs  or potential professional malpractice of our employees or contractors  including physicians 
our contracts may not have adequate indemnification agreements requiring our clients to indemnify us in the event of adverse consequences to our participants caused by their drugs 
we also carry liability insurance but there is no certainty as to the adequacy  or the continued availability at rates acceptable to us  of such liability insurance 
we could also be held liable for other errors or omissions in connection with our services 
for example  we could be held liable for errors or omissions or breach of contract if our laboratories inaccurately report or fail to report lab results 
if we do not perform our services to contractual or regulatory standards  the clinical trial process could be adversely affected 
additionally  if clinical trial services such as laboratory analysis do not conform to contractual or regulatory standards  trial participants could be affected 
if there is a damage claim not covered by insurance  the indemnification agreement is not enforceable or broad enough  or our client is insolvent  any resulting award against us could result in our experiencing large losses 
we face a risk of liability from our handling and disposal of medical wastes  which could cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect us 
our clinical trial activities and laboratory services involve the controlled disposal of medical wastes  which are considered hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if this occurs  we could be held liable for clean up costs  damages  face significant fines  and face the temporary or permanent shutdown of our operations 
if we do not continue to develop new scientific methods  or assays  for our analytical applications  we may be unable to compete with other entities offering bioanalytical laboratory services 
we must continuously develop scientific methods to test drug products in order to meet the needs of our clients and attract new clients 
in order to substantially increase the business of our bioanalytical laboratories  which provide services for branded pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and generic drug companies  we must be able to provide solutions for our clients 
this requires staying abreast of current regulatory requirements and identifying methods and applications that will assist our clients in obtaining approval for their products 
if we are not successful in developing new methods and applications  we may lose our clients 
relaxation of government regulation could decrease the need for the services we provide 
governmental agencies throughout the world  but particularly in the united states and canada  highly regulate the drug development approval process 
part of our business involves helping branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug companies through the regulatory drug approval process 
any relaxation in regulatory approval standards could substantially reduce the need for our services  and  as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
potential regulatory changes under consideration in the united states and elsewhere include mandatory substitution of generic drugs for innovator drugs  relaxation in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures  some of which already exist in canada 
these and other changes in regulation could have an impact on the business op portunities available to us 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could harm our operating results and reputation 
we may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
failure to comply can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials 
this could harm our reputation  our prospects for future work and our operating results 
a finding by the fda that we are not in compliance with glp standards for our laboratories  current gmp standards  and or gcp standards for our clinical facilities could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  we must comply with state laws governing clinical trials 
for example  if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from participants in connection with a particular clinical trial  the data collected from that trial could be disqualified  and we could be required to redo the trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our clients  but at substantial cost to us 
such an event could also damage our reputation and could cause future harm to our operating results 
if we are unable to submit electronic records to the fda according to fda regulations  our ability to perform services for our customers which meet applicable regulatory requirements could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to submit electronic records to the fda which meet the requirements of fda regulations  this may adversely affect our customers when they submit the data concerned to the fda in support of an application for approval of a product 
the fda published cfr part electronic records  electronic signatures  final rule  known as part  in part became effective in august and defines the regulatory requirements that must be met for fda acceptance of electronic records and or electronic signatures in place of the paper equivalents 
part requires that those utilizing such electronic records and or signatures employ procedures and controls designed to ensure the authenticity  integrity and  as appropriate  confidentiality of electronic records and  part requires those utilizing electronic signatures to ensure that a person appending an electronic signature cannot readily repudiate the signed record 
pharmaceutical  medical device and biotechnology companies are increasing their utilization of electronic records and electronic sig natures and are requiring their service providers and partners to do likewise 
becoming compliant with part involves considerable complexity and cost 
our ability to provide services to our clients in full compliance with applicable regulations includes a requirement that  over time  we become compliant and maintain compliance with the requirements of part if we are unable to achieve this objective  our ability to provide services to our customers which meet fda requirements may be adversely affected 
we may bear financial risk if we under price our contracts or overrun cost estimates 
since our contracts are often structured as fixed price  we bear the financial risk if we initially under price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates 
such under pricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is performing well 
our stock price may be depressed by future sales of our shares or the perception that such sales may occur 
we had  shares outstanding as of march   of which  are subject to limitations on resale under sec rule almost all of our remaining outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable  including shares that were issued in connection with past acquisitions and that have been registered for resale with the sec 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by these holders might lower our common stock s market price 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of our outstanding common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult  which could depress our stock price 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
our charter documents provide that our board of directors may issue  without a vote of our stockholders  one or more series of preferred stock that has more than one vote per share 
this could permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management 
additionally  issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in the price of our common stock and a decline in interest in the stock  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is performing well 
our bylaws also limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
in addition  provisions of certain contracts  such as employment agreements with our executive officers  may have an anti takeover effect 
our stock price can be extremely volatile  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to be  volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  including changes in our guidance as to forecasted earnings  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  loss of a major client  new service offerings introduced or announced by our competitors  changes in market valuations of other similar companies  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our common stock  including short sales 
as a result  you could lose all or part of your investment 
in addition  the stock market in general experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of companies
