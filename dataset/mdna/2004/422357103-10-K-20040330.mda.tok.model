item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors real estate investment risks  general economic conditions affecting real estate industry the company faces risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where the company owns properties 
these risks include  but are not limited to liability for environmental hazards  changes in general or local economic conditions  changes in real estate and zoning laws  changes in income taxes  real estate taxes  or federal or local taxes  floods  earthquakes  and other acts of nature  and other factors beyond the company s control 
the illiquidity of real estate investments generally may impair the company s ability to respond promptly to changing circumstances 
the inability of management to respond promptly to changing circumstances could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to make distributions to the unitholders 
the real estate industry generally is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in national  global and local economic conditions and events  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  consumer confidence and the demand for housing and other types of construction 
sellers of real estate are subject to various risks  many of which are outside the control of the seller  including real estate market conditions  changing demographic conditions  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as hurricanes and tornadoes  changes in government regulations or requirements and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of heartland 
environmental liabilities under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances  and regulations  the owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances located on or in  or emanating from  such property  as well as costs of investigation and property damages 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner or operator s ability to sell or lease a property or borrow using the property as collateral 
other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks 
noncompliance with these and other environmental  health or safety requirements may result in substantial costs to us or may result in the need to cease or alter operations on the property and may reduce the value of the property or our ability to sell it 
environmental laws may impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed on  or released from  the property 
a conveyance of the property  therefore  does not relieve the owner or operator from liability 
the company cannot assure that environmental liability claims will not arise in the future 
heartland is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment  including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites 
heartland is in the process of assessing its environmental exposure  including obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties 
because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on its properties  the potential exists for remediation costs to be materially different from the costs heartland has estimated 
some of the property owned by the company consists of land formerly used for railroad 
other properties were leased to tenants that used hazardous materials in their businesses 
any contamination of that property may affect adversely the company s ability to sell such property 
notes receivable from hti as discussed in item business notes receivable from hti  hti owes heartland  in the aggregate  approximately  under the notes and the pg oldco notes  both of which are secured by the class b interest 
heartland has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  related thereto 
upon either the acquisition of the class b interest pursuant to a proposed settlement agreement or the foreclosure on the class b interest  the receivable amount in respect of the notes and the pg oldco notes reflected in the due from affiliate account will be reduced to zero  and the class b interest and the class b interest s capital account balance will be cancelled 
if cancelled  the class b interest will no longer be entitled to receive any distributions of cash or other property from heartland 
although heartland s management believes it is unlikely  there can be no assurance that either the settlement agreement will be approved by hti s stockholders or that heartland will be able to foreclose on the class b interest 
if the class b interest is not foreclosed  it will be entitled to distributions under the terms of the partnership agreement 
pending litigation the jacobson litigation described in item legal proceedings may not be resolved in the company s favor  and the company may incur significant costs associated therewith 
if the company is required to pay substantial enough amounts with respect to the jacobson litigation  the company may not be left with any cash or other property to distribute to the unitholders 
access to financing as of december   heartland s total consolidated indebtedness was zero 
there can be no assurance that the amounts available from internally generated funds  cash on hand and sale of assets will be sufficient to fund heartland s anticipated operations 
heartland may be required to seek additional capital in the form of bank financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to heartland 
if heartland is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund the implementation of its liquidation strategy and for other expenditures  properties might be sold for far less than their value 
any such discounted sale could adversely affect heartland s future results of operations and future cash flows 
however  management does not have any intention to discount the sale of properties for far less than their value 
period to period fluctuations heartland s sales activity varies from period to period  and the ultimate success of this sales activity cannot always be determined from results in any particular period or periods 
thus  the timing and amount of revenues arising from this sales activity are subject to considerable uncertainty 
the inability of heartland to manage effectively their cash flows from operations would have an adverse effect on their ability to service any future debt  and to meet working capital requirements 
liquidation of assets the company s management expects to sell to unrelated third parties the remainder of its properties 
the unitholders will not have control over the divestiture of the company s remaining assets or  if the partnership is dissolved  the liquidation process 
the company cannot make any assurance that changes in its policies will serve fully the interests of all unitholders or that the unitholders will receive any liquidating distributions of cash or other property 
risks related to the class a units the market value of the class a units could decrease based on the company s performance  market perception and conditions 
the market value of the class a units may be based primarily upon the market s perception of the company s growth potential and current and future cash distributions  and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the company s underlying assets 
the market price of the class a units may be influenced by the distributions on the class a units relative to market interest rates 
rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of the class a units to expect a higher distribution rate  which would adversely affect the market price of the class a units 
in addition  if the company were to borrow  rising interest rates could result in increased expense  thereby adversely affecting the cash flow and the company s ability to service its indebtedness and make distributions 
the class a units have been traded since june  the company believes that factors such as but not limited to announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s quarterly or annual operating results  failure to meet expectations  and general economic conditions  could cause the price of the company s units to fluctuate substantially 
in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the class a units 
the class a units are currently traded on the american stock exchange under the symbol htl 
the class a units are thinly traded 
there are no assurances that the company will maintain its listing on the exchange 
if the class a units should be delisted from the exchange  it is likely that it could materially and or adversely effect any future liquidity in the class a units 
summary of significant accounting estimates the company s most significant accounting estimates relate to potential environmental liabilities  the jacobson litigation and the treatment of certain loans from heartland to the general partner 
potential environmental liabilities heartland evaluates environmental liabilities associated with its properties on a regular basis 
an allowance is provided with regard to potential environmental liabilities  including remediation  legal and consulting fees  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of any liability is evaluated independently from any claim the company may have for recovery 
if the amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated but management is able to determine that the amount of the liability is likely to fall within a range  and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate  then an allowance in the minimum amount of the range is established 
if the company were to use a different approach  the reserve could be materially higher 
by reserving at the low end of possible results  it is likely that the actual costs of environmental claims will be higher than the reserve on the company s books  because it is unlikely that  as a whole  the claims will be less expensive to resolve than the low end of the range  and more likely that the claims will cost more than the best case amount 
also  the company does not reserve any amounts for unknown claims 
this means that as new claims arise additional reserves will need to be added 
estimates can be affected by various uncertainties including future changes in technology  changes in regulations or requirements of local governmental authorities  third party claims  the scope and cost to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that may be shared and the timing of the remediation work 
environmental costs that are incurred in connection with heartland s development activities are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
in the event the company believes a third party was responsible for the contamination  it attempts to have that third party assume the responsibility for the costs of cleaning up the site 
sometimes there are funds available from state programs for clean up 
these funds can be available for contamination resulting from railroad operations as well as those from third parties 
the company seeks these funds when they are available 
potential recoveries from third parties or government programs are not considered in the environmental reserve 
at december   heartland s allowance for environmental claims and liabilities was approximately  significant matters related to the company s reserve for environmental claims are discussed below 
under environmental laws  liability for hazardous substance contamination is imposed on the current owners and operators of the contaminated site  as well as the owner or the operator of the site at the time the hazardous substance was disposed or otherwise released 
in most cases  this liability is imposed without regard to fault 
currently  the company has known environmental liabilities associated with certain of its properties arising out of the activities of its predecessor or certain of its predecessor s lessees and may have further material environmental liabilities as yet unknown 
the majority of the company s known environmental liabilities stem from the use of petroleum products  such as motor oil and diesel fuel  in the operation of a railroad or in operations conducted by its predecessor s lessees 
from time to time contaminants are discovered on property the company now owns 
some of these may have resulted from the historical activities of the milwaukee road railroad 
in other cases the property was leased to a tenant who released contaminants onto the property 
the company s property may also be polluted by a release or migration of contaminants onto the company s property by unrelated third parties 
the company has not investigated all of its properties and does not know how many of them may be contaminated 
the company s practice when it sells land is to sell the property as is  where is without any representation or indemnification for environmental conditions  however  the company has one active site  miles city  montana  where it has agreed to indemnify the buyer for known environmental concerns 
there are other cases in which the company has had a claim arising out of alleged contamination on sold property 
in some  but not all  of these instances  the company has been successful in asserting the bar arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings of the milwaukee road railroad 
the company may be responsible for certain liabilities that arise from the historical operations of the milwaukee road railroad that have nothing to do with the ownership of property 
the company has been  for example  named as a potentially liable party in a number of landfill clean up cases in which there is an allegation that the milwaukee road railroad sent materials to the landfill 
additional claims may arise in the future 
in some  but not all  of these cases  the company has been successful in asserting the bar arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings of the milwaukee road railroad 
the montana department of environmental quality deq has asserted that the company is liable for some or all of the investigation and remediation of certain properties in montana sold by its predecessor s reorganization trustee prior to the consummation of its predecessor s reorganization 
the company has denied liability at certain of these sites based on the reorganization bar of the company s predecessor 
the company s potential liability for the investigation and remediation of these sites was discussed in detail at a meeting with deq in april while deq has not formally changed its position  deq has not elected to file suit 
since the company cannot determine if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any potential liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the company s management is not able to express an opinion at this time whether the cost of the defense of this liability or the environmental exposure in the event of the company s liability will or will not be material 
at four separate sites  the company has been notified that releases arising out of the operations of a lessee  former lessee or other third party have been reported to government agencies 
at each of these sites  the third party is voluntarily cooperating with the appropriate agency by investigating the extent of any such contamination and performing the appropriate remediation  if any 
cmc owns a acre site in minneapolis  minnesota that is impacted with arsenic and lead 
the company filed suit against us borax on july   in the united states district court for the district of minnesota for contribution 
us borax is a former operator of a pesticide herbicide facility on the property  its operations were discontinued in the matter has been stayed pending agreement between the parties and the minnesota department of agriculture mda on the appropriate remediation for the site 
subject to a public comment period  on march   the mda approved a response action plan for the property owned by cmc 
at december   heartland s aggregate allowance for claims and liabilities for this site is  the company has also been informed that the united states environmental protection agency is considering a cleanup of arsenic soils in a nearby residential neighborhood and may seek to recover cost of the cleanup from cmc 
the canadian pacific railroad  formerly known as the soo line railroad company  has asserted that the company is liable for  among other things  the remediation of releases of petroleum or other regulated materials at six different sites located in iowa  minnesota and wisconsin that canadian pacific acquired from the company 
the company has denied liability based on the underlying asset purchase agreement 
the environmental claims are all currently being handled by canadian pacific  and the company understands that canadian pacific has paid settlements on certain of these claims 
because canadian pacific has been handling these matters exclusively  the company has made no determination as to the merits of the claims and is unable to determine their materiality 
in november  the company settled a claim with respect to the so called wheeler pit site near janesville  wisconsin 
the company s only outstanding obligation under the settlement is to pay of the monitoring costs for twenty five years beginning in at december   heartland s allowance for claims and liabilities for this site is  in addition to the environmental matters set forth above  there may be other properties with environmental liabilities not yet known to the company  with potential environmental liabilities for which the company has no reasonable basis to estimate  or for which the company believes it is not reasonably likely to ultimately bear responsibility for the liability but the investigation or remediation of which may require future expenditures 
management is not able to express an opinion at this time whether the environmental expenditures for these properties will or will not be material 
the company has given notice to insurers  which issued policies to the milwaukee road railroad of certain of the company s environmental liabilities 
due to the high deductibles on these policies  the company has not yet demanded that any insurer indemnify or defend the company 
consequently  management has not formed an opinion regarding the legal sufficiency of the company s claims for insurance coverage 
in the event the company is dissolved  the company will have to make a provision for its potential environmental liabilities 
it will have to provide for known liabilities and also for those likely to arise or become known within ten years after the date of dissolution 
the company s management believes it may be in the best interests of the company to purchase environmental insurance or contract with a third party to assume the company s environmental liabilities if it appears that the cost to do so will be less than maintaining the company s overhead to resolve these liabilities going forward 
the company has hired an insurance consultant and broker to help determine the best alternative to provide for these potential liabilities 
the cost of any transfer of environmental liabilities and insurance policy is likely to be greater than the amount of the reserve  and the cost of such transfer and insurance is not reflected in the environmental reserve 
treatment of certain loans from hti to heartland as of december   hti owes heartland and cmc an aggregate of  under promissory notes issued in december the notes 
the notes are collateralized by a security interest in the class b interest the collateral and bear interest at per annum 
the company also received as additional consideration for the notes a series c warrant that entitles heartland to purchase  shares of hti common stock at an exercise price of per share 
hti s stock was trading in the over the counter market after its delisting from the american stock exchange at less than per share as of december  on february   the company and cmc demanded immediate payment in full of all obligations due under the notes from hti 
pg oldco  inc  a creditor of hti under notes in an aggregate principal amount of  pg oldco notes  also had a security interest in the collateral and had commenced steps to protect its interest 
under a lien subordination and inter creditor agreement inter creditor agreement by and among heartland  cmc  pg oldco  inc and hti  heartland and cmc had a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof up to the senior debt priority amount as defined in the inter creditor agreement 
pg oldco  inc had a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof for all amounts in excess of the senior debt priority amount 
on may  heartland purchased from pg oldco  inc the pg oldco notes for approximately  the purchase price consisted of  in cash paid on may  and a note payable for  due october  this note and accrued interest were paid in full on october  the purchase price of  for the pg oldco notes was recorded as an increase in due from affiliate on the company s financial statements 
at december   hti owes heartland and cmc  in the aggregate  approximately  heartland has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  on the notes and pg oldco notes receivable balance of  heartland has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts against the notes and pg olco notes because hti has indicated to heartland that it does not have the means to repay the amounts owed under the notes and pg oldco notes 
the  allowance for doubtful accounts that was recorded in the fourth quarter of was a result of the company s closing the sale of its fife  washington property at a price of  and then distributing a unit in december which reduced the estimated amount of potential future distributions distributable to the class b interest 
because heartland intends to acquire the class b interest from hti either pursuant to a proposed settlement agreement between hti and certain of its creditors or upon a foreclosure of the class b interest  as discussed below  heartland has determined that the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts should reflect the value of the class b interest based on the estimated amount of potential future cash distributions distributable in respect of the class b interest upon a liquidation of heartland assuming that the class b interest is not cancelled and remains outstanding 
such estimated potential distributions were based on a variety of assumptions made by heartland s management 
if a proposed settlement agreement is entered into among all of hti s creditors with the exception of heartland and edwin jacobson and is approved by hti s stockholders  heartland will acquire the class b interest from hti in exchange for a release of hti s obligations under the notes and pg oldco notes 
in the event that the proposed settlement agreement is not approved by hti s stockholders  heartland anticipates that it will exercise its rights under the notes  the pg oldco notes  the related security agreements and applicable law to foreclose on the class b interest 
upon either the acquisition of the class b interest pursuant to the proposed settlement agreement or the foreclosure on the class b interest  the receivable amount in respect of the notes and the pg oldco notes reflected in the due from affiliate account will be reduced to zero  and the class b interest and the class b interest s capital account balance will be cancelled 
if cancelled  the class b interest will no longer be entitled to receive any distributions of cash or other property from heartland 
although heartland s management believes it is unlikely  there can be no assurance that either the settlement agreement will be approved by hti s stockholders or that heartland will be able to foreclose on the class b interest 
if the class b interest is not foreclosed  it will be entitled to distributions under the terms of the partnership agreement 
jacobson litigation edwin jacobson  the former president and ceo of cmc  has sued the company claiming that it owes him additional salary and incentive compensation based on the terms of his employment contract 
he has demanded   salary and  incentive compensation in damages 
the company has denied mr 
jacobson s claims and has countersued to recover past payments made to him and to collect  in principal and interest under a note jacobson made to the company 
this matter is explained in greater detail in item legal proceedings 
the company offered to settle the lawsuits in exchange for forgiving jacobson s debt to the company 
when it made the offer  the company wrote the debt off its books 
cmc has made no other provision for this potential liability 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in more detail in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of critical accounting policies that require management estimates and judgements 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of accounts receivable and notes receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible 
accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  due from affiliate on the consolidated balance sheets are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  residential sales were recognized at closing when title to the home passed to the buyer 
the company s homes were generally offered for sale in advance of their construction

heartland evaluates environmental liabilities associated with its properties on a regular basis 
an allowance is provided with regard to potential environmental liabilities  including remediation  legal and consulting fees  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of any liability is evaluated independently from any claim the company may have for recovery 
if the amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated but management is able to determine that the amount of the liability is likely to fall within a range  and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate  then an allowance in the minimum amount of the range is established 
properties held for development  including capitalized predevelopment costs  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a condemnation proceeding being brought by a governmental agency against the company or the discovery of an environmental liability related to a particular site  indicate that the carrying amount of the particular development property may not be recoverable 
if these events or changes in circumstances are present  the company estimates the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted to result from the development operations and eventual disposition of the particular development property  and if less than the carrying amount of the development property  the company will recognize an impairment loss based on discounted cash flows 
upon recognition of any impairment loss  the company would measure that loss based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
no event occurred during the years  and that resulted in an impairment loss being recognized 
for properties held for sale  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property 
no event occurred during the years and that resulted in an impairment loss being recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  an impairment loss of  was recognized as a component of cost of sales on kinzie station phase ii as the company was able to quantify the costs associated with the disposal of the property
