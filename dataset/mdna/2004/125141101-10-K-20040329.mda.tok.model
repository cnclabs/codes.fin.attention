item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations operations overview we operate as a provider of air pollution control products and services marketed under the kirk blum  ceco filters  busch international  ceco abatement systems  kbd technic and k b duct trade names 
our business is focused on engineering  designing  and building equipment  and installing systems that capture  clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities 
we have a diversified base of more than  active customers among a myriad of industries including aerospace  brick  cement  ceramics  metalworking  printing  paper  food  foundries  metal plating  woodworking  chemicals  tobacco  glass  automotive  and pharmaceuticals 
therefore  our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer 
we operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management  finance  administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes 
we use this model throughout our operations 
this has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model 
we have expanded our business by adding ceco abatement systems and k b duct while divesting of the operating assets of air purator corporation in and busch martec in neither were strategically important to us 
however  our sales have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn especially in the capital goods segment 
as a result  we have made reductions in our operating cost structure to help mitigate the impact 
much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories 
favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and construction of new industrial sites 
economic expansion provides us with the potential to increase and accelerate levels of growth 
however  as we have seen in the past two years  in a weak economy customers tend to lengthen the time between inquiry and order or may defer purchases 
we have made significant strides in reducing our leverage through cash generated by operations and asset sales  which has reduced our debt carrying costs 
we ended with senior debt of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december results of operations our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and reflect our operations consolidated with the operations of our subsidiaries 
vs 
for the year ended december  s in millions sales cost of sales gross profit excluding depreciation percent of sales selling and administrative expenses percent of sales operating income percent of sales consolidated sales were million  a decrease of million compared to our small order business remained relatively constant with in  these orders totaled million compared to million in these orders came from our large base of customers that are generally repeat buyers for replacement products  for service work or for custom fabrication work 
in  the individual larger contracts were down because of the continuing weakness in the us economy 
additionally  sales were higher resulting from the following a several large projects included in our december  backlog that were completed in including work performed for ethanol processing facilities and a specialty textile manufacturer  and b sales generated by large orders booked in including work performed for a large testing facility  a cement manufacturing facility and a major automotive manufacturer 
net sales during the year ended december  included  revenue generated from operations divested in orders booked in were million compared with million in the decline in bookings was due to the weakness in the economy coupled with several large orders booked in that were not replaced with comparably sized orders in including orders booked for a rockwool insulation manufacturing plant  a large testing facility  a cement manufacturing facility and for a major automotive manufacturer 
we have experienced an increased level of customer inquiry and quoting activities in the later half of relative to the first half of this may be partially attributable to a perceived improvement in the economy by our customers  which could result in increased air quality related capital spending 
this favorable trend could lead to an increase in our future sales 
gross profit excluding depreciation was million in compared with million in gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in compared to in the slight decline was due to our product mix and higher margins realized in our contracting operations coupled with lower factory overhead costs 
we managed our fixed overhead costs to help offset some of the lost gross profit from reduced sales in a highly competitive market in as a result  gross margin was relatively stable in compared to selling and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for were compared to in in light of the lower revenue in and weakness in the economy  we implemented cost reduction initiatives in may  september and may  which generated an annualized operating cost savings of approximately  these cost savings  which are primarily due to a reduction in our workforce  and our cost containment efforts  were the principal reasons for the decrease in selling and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in year ended december  operating income was  in and  in the impact on operating income from the lower sales was significantly lessened by our operating expense reductions 
we reduced selling and administrative expenses by  principally due to cost reduction programs implemented in and additionally  depreciation and amortization expense was lower by  resulting from our initiatives to control capital expenditures 
these expense reductions and cost containment initiatives  as well as lower factory overhead spending  helped to mitigate the reduction in operating income due to lower sales 
other income for the year ended december  was million compared with income of million during the same period of the other income for the year ended december  is the result of the gain recognized from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property 
a deferred gain of  will be recognized over the ensuing three year leaseback period 
the other income during the year ended december  is the result of a fair market value adjustment to a liability recorded in connection with detachable stock warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
these warrants were issued along with the company s stock issuance of  shares of common stock on december  to a group of private investors 
this liability is accounted for at fair market value and adjustments in future quarters could result in an increase to the liability and a corresponding charge to income 
interest expense decreased million to million during compared to the same period of the decrease is due to lower debt outstanding during the year partially offset by higher interest rates 
federal and state income tax benefit was million during compared with a tax benefit of million for the same period in the effective income tax rate for was compared with in the same period of the effective tax rate during was favorably affected by state tax benefits and exports sales and negatively affected by certain permanent differences including non deductible interest expense 
net loss was  in and  in the impact on net loss from lower operating income was partially offset by reduced tax effected interest expense 
as a result  we increased our net loss in by  vs 
for the year ended december  s in millions sales cost of sales gross profit excluding depreciation percent of sales selling and administrative expenses percent of sales operating income percent of sales consolidated net sales decreased  or million to million from to sales were down mainly because of a the weakness in the industrial segment of the us economy  b divestitures of two non core businesses  air purator corporation and busch martec that amounted to million of decreased sales  and c the abandonment of our expansion into the highly engineered specialty piping for automotive paint facilities started in  which amounted to million of decreased sales 
one of our targeted growth areas  thermal oxidation technology  sold under the ceco abatement trade name  had a strong first full year of operations  by generating over million of orders from alternative energy providers 
sales of our fiberbed mist eliminator technology  continued to penetrate further into automotive component manufacturers 
we began with a strong backlog of million 
orders booked in were million compared with million in the decline resulted primarily from a reduction in large orders from automotive manufacturers and from the metals industries 
however  smaller orders from customers who represent a cross section of industrial customers in the united states also decreased 
in december  we sold the fixed assets and inventory of air purator corp 
apc and received notes totaling  the notes  which were due primarily in march  were secured by the assets of apc 
at december   we deferred the gain on sale of  until collection was reasonably assured 
however  the purchaser defaulted on the loan  and we commenced foreclosure proceedings in may we subsequently sold the assets to the former general manager of apc on july  and recognized a gain on sale during the third and fourth quarters of totaling  the net assets and operations of apc were not material to our consolidated operations 
we also sold the assets of busch martec during because those assets no longer served our vision for future operations 
busch martec s assets are insignificant to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit excluding depreciation was million in compared with million in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared with in even though we a increased margins in on turnkey projects through improved project management and b reduced factory overhead in  the decline in sales caused a net decrease in margin 
gross profit in also includes the favorable impact of a recovery of a claim from a contract and the impact from the sale of apc operating assets 
selling and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for were compared to in the decrease is due to cost control and reductions in our workforce 
we reduced our workforce in may and again in september reflecting the consolidation of certain functions  efficiencies and lower sales volume 
on an annualized basis  the full impact on cost control initiatives is expected to result in a savings of approximately million  which began to be realized during the third quarter of the period included certain non recurring adjustments of  related to a customer bankruptcy and other contingencies  which reduced selling and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in the year ended december  primarily resulting from the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets with finite lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
operating income was  in and  in the impact on operating income from the lower sales was lessened by our operating expense reductions and cessation of amortization on goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
we reduced selling and administrative expenses by  principally due to cost reduction programs implemented in the decrease would have been  higher had it not been for non recurring adjustments relating to a customer bankruptcy of  and other contingencies  which reduced selling and administrative expenses in additionally  depreciation and amortization expense was lower by  primarily due to the cessation of amortization discussed above 
these expense reductions and lower factory overhead spending helped to mitigate some of the reduction in gross profit due to lower sales 
other income for the year ended december  was million compared with income of million during the same period of the other income in is the result of a fair market value adjustment during the second quarter to a liability recorded in connection with the issuance of warrants 
warrants were issued along with our issuance of  shares of common stock on december  to certain of our investors 
this liability is accounted for at fair market value and adjustments in future quarters could result in an increase to the liability and a corresponding charge in income 
interest expense decreased million to million during compared to the same period of the decrease is principally due to lower borrowing levels and decreased rates under the bank credit facility 
federal and state income tax benefit was million during compared with a tax provision of million for the same period in the effective income tax rate for was compared with in the same period of the effective tax rate during is affected by state tax benefits and by certain permanent differences including non deductible interest expense 
the effective income tax rate during was affected by non deductible goodwill amortization and interest expense 
net loss was  in and  in the impact on net loss from lower operating income was partially offset by reduced interest expense and an increase from income tax benefits 
as a result  we reduced our net loss in by  liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  and  respectively 
generally  we do not carry significant cash and cash equivalent balances because excess amounts are used to pay down our revolving line of credit 
total bank and related debt as of december  was  as compared to  at december   a decrease of  due to net payments under the bank credit facilities 
the cash that we used to pay down our debt came from our conshohocken property transaction discussed below  subordinated debt raised discussed below and the balance came from cash generated by operating activities 
unused credit availability under our revolving line of credit at december  was  the bank credit facility was amended in november by extending the maturities of the revolving line of credit and the final payment due under the term loan to january no extinguishment loss was recognized as a result of this amendment 
the amendment also reduced minimum coverage requirements under several financial covenants through december  we opted to amend the existing agreement rather than refinance the entire credit facility as discussed in the second quarter of because of current market conditions 
however  we will continue to monitor such market conditions and will seek refinancing alternatives in future periods 
on september    of subordinated debt was raised from a related party with a maturity of april  and interest rate of per annum 
this debt is subordinated to the bank credit facility and the subordinated debt originally issued in december the entire principal balance of this obligation will be due upon maturity 
proceeds were used to reduce the revolving line of credit 
overview of cash flows and liquidity for the year ended december s in thousands total operating cash flow purchases of property and equipment divestiture of businesses and other proceeds from sale of property net cash provided used in investing activities proceeds from issuance of common stock and detachable warrants stock issuance expense repayments of borrowings  net proceeds from subordinated notes other uses net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in   was generated from operating activities 
this follows two years of higher amounts of cash generation  which were mainly due to increased sales volumes and reductions in working capital during and in  cash provided was impacted by our net loss adjusted for non cash items and lessened working capital demands from lower sales 
we generated additional cash through a decrease in accounts receivable of  that was due to lower sales and offset by slower turnover of our accounts receivable 
a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from reduced purchases on lower sales volume used cash of  the other working capital account that generated cash was inventory 
other working capital accounts that used cash were prepaid expenses and other current assets  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
our net investment in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of debt at december  was  as compared to  at december  looking forward  we will continue to manage our net investment in working capital 
we believe that our working capital needs will tend to change at a lower rate than the change in sales due to the progress billing practices on major contracts 
cash provided by operating activities in was  cash provided was impacted by net loss adjusted for non cash items  lessened working capital demands from lower sales and improved turnover in accounts receivable 
major changes in working capital that provided cash included accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  inventory  major changes in working capital that used cash included prepaid expenses and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
net cash used in investing activities related to the acquisition of capital expenditures for property and equipment was  for compared with  for the same period in we received cash proceeds of approximately  from the sale of our conshohocken property as discussed in the following paragraph 
we are managing our capital expenditures in light of the current level of sales 
should sales increase in  we anticipate increased capital expenditure spending 
additional capital expenditures may be incurred related to the replacement facilities subject to the successful completion of the sale of our cincinnati property 
on may   we received approximately  in cash proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property 
approximately   was used to reduce the revolving line of credit and the balance was used to reduce term debt 
in november  we accepted an offer to sell our cincinnati  ohio property with a contemplated closing date of may  subject to various contingencies 
if we consummate the sale  the net proceeds will reduce the amount of the credit facilities 
a february agreement to sell our cincinnati property was terminated with the same party in september due to the potential purchaser failing to close in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
financing activities used cash of  during compared with cash used of  during the same period of current year financing activities included net payments of  on our revolving line of credit and payments of  on our term loan 
in addition  we raised  under a new subordinated debt obligation discussed earlier 
in the fourth quarter of  we received gross proceeds of  and issued  shares of common stock to a group of accredited investors 
under the subscription agreement to these investors  we issued an additional  shares during april of our common stock based on an earnings formula computed from fiscal year results as set forth in the subscription agreement 
dividends we did not pay any dividends during the years ended december  and and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future as we are party to various loan documents that prevent us from paying such dividends 
debt covenants the company s credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring compliance including at december  and each quarter through december  maximum leverage of to  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to and minimum interest coverage ratio of to as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
based on our projections  we anticipate that we will remain in compliance with such covenants 
however  any adverse changes in actual results from projections may place us at risk of not being able to comply with all of the covenants of the credit agreement 
in the event we cannot comply with the terms of the credit agreement as currently written  it would be necessary for us obtain a waiver or renegotiate our loan covenants  and there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful 
employee benefit obligations based on the assumptions used to value other postretirement obligations  life insurance benefits and retiree healthcare benefits  in the fourth quarter of  cash payments for these benefits are expected to be in the range of  in each of the next years 
based on current assumptions  estimated contributions of  may be required in for the pension plan and  for the retiree healthcare plan 
the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements  among other things and  accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments 
currently  our pension fund is under funded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table lists our contractual cash obligation as of december  in thousands of dollars 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a subordinated debt b operating lease obligations c purchase obligations d a as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
c primarily for as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
d primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts  which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods 
the judgments and estimates involved include management s ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete  among other factors  at each financial reporting period 
in addition  certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability 
contract costs include direct material  labor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and other overhead expenses 
selling and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes to job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made 
we provided for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts of and  at december  and respectively 
inventory costing the labor content of work in process and finished products and substantially all inventories of steel at our cincinnati facility approximately and of total inventories at december  and  respectively are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw material  energy and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
all other inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method 
the lifo method of inventory valuation for all classes of inventory approximated the fifo value at december  and impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use and assets to be disposed of 
for all assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new accounting standard  we will no longer amortize our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life and will be required to complete an annual impairment test 
we have determined that we have a single reporting unit  as defined in sfas no 
 within our company 
we completed our impairment test during as required by this accounting standard and have not recognized an impairment charge related to the adoption of this accounting standard in the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which requires significant judgment 
as of december   we have million of goodwill  
million of intangible assets finite life  million of indefinite life intangible assets  and million of property  plant  and equipment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and will provide necessary valuation allowances as required 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities at december  totaled million and million  respectively 
risk management activities we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into hedging relationships such that changes in the fair values or cash flows of items and transactions being hedged are expected to be offset by corresponding changes in the values of the derivatives 
accounting for derivative instruments is complex  as evidenced by the significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard  and continues to evolve 
as of december   there were no significant derivative instruments outstanding 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions we sponsor a pension plan for certain union employees 
we also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before january  several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include key assumptions  such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future 
an analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized 
for example  one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate 
at december   a basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and the annual post retirement expense by less than  additionally  a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives 
the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto including note  segment and related information and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
backlog our backlog consists of orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months 
our backlog  as of december  was million compared to million as of december  there can be no assurances that backlog will be replicated or increased or translated into higher revenues in the future 
the success of our business depends on a multitude of factors that are out of our control 
our operating results can be affected by the introduction of new products  new manufacturing technologies  rapid change of the demand for its products  decrease in average selling price over the life of the product as competition increases and our dependence on efforts of intermediaries to sell a portion of our product
