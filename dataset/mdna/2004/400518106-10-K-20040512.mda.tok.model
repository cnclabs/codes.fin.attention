our business general we operate on a week or week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in february 
fiscal was a week year and we included the extra week in our fourth quarter ending february  fiscal and were week years 
we are a global technology services company providing software  networks and professional services that power high performance solutions 
we are the world s leading operator of highly secure online lottery transaction processing systems  operating in countries worldwide and we have a growing presence in commercial services transaction processing 
in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated revenues were lottery related and approximately were derived from commercial services transaction processing 
comparatively  in fiscal  lottery related revenues and commercial services transaction processing revenues were approximately and of our consolidated revenues  respectively 
being a global business  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our operations outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  we derived of our revenues from international operations and of our revenues from our brazilian operations alone including of our revenues from caixa economica federal  the operator of brazil s national lottery  our largest customer in fiscal based on annual revenues 
in addition  substantial portions of our assets  primarily consisting of equipment we use to operate online lottery systems for our customers  are held outside of the united states 
we are also exposed to more general risks of international operations  including increased governmental regulation of the online lottery industry in the markets where we operate  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  and significant political instability 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized online lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
our service revenues are derived primarily from lottery service contracts  which are typically at least five years in duration  and generally provide compensation to us based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales 
these percentages vary depending on the size of the lottery and the scope of services provided to the lottery 
we primarily derive product sale revenues from the installation of new online lottery systems  installation of new software and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
our product margins fluctuate depending on the mix  volume and timing of product sale contracts 
our product sale revenues from period to period may not be comparable due to the size and timing of product sale transactions 
during fiscal  we currently anticipate that product sales will be in the range of million to million 
our business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
from time to time  competitors challenge our contract awards and there have been  and may continue to be  investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations conducted by governmental authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
in light of the fact that such investigations frequently are conducted in secret  we may not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation which might involve us 
because our reputation for integrity is an important factor in our business dealings with lottery and other governmental agencies  a governmental allegation or a finding of improper conduct on our part or attributable to us in any manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to retain existing contracts or to obtain new or renewal contracts 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
see the following for further information concerning these matters and other contingencies part i  item certain factors that may affect future performance government regulations and other actions affecting the online lottery industry could have a negative effect on our business and sales  part i  item legal proceedings  note to the consolidated financial statements 
brazil legal proceedings in late march after the close of fiscal  federal attorneys with brazil s public ministry the public ministry attorneys recommended that criminal charges be brought against nine individuals  including four senior officers of caixa economica federal cef  our customer and the operator of brazil s national lottery  and a former and a present employee of our company 
an investigation is being conducted on our behalf to ascertain the facts regarding this matter 
the company has encouraged our former and present employees to cooperate fully with the brazilian authorities investigating this matter 
in addition  the united states securities and exchange commission has made an informal inquiry as to this matter  and we are cooperating with this inquiry 
we recently have learned through a press release issued by the public ministry attorneys that a civil action has been initiated by the public ministry attorneys in the federal court of brasilia against gtech brasil ltd 
gtech brazil  former officers and employees of cef  the former president of racimec informatica brasileira sa racimec a brazilian company engaged in the lottery business and the predecessor of gtech brazil  and two former officers of gtech brazil 
the focus of the purported civil action is the contractual relationship between cef  gtech brazil and racimec for the period to revenues from our lottery contract with cef accounted for of our total fiscal revenues  making cef our largest customer in fiscal based upon annual revenues 
refer to part i  item  legal proceedings brazilian legal proceedings  the cef contract proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed disclosures regarding this matter 
acquisitions during fiscal  we extended our online lottery product offerings by acquiring interlott technologies  inc interlott  a leading provider of instant ticket vending machines for the worldwide lottery industry  for an aggregate purchase price  including assumed debt  of million 
we believe our acquisition of interlott will expand our presence in the instant ticket distribution business  thereby anchoring our self service strategy and allowing us to grow our core lottery market 
we also acquired a controlling equity position in polcard sa polcard this fiscal year  for a purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
polcard is the leading debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer and processor in poland 
this acquisition has broadened our offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of our core market of providing online lottery services 
refer to subsequent events below for information related to acquisitions completed after the close of fiscal we continue to evaluate a variety of opportunities to broaden our offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of our core market of providing online lottery services  such as the processing and transmission of commercial  non lottery transactions including bill payments  electronic tax payments  utility payments  prepaid cellular telephone recharges and retail based programs such as gift cards 
currently  our networks in brazil  poland  chile  the czech republic and jamaica process bill payments and other commercial service transactions 
in the near term  we expect to concentrate our efforts to grow commercial service revenues principally in the united states  latin america and eastern europe 
while our goal is to leverage our technology  infrastructure and relationships to drive growth in commercial services  if  in the course of pursuing these opportunities  we identify an opportunity to gain access to certain markets through the acquisition of existing businesses  we may consider making such acquisitions 
significant contract bids and extensions a majority of our revenues and cash flow is derived from our portfolio of long term online lottery service contracts  each of which in the ordinary course of our business is periodically the subject of competitive procurement or renegotiation 
in fiscal  we continued to execute against our growth strategy by signing new contracts and contract extensions both domestically and abroad 
contracts with new customers during fiscal  following public  competitive procurements  we signed contracts to provide new online and instant ticket lottery systems  terminals and related services with three new customers tennessee education lottery corporation  florida lottery  and mahapola higher education scholarship trust fund sri lanka 
tennessee education lottery corporation we signed a seven year integrated services contract which does not include any extension options with the tennessee education lottery corporation in january instant ticket sales commenced in january and lottery sales on the online lottery system commenced in march florida lottery we signed a six year integrated services contract with the florida lottery which is expected to commence in february and includes two  two year extension options 
sri lanka in sri lanka  we signed a year integrated services contract  which includes a five year extension option 
online sales had been expected to commence under our sri lanka lottery contract in september  but in march  lawsuits were filed by competitors challenging the award of the contract to us 
these legal challenges have delayed and may prevent implementation of our contract in sri lanka 
new contracts with existing customers in may  we entered into a master contract with the rhode island lottery the lottery that amends our existing contracts with the lottery and grants us the right to be the exclusive provider of online  instant ticket and video lottery central systems and services for the lottery during the year term of the master contract for a million up front license fee which we paid in july the master contract is part of a comprehensive economic development package that provides incentives for us to keep our world corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations in rhode island 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning this contract 
in february  following a competitive procurement  we were selected by the mexican lottery authority pronosticos para la asistencia publica to enter into a six year agreement to provide equipment and services for a new online lottery system and an associated telecommunications network 
in late april  we were notified that this award has been revoked 
this action follows a ruling by the mexican comptroller ministry in respect of a protest filed by unsuccessful competitors that declared our bid non compliant and disqualified us from the competitive procurement 
the mexican lottery authority subsequently announced that it has disqualified the sole remaining bidder as also being non compliant and has formally ended the procurement 
we intend to pursue all appropriate avenues to contest the comptroller s decision 
contract extensions during fiscal  we entered into contract extensions with existing customers in the following jurisdictions brazil national lottery  wisconsin  trinidad and tobago  the czech republic  michigan  china  denmark  new zealand  portugal  turkey  sweden  and idaho department of fish and game 
the national lottery of brazil was our largest contract in fiscal  as measured by annual revenues  accounting for of our consolidated revenues 
see part i  item legal proceedings brazilian legal proceedings  the cef contract extension proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning this contract 
new contracts and contract extensions subsequent to fiscal in march  following a competitive procurement  we were named as the apparent successful bidder to provide the washington lottery with lottery product vending machines and ongoing maintenance and support services 
the proposed three year contract includes three one year extension options 
also in march  following a competitive procurement  we received a notice of intent to award a contract to provide the illinois lottery with instant ticket dispensing machines and ongoing maintenance and support services 
the proposed five year contract includes a three year extension option 
in april  we signed a five year contract extension with our customer in luxembourg to provide lottery terminals  products and ongoing services through october other contract information during fiscal  following a competitive procurement  the nebraska lottery authority selected another vendor to provide equipment and services for a new online lottery gaming system upon the scheduled expiration of our current contract with the nebraska lottery in june  however  we will remain as the nebraska lottery s instant ticket products and system supplier through june in may after the close of fiscal  we were notified by our customer  loteria electronica de puerto rico  of its intent to negotiate a contract to provide a new online lottery system and an associated telecommunications network with another vendor to take effect upon the expiration of our current contract in march our compensation under lottery service contracts is typically based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales 
over the past several fiscal years  we have experienced and may continue to experience a reduction in the percentage of lottery ticket sales we receive from certain customers resulting from contract rebids  extensions and renewals due to a number of factors  including the substantial growth of lottery sales over the last decade  reductions in the cost of technology and telecommunications services  and general market and competitive dynamics 
in anticipation and response to these trends  beginning in fiscal  we began the implementation of our new enterprise series led technology strategy combined with the implementation of a number of ongoing cost savings initiatives and efficiency improvement programs designed to enable us to maintain our market leadership in the lottery industry 
we are unable to determine at this time the likely effect of this trend on our business 
see part i  item certain factors that may affect future performance our lottery operations are dependent upon our continued ability to retain and extend our existing contracts and win new contracts and significant developments since the start of fiscal lottery contract awards for further information concerning these matters 
consolidation of west greenwich technology associates  lp we have a limited partnership interest in west greenwich technology associates  lp the partnership  which owns our world headquarters facilities and leases them to us 
the general partner of the partnership is an unrelated third party 
this partnership is considered a variable interest entity commonly referred to as a special purpose entity  as defined by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  we accounted for the partnership using the equity method of accounting 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we consolidated the partnership in accordance with fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity as defined by its primary beneficiary 
as a result  we recorded our world headquarters facilities owned by the partnership as an asset and the partnership s loan as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this interpretation increased balance sheet assets and liabilities by million and million  respectively  and resulted in a one time  non cash  after tax gain of million 
the pre tax gain of million is recorded in other income expense in our consolidated income statements and not as a cumulative effect adjustment because the gain is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
common stock split in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a for common stock split that was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on may  to shareholders of record on may  all references to common shares and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for fiscal and as presented in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies listed below that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are recorded in advance payments from customers in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record liquidated damage assessments  which are penalties incurred due to a failure to meet specified deadlines or performance standards  as a reduction of revenue in the period they become probable and estimable 
liquidated damage assessments equaled  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenues from commercial transaction processing services are recorded based on the net amount retained in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we generally conduct out lottery business under two types of contractual arrangements facilities management contracts and product sales contracts 
facilities management contracts under typical facilities management contracts  we construct  install and operate the lottery system  and retain ownership of the lottery system 
these contracts generally provide for a variable amount of monthly or weekly service fees paid to us directly from the lottery authority based on a percentage of a lottery s gross online and instant ticket sales 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the period earned and are classified as service revenue in our consolidated income statements 
product sales contracts under product sales contracts  we construct  sell  deliver and install a turnkey online lottery system lottery system or lottery equipment  and license the computer software for a fixed price  and the lottery authority subsequently operates the lottery system 
because product sales contracts include significant customization  modification and other services prior to customer acceptance that are considered essential to the lottery software inherent in our lottery systems  revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  amounts due to us  and costs incurred by us in constructing the lottery system  prior to customer acceptance  are deferred 
revenue attributable to the lottery system is classified as sales of products in our consolidated income statements and is recognized upon customer acceptance as long as there are no substantial doubts regarding collectibility the completed contract method of accounting 
revenue attributable to any ongoing services provided subsequent to customer acceptance is classified as service revenue in our consolidated income statements and is recognized in the period earned because the lottery system has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the ongoing services 
in certain product sale contracts primarily the sale of lottery terminals  we are not responsible for installation 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  customer acceptance criteria if any have been met  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
income tax expense and accruals our annual income tax rate is based upon our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the result of a tax audit 
an estimated effective income tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 
tax law requires items to be included in the income tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  our annual income tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our income tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our income tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a tax deduction or credit in that tax jurisdiction 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent income tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our income tax return but we have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states income tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe our reserves reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
trade accounts receivable  net and sales type lease receivables we evaluate the collectibility of trade accounts and sales type lease receivables on a customer by customer basis and we believe our reserves are adequate  however  if economic circumstances change significantly resulting in a major customer s inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations to us  original estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by significant amounts requiring additional reserves 
during fiscal and  we did not experience any collectibility or billing problems with any major customers or geographic localities for which revenue has been recognized 
inventories and obsolescence inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventories include amounts related to products we manufacture or assemble for our long term service contracts  which are transferred to systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts in our consolidated balance sheets upon shipment 
inventories also include amounts related to product sales contracts  including product sales under long term contracts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  should future sales forecasts change  our original estimates of obsolescence could increase by a significant amount requiring additional reserves 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired 
other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we review other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include  among others  significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
because we have a single operating and reportable business segment the transaction processing segment  we perform our goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the transaction processing segment with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the transaction processing segment exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  a write down would be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include such items as declines in revenues  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the economic or political stability of a particular country  which may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets may be impaired  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these long lived assets would be compared to their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary

the following discussion on service revenues should be read in conjunction with the table below in millions fiscal year ended change february  february  service revenues domestic lottery international lottery commercial services all other the increase in domestic lottery service revenues was primarily due to higher service revenues from an increase in sales by our domestic lottery customers of approximately with the balance principally due to the combined effect of an extra week of service revenues in fiscal and the acquisition of interlott 
while we are not able to quantify precisely the reasons for increases in sales by our domestic lottery customers  we believe that in general  such increases are attributable to enhanced marketing efforts by state lottery authorities seeking to offset declining tax revenues and the successful introduction by state lottery authorities of new games and products  modifications to existing games such as matrix changes and more frequent drawings and expanded distribution channels  such as keno 
the increase in international lottery service revenues includes higher service revenues from an increase in sales by our international lottery customers of approximately  along with the impact of the effect of an extra week of service revenues in fiscal of approximately  with the balance of the increase due to the combined impact of favorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by contractual rate changes 
while we are not able to quantify precisely the reasons for increases in sales by our international lottery customers  we believe that in general  such increases are attributable to more rapid growth rates typical of newer lottery jurisdictions  the successful introduction of new games and modifications to existing games such as matrix changes and more frequent drawings 
the increase in commercial transaction processing services was primarily due to the acquisition of polcard  which contributed million of service revenues in fiscal product sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million or 
significant product sales in the prior year included the sale of a turnkey system to our customer in portugal  and significant product sales in the current year included the sale of an interactive system to our customer in the united kingdom 
our service margins improved from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to lower depreciation of approximately percentage points  principally related to fully depreciated assets associated with our contract with caixa economica federal in brazil  with the balance of the increase primarily due to the impact of higher service revenues 
our product margins fluctuate depending on the mix  volume and timing of product sales contracts 
our product margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to the different mix of sales 
operating expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or 
this increase was driven by million of increased spending on selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily driven by increased business development activities in poland and mexico associated with our commercial services business and the consolidation of polcard and interlott 
in addition  our investment in research and development increased by million as we continue our efforts to accelerate the development and deployment of enterprise series into the marketplace 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were and during fiscal and  respectively 
interest income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million reflecting interest earned on the cash proceeds from the million of debt issued in the third quarter of fiscal equity income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to lower equity income resulting principally from lower revenues generated by our joint venture in taiwan 
the components of other income in fiscal and fiscal are as follows in millions fiscal year ended february  february  one time  non cash  pre tax gain resulting from the consolidation of the partnership that owns our world headquarters facilities minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries foreign exchange gains losses net charges associated with the early retirement of debt other total other income the million one time  non cash  pre tax gain resulting from the consolidation of the partnership that owns our world headquarters facilities was recorded in compliance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
weighted average diluted shares in fiscal increased by million shares to million shares  primarily due to the assumed conversion of our million principal amount of convertible debentures the debentures into shares of our common stock  resulting in a decrease to diluted earnings per share of approximately 
these debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share when  among other circumstances  our stock closes above per share for at least out of consecutive trading days prior to the date of surrender for conversion 
there are a total of million shares issuable upon the conversion of the debentures 
the debentures were convertible for out of trading days in fiscal  and accordingly  million shares were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal principally due to a larger percentage of international profits taxed at rates that are lower than the us statutory tax rate 
comparison of fiscal with revenues were million in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal  down million  or 
the following discussion on service revenues should be read in conjunction with the table below in millions fiscal year ended change february  february  service revenues domestic lottery international lottery commercial services all other service revenues increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal had last year s average exchange rates prevailed throughout fiscal  we estimate that service revenues would have increased by approximately compared to last year 
the increase in domestic lottery service revenues includes higher service revenues from an increase in sales by our domestic lottery customers of approximately  partially offset by the combined impact of lower jackpot activity  net new contracts and contractual rate changes of approximately 
the increase in international lottery service revenues includes higher service revenues from an increase in sales by our international lottery customers of approximately and the combined impact of higher jackpot activity  net new contracts and contractual rate changes of approximately 
these positive factors were partially offset by lower service revenues of approximately resulting from the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
service revenues from commercial transaction processing services primarily in brazil  were down slightly from the prior year due to the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
in local currency  commercial transaction processing service revenues increased approximately over the prior year 
product sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
product sales in the prior year included significant sales of terminals and software to our customer in the united kingdom 
the absence of sales to our united kingdom customer in fiscal was partially offset by the sale of a turnkey lottery system to our customer in portugal during the current fiscal year 
our service margins improved from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal service margins were percentage points higher due to the prior year write off of assets and reserves associated with the economic instability in argentina and impairment charges relating to an under performing international contract and percentage points higher due to lower depreciation principally related to contract extensions and fully depreciated assets associated with existing contracts 
higher sales by our lottery customers  new contracts that generated incrementally higher gross margins  and improved operational and service delivery efficiencies also contributed to the improvement in service margins in fiscal our product margins improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal product margins were negatively impacted by inventory reserves recorded in connection with a product sale contract with a customer in italy 
operating expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
this decrease was primarily driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives and emphasis on improving operating efficiencies  along with the benefit of the adoption of the new accounting standard on goodwill  which eliminated approximately million of goodwill amortization during the current year 
in addition  we recorded a credit against the special charge taken in fiscal of million  which reflects lower than anticipated severance costs associated with the fiscal value assessment of our business operations 
these declines in operating expenses were partially offset by million of increased spending on research and development in an effort to accelerate deployment of our enterprise series platform in the marketplace 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were and during fiscal and  respectively 
equity income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or  primarily due to equity income from the first full year of operations of our joint venture in taiwan 
the components of other income expense in fiscal and fiscal are as follows in millions fiscal year ended february  february  foreign exchange gains losses net charges associated with the early retirement of debt minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries write off of our cost method investment in the common stock of an internet security developer gain on the sale of a majority interest in our subsidiary in the czech republic amortization of the gain on the sale of our equity interest in camelot group plc other total other income expense during the third quarter of fiscal  we used cash on hand to repurchase the remaining million of our series a senior notes due in connection with this repurchase  we recorded net charges of million  principally comprised of tender premiums to the holders of the notes  net of gains from the sale of interest rate swaps associated with the notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of series a senior notes due and million of series b senior notes due collectively  the senior notes 
in connection with this repurchase  we recorded charges of million  principally comprised of tender premiums of million to the holders of the notes  net of gains on interest rate swaps of million  along with make whole premiums of million associated with the refinancing of our world headquarters facilities by the partnership that owns the facilities 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to our debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year and the third quarter of this fiscal year  resulting in lower debt balances and lower interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year  we issued million principal amount of convertible debentures debentures 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the debentures to retire million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we used cash on hand to repurchase the remaining million of series a senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal weighted average diluted shares in fiscal declined million shares to million shares as a result of our share repurchase programs  resulting in an improvement to diluted earnings per share of approximately 
our debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share when our stock closes at or above per share for out of consecutive trading days prior to the date of surrender for conversion 
for fiscal and  million shares issuable upon the conversion of the debentures were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because  in accordance with their terms  the debentures had not yet become convertible 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths 
we expect cash flows from operations in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal levels and we expect to meet our financial commitments and operating needs in the foreseeable future 
we expect to use cash generated from operating activities primarily for aggregate contractual obligations  to fund all or a portion of the cash needed for potential acquisitions and to pay dividends 
our debt ratings of baa from moody s and bbb from standard and poor s contribute to our ability to access capital markets at attractive prices 
these ratings reflect several factors  including our strong cash flows and balance sheet 
analysis of cash flows during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations which  along with cash on hand  was principally used to purchase million of systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts and to fund acquisitions of million 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we issued million of senior notes 
at february   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of short term investment securities 
our business is capital intensive 
we currently estimate that net cash to be used for investing activities in fiscal will be in the range of million to million  including approximately million related to the acquisitions of spielo manufacturing incorporated and leeward islands lottery holding company inc see subsequent events below 
we expect our principal sources of liquidity to be existing cash and short term investment balances  along with cash we generate from operations 
our credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of million and matures in june as of february   there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
up to million of the credit facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
as of february   after considering million of letters of credit issued and outstanding  there was million available for borrowing under the credit facility 
we currently expect that our cash flow from operations  existing cash and short term investment balances and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to fund our anticipated working capital and ordinary capital expenditure needs  to service our debt obligations  to fund anticipated internal growth  to fund all or a portion of the cash needed for potential acquisitions  to pay dividends  to fund the capital requirements under our master contract with the rhode island lottery and to repurchase shares of our common stock  from time to time  under our share repurchase programs

these bonds give the beneficiary the right to obtain payment and or performance from the issuer of the bond if the events set forth in the bond occur 
in the case of performance bonds  which generally have a term of one year  such events include our failure to perform our obligations under the applicable contract 
to obtain these bonds  we are required to indemnify the issuers against the costs they incur if a beneficiary exercises its rights under a bond 
historically  our customers have not exercised their rights under these bonds and we do not currently anticipate that they will do so

we do not engage in currency or interest rate speculation 
interest rate market risk interest rate market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of our total debt or current earnings resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt and change in the estimated fair value due to hypothetical changes in interest rates are as follows dollars in millions estimated fair value at february  increase in decrease in interest rates interest rates million of senior notes million of senior notes million of convertible debentures the estimated fair values above were determined by an independent investment banker and the values of the senior notes were determined after taking into consideration million of interest rate swaps

in addition  a significant portion of the costs attributable to our foreign currency revenues are payable in the local currencies 
in limited circumstances  but whenever possible  we negotiate clauses into our contracts that allow for price adjustments should a material change in foreign exchange rates occur 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce the exposure associated with certain firm commitments  variable service revenues and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
however  we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
these contracts generally have maturities of months or less and are regularly renewed to provide continuing coverage throughout the year
