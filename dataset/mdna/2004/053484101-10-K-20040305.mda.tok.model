item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  incorporated in the state of maryland and focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
as of december   we had current operating communities  which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance 
the net operating income of these communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels  and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
we create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartments and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
this report  including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements that predict or indicate future events and trends that do not report historical matters 
actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page of this report 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
business description and community information overview we believe that apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle 
we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist  and where new household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we evaluate the appropriate allocation of product type within our individual markets  which are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states  to ensure that our product mix will perform at a high level and achieve our portfolio objectives 
our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products which is currently primarily upscale apartment communities and services  with an intense focus on our customer 
a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale commanding among the highest rents in their submarkets 
we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal to offer a broad range of products and services 
we believe that lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle 
however  we believe we are toward the end of a period of the business cycle where rents have been resetting to lower levels  resulting in a decline in cash flows in as compared to prior years 
a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in and  particularly in the technology  telecom and financial services sectors 
this has resulted in continued weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates 
however  the rate of decline has been diminishing  and we expect to be a year of transition 
an improving economy with modest job growth is anticipated in  which should result in the stabilization of apartment market fundamentals and an improved demand and supply balance during the year 
although we do not expect this to result in revenue growth for our current operating communities in  it should curtail the significant declines in revenue that those communities experienced over the last two years 
with the expected transition of apartment fundamentals  we are preparing for a transition in certain aspects of our business activity 
with our in house capabilities and expertise we believe we are well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop  acquire and operate apartment homes in our target markets 
however  the level of development or acquisition volume  or disposition activity  is heavily influenced by capital and real estate market conditions 
during  in response to capital markets conditions and strong apartment demand  we curtailed development and acquisition activity and increased our disposition activity 
we sold assets that did not meet our long term investment criteria in markets where there was strong relative demand by investors in apartment communities 
this allowed us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle  and provided additional liquidity 
in  we plan to continue our disposition activity  although at a reduced level  and expect to increase development and acquisition volume 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities  and development rights ie  land or land options held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities  for which detailed discussions can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we owned or held an ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which eleven communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical  in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain  and are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results 
as a reit that owns  operates and develops apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and reit status 
a discussion of all of our accounting policies  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
in accordance with our standard lease terms  rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis 
any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease generally one year 
a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in results of operations 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when active development commences until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use  which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  deeming future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
we generally capitalize only non recurring expenditures 
we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds  ii extends the useful life of the asset  and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred 
recurring make ready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements  ii floor coverings  iii interior painting  and iv other redecorating costs 
because we expense carpet replacements  our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year following our peak summer leasing period 
we capitalize purchases of personal property  such as computers and furniture  only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds  we generally expense replacements of personal property 
in  and  the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions  development and redevelopment were   and  respectively 
for established and other stabilized communities  we recorded non revenue generating capital expenditures of  or per apartment home in   or per apartment home in and  or per apartment home in in addition  revenue generating capital expenditures  such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home  including carpet and appliance replacements  related to these communities was  in   in and  in we anticipate that capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases  and expensed maintenance costs will fluctuate with turnover 
asset impairment evaluation if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community  our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the community 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community  we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell 
we account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment  we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value 
due to the nature of these investments  an impairment in value can be difficult to determine 
reit status we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions  net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market  disposition and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses net operating income corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense impairment loss total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities   n a interest income venture partner interest in profit sharing minority interest in consolidated partnerships income before gain on sale of communities gain on sale of communities income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of communities total discontinued operations net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased  to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities  including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities  and the absence of impairment losses in  partially offset by a decline in net operating income from our established communities  the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds received in and increases in interest and depreciation expense 
net income available to common stockholders decreased by  to  in due to fewer gains on sales of communities in and impairment losses recognized in  coupled with a decline in net operating income from our established communities and increases in interest and depreciation  partially offset by a decrease in dividends attributable to preferred stock 
net operating income noi is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes  and excludes corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses  interest income and expense  general and administrative expense  impairment losses  equity in income of unconsolidated entities  minority interest in consolidated partnerships  venture partner interest in profit sharing  depreciation expense  gain on sale of communities and income from discontinued operations 
we believe that noi is an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level costs 
this is more reflective of the operating performance of a community  and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures  with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi for the three years ending december   along with a reconciliation to net income  is provided in the preceding table 
the noi decreases of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories increase decrease increase decrease established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities non allocated total the noi decreases in established communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets 
the continued impact of job losses in many of our submarkets  in addition to strong single family home sales  have aggravated a weak demand environment  causing market rental rates to decline in order to keep occupancies stable 
economic forecasts project modest job growth in our submarkets in  and we therefore expect apartment market fundamentals to stabilize during the year 
although the rate of decline in the apartment market fundamentals is diminishing  which should curtail the significant declines in revenue that our established communities have experienced over the last two years  we expect our established communities revenue to decline as much as in as compared to and operating expenses  particularly related to property taxes  to continue to increase up to in  resulting in continued year over year declines in our established communities noi of up to for rental and other income increased in both and due to rental income generated from communities acquired in and newly developed communities  partially offset by declines in effective rental rates and business interruption proceeds 
while we expect apartment fundamentals to stabilize in with modest job growth in our markets  there is typically a three to six month lag between improvements in job growth and improvements in operating performance 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  apartment homes for and  in this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from communities acquired in and newly developed communities  partially offset by communities sold in and the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  in as compared to  in and  in primarily due to the weakened demand in certain of our submarkets 
established communities rental revenue decreased  in and  in these decreases are due to declining effective rental rates  partially offset by a slight increase in economic occupancy in for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  compared to  for  partially due to increased concessions granted in the latter half of and during the average economic occupancy increased from in to in economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we expect rental income for established communities to decline as much as in as compared to although most of our markets have experienced weak demand caused by job losses  low mortgage rates and shifting demographics  rental income from established communities has been impacted the most by significant declines in average rental rates in certain northern california and northeast submarkets 
northern california  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue in  experienced a decline in rental revenue in as compared to  partially related to the continued impact of job losses in the technology sector 
although economic occupancy in northern california increased in as compared to  average rental rates dropped from  to  the northeast region accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue during and has also experienced a decline in rental revenue in as compared to  primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector 
average rental rates dropped from  to  in as compared to  and economic occupancy remained flat during those same periods 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
however  we consider rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with gaap in helping investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
in addition  rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions  which is an indicator of current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented as established community classification is not applicable prior to january  see note segment reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a concessions granted per move in for established communities averaged during  an increase of from in concessions granted increased during as compared to primarily due to declining market conditions and a weak demand environment 
we expect the high concessionary environment to continue into management  development and other fees decreased during and increased during primarily due to the recognition in of  in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest 
in addition  we managed fewer communities in as compared to prior years 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased in both and due to the addition of recently developed and redeveloped apartment homes and communities acquired in  coupled with increased expenses due to inclement weather  insurance and bad debt expenses 
in the first half of  severe winter weather  primarily in the northeast and mid atlantic  increased snow removal and utility costs by approximately  in addition  insurance expense has increased over the past two years as the insurance and reinsurance markets have deteriorated  resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector 
recently property insurance rates began to decline 
to benefit from declining rates  we completed an early renewal of our property insurance policy effective july  accordingly  we expect a decline in property insurance premiums  which will result in flat or declining overall insurance costs for as compared to prior year periods 
bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of the continued impact of job losses and the weakened economy 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  to  in due to inclement weather  insurance and bad debt discussed above 
during  operating expenses increased  due to the increases in insurance  marketing and bad debt expenses 
we expect expense growth to moderate in due to reduced property insurance costs and bad debt expenses 
property taxes increased in both and due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes 
for established communities  property taxes increased in and by  and  respectively  primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions 
we expect property taxes to increase during as local jurisdictions look for additional revenue sources to balance budgets 
we manage property tax increases internally and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in as a result of increased legal expenses due to construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development  partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the implementation of a new property management leasing system in and a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs 
during  corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in but not in  partially offset by an increase in abandoned pursuit costs 
abandoned pursuit costs related to development rights which are not probable for future development decreased  from  in to  in we expect corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in due to additional compensation costs  including growth due to the addition of newly developed communities and the expensing of options 
interest expense increased in both and primarily due to the issuance in late of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility  partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short term and long term borrowings 
depreciation expense increased in both and primarily due to acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities 
general and administrative expense g a increased in primarily as a result of an increase in our directors and officers d o insurance  which we renewed in march in the past year  the d o market has experienced increased and high profile claim activity resulting in higher insurance premiums 
g a decreased in as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in due to the retirement of a senior executive 
unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in we expect g a to increase up to in due to higher compensation expense and additional internal audit and corporate governance costs 
impairment loss of  was recorded during related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition 
no impairment losses were recorded in either or equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in primarily due to our  share of the gain recognized on the sale of a community accounted for under the equity method in which we held a interest 
during  equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method 
interest income decreased in and due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates 
venture partner interest in profit sharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit sharing arrangement as discussed in note  investments in unconsolidated entities  of our consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in income increase in expense in both years are due to increases in the net income of the underlying real estate as the related community moved out of the initial lease up phase and achieved stabilization 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities held for sale as of december  and communities sold during the period from january  through december  the decreases in both years are primarily due to the sale of one community in and eleven communities in gain on sale of communities  including discontinued operations  of   and  were realized in  and  respectively 
the amount of gains realized depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
the large gains on sales of communities reflect our strategy to sell assets in a transactional market environment where buyers are offering prices that are historically high relative to current operating cash flow provided by these communities 
we believe this is reflective of a broader trend in the capital markets  where investments with relatively secure yields and growth potential are being valued more highly than in prior years 
a partial reversal of these trends could occur if long term interest rates rise significantly 
we expect aggregate gains on community sales to decline in as we sell fewer assets 
dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased in both and  primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during and in addition  in response to the securities and exchange commission clarification of emerging issues task force eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  we have revised the presentation of our and operating results to include the initial offering costs as additional dividends of  and  respectively 
funds from operations ffo is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates  affect our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   a decrease of  from  on december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds and changes in noi from established communities as discussed earlier in this report  coupled with the timing of payment of our property insurance premiums 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities of  in related to proceeds from asset dispositions  partially offset by investments in assets through development and redevelopment of apartment communities 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures we began the development of seven new communities 
these communities  if developed as expected  will contain a total of  apartment homes  and the total capital cost  including land acquisition costs  is projected to be approximately  we also completed the development of seven communities containing a total of  apartment homes for a total capital cost  including land acquisition cost  of  we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of in addition  we sold twelve communities and one land parcel in  including one community previously held through an equity investment  generating net proceeds of  these proceeds are being used to develop new communities and to partially repay amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility  which is discussed below 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended december   primarily due to the redemption of preferred stock  dividends paid  repayment of certain unsecured notes and common stock repurchases  partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  the issuance of mortgage notes payable and an issuance of common stock 
see note  notes payable  unsecured notes and credit facility  and note  stockholders equity  of our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  preferred stock dividends and downreit partnership unit distributions  the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  opportunities for the acquisition of improved property  and development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged 
we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility 
variable rate unsecured credit facility we have a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jp morgan chase and fleet national bank serving as co agents for a syndicate of commercial banks 
under the terms of the credit facility  if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional  and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment  then we will be able to increase the facility up to  and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase  such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
we pay participating banks  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of approximately  in quarterly installments 
the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on february  
pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies  a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by to 
a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had  outstanding under this competitive bid option at february  priced at libor plus  or 
we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility  including  but not limited to  maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios  a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels  and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed of our ffo  except as may be required to maintain our reit status 
the existing facility matures in may  unless we exercise a one year renewal at our option 
we expect to renegotiate this facility prior to maturity without exercising the renewal option  however there can be no assurance that the renegotiation will occur 
at february    was outstanding   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings 
we also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures  a portion of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
in february   in unsecured notes with an annual interest rate of matured and was repaid with proceeds drawn under our unsecured credit facility 
in addition  we repaid  in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by a current community  along with any unpaid interest  prior to its scheduled maturity of august no prepayment penalties were incurred 
also in february  we had credit enhancements  including interest rate swaps  on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt that expired according to the original terms and that have not been extended 
however  we have replaced the credit enhancements on this debt  including replacing the interest rate swaps with interest rate caps ranging from to 
the underlying debt has a weighted average variable interest rate exclusive of credit enhancement fees  facility fees  trustees fees  etc 
of as of february   which has been capped at a weighted average interest rate of through the interest rate caps

variable rate construction loan matured in december and was refinanced in april  extending the maturity date to april  with a one year extension available to april future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had eleven new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had two communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  and or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights 
we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
we increased our disposition program during to a level totaling  in response to real estate and capital markets conditions  as well as strong institutional demand for product in our markets  we plan to continue to sell communities into  although at reduced levels 
however  we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce total revenues  total expenses  noi and ffo 
we intend to engage in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the possible formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities 
this fund would serve  for a period of three years from the date of its final closing or until a significant portion of its committed capital is invested  as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions including  among others  significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions  properties acquired in tax deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund  if any 
the fund would not restrict our development activities  which would not be a part of the fund  and would terminate after a term of eight years subject to two one year extensions 
we intend to actively pursue the formation of the fund  but there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or  if formed  what its size  terms or investment performance will be 
we have preliminarily targeted that the fund would have approximately  available for investment consisting of approximately  of fund equity  of which we would commit approximately of the total  and approximately  of debt financing 
we are also considering the use of several joint ventures  pursuant to which a portion of future developments would be held through a partnership vehicle 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
each joint venture or partnership agreement will be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
however  we cannot assure you that we will enter into joint ventures in the future  or that  if we do  we will achieve our objectives 
we have minority interest investments in three technology companies  one of which has a remaining unfunded commitment of  which we expect to be released from without payment in the first quarter of we have no other obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments

we have not guaranteed this debt  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entity be unable to do so 
there are no lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes  outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of december  the table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in see liquidity and capital resources 
common and preferred stock activity stock repurchase program in our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program  under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions 
the stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow  as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions  will provide the source of funding for the program  with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed 
through february   we have acquired  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of  under this program 
we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since march  issuance of common stock in august  we completed a common stock offering totaling  shares at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately  were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding on the unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
shelf registration statement we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement originally provided  of debt and equity capacity  however   has been utilized as a result of the common stock offering described above 
we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on cost effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times 
redemption of preferred stock in march  we redeemed all  outstanding shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of per share  plus in accrued and unpaid dividends  for an aggregate redemption price of  including accrued dividends of  the redemption price was funded by the sale of  shares of series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of  the dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to per annum three month libor plus of the liquidation preference 
as permitted under the terms of such preferred stock  we redeemed all of the series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock in may  for an aggregate redemption price of  including dividends of  we currently have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at a stated value of  this series has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions 
shares outstanding payable annual liquidation non redeemable series february  quarterly rate preference prior to h  march  june  september  december october  inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in the event of significant inflation  this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  as is currently being experienced  we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
furthermore  a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately  of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of december  the swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt were not electively entered into by us but  rather  were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings 
because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
however  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by
