item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about the company and its bank subsidiary s financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis

financial condition the bank the company s only subsidiary functions as a financial intermediary  and as such  its financial condition should be examined in terms of trends in its sources and uses of funds 
the following comparison of average balances indicates how the bank has managed its sources and uses of funds 
comments in this section relate to annual average amounts  not year end amounts 
average balances are the average of the monthly averages sources and uses of funds trends average amount average amount average balance change change balance change change balance thousands of dollars funding uses loans taxable investment securities tax exempt investment securities federal funds sold interest bearing bank balances total uses funding sources demand deposits non interest bearing interest bearing savings deposits time deposits federal funds purchased and other borrowings repurchase agreements other total sources the bank uses its funds primarily to support its lending activities 
average loans increased by  or in after increasing by  or in the increase was largely the result of continued emphasis on lending by bank management and continued economic conditions in the local market 
average taxable bond investments  another use of funds  increased by  or in and are used to provide liquidity for the bank  while tax exempt bond investments decreased by  or and provide enhanced yield due to their special income tax treatment 
the bank s increase in earning assets from to was funded by increased deposits 
the bank sought to grow its loan portfolio in  and to fund this growth  it sought deposits in the local market place 
although deposit growth was from all types of deposits  the bank showed the greatest absolute growth in now and money market accounts 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary function of asset liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
marketable investment securities  particularly those of shorter maturities  are a principal source of asset liquidity 
securities maturing or expected to be called within one year or less amounted to  at december  representing of the investment securities portfolio  a decrease from the amount of  this is due to the bank making an effort to shorten its average bond maturity while rates are low 
shortening the maturity of the portfolio will have the effect of not locking in investment rates while rates are low 
the bank moderates its liquidity needs by maintaining short term borrowing lines with several regional banks 
at year end  the bank had lines of credit established with other banking institutions totaling  brokered deposits are deposit instruments  such as certificates of deposit  bank investment contracts and certain municipal investment contracts that are issued through brokers who then offer and or sell these deposit instruments to one or more investors 
the bank does not currently purchase or sell brokered deposits 
maturities of time certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more  outstanding at december   are summarized as follows time deposits thousands of dollars months or less over through months over through months over months total interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans  which are tied to the prime rate  differ considerably from long term investment securities and fixed rate loans 
similarly  time deposits over  and money market accounts are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings accounts 
the shorter term interest rate sensitivities are key to measuring the interest sensitivity gap  or excess interest sensitive earning assets over interest bearing liabilities 
the following table shows the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  for the first year  interest sensitive assets exceed liabilities by  over the following two years  liabilities re price faster than assets 
the excess of interest bearing liabilities over interest earning assets for the one to three year period is primarily related to the longer maturities of cd s and now and mma accounts that are regarded as much less rate sensitive 
as of december thousands of dollars over days days years years interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap the primary interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the one year maturity range are loans and time deposits 
trying to minimize this gap while maintaining earnings is a continual challenge in a changing interest rate environment and one of the objectives of the bank s asset liability management strategy 
management has adopted a philosophy of balancing assets and liabilities over a three year period  which it has accomplished 
management feels that the rate rewards of being balanced over a three year period more than offset the risk of being modestly unbalanced over the short term 
capital resources the bank maintains a strong capital base to take advantage of business opportunities while ensuring that it has resources to absorb the risks inherent in the business 
in january  the federal reserve board released new standards for measuring capital adequacy for us banking organizations 
in general  the standards require banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital based on risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk will require more capital backing than assets with lower risk 
in addition  banks are required to maintain capital to support  on a risk adjusted basis  certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
the federal reserve board standards classify capital into two tiers  referred to as tier and tier for the bank  tier capital consists of common shareholders equity 
tier capital consists of allowance for loan and lease losses 
all banks must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets of 
to be considered adequately capitalized  banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of of qualifying total tier and tier capital to risk adjusted total assets and at least ratio of tier capital to total assets 
the bank had corresponding ratios of and at year end 
capital that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the table below illustrates the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december thousands of dollars tier capital tier capital total qualifying capital risk adjusted total assets including off balance exposures tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio at december   there were no commitments for expenditures that would impact the capital of the bank or the company 
relationship between significant financial ratios the following table illustrates this relationship where the percent return on equity times the percent of earnings retained equals the internal capital growth percentage return on average equity earnings retained internal capital growth from a level of in  the rate of internal capital growth has increased to in  in and in this increasing growth rate is directly related to the increasing profitability of the bank 
to maintain adequate capital  the bank and the company will continue their efforts to maintain its level of earnings and will give appropriate consideration to capital needs for expansion and growth before determining annual dividend pay out to the company or to shareholders 
results of operations the company s net income for was  a decrease of from earnings of  but up from earnings of  on a per share basis  net income for the similar periods were  and 
after retroactively adjusting for annual stock dividends 
income improved significantly from to  despite the growth in overhead due to the opening of a branch and an investment sales subsidiary of the bank and expansion of the trust department 
however  income was impacted by low interest rates and the proliferation of refinancing in the real estate markets 
the overhead associated with the replacement of refinanced loans and with the growth of the bank impacted the bank s net profits 
however  many of these expenses are non recurring and the overhead associated with the loan portfolio is expected to return to more normal levels in net interest income was up by  for over these increased revenues were offset by increased loan loss reserve expenses of  due to loan portfolio growth 
most of this growth and corresponding expense occurred in the fourth quarter and accordingly was too late in the year to significantly contribute to increased net interest income 
net interest income is the major component of the bank s earning capacity 
it represents the difference or spread between interest income on earning assets primarily loans  investment securities and federal funds sold and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits 
the spread is considered positive when interest earning assets exceed interest paying liabilities 
net interest income is also affected by changes in interest rates earned and interest rates paid  and by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
to the extent possible  the bank follows a strategy intended to insulate the bank s interest rate spread from adverse changes in interest rates by maintaining spreads through the adjustability of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio was repriceable or expected to repay within one year 
results of operations can be measured by various ratio analyses 
two widely recognized performance indicators are return on equity and return on assets 
the bank s return on average equity was in  down from in  and in the bank s returns on average assets roaa were 
in and in to 
in in  the board of directors adopted a strategy of growth for the bank knowing that the increased overhead would impact the bank s earnings for several years 
the strategy anticipated that increased revenues would eventually offset the substantial increase in overhead resulting from branch openings 
this in fact happened in through with the slower growth in overhead expenses  earnings improved during those years 
with the opening of the new branch in  some of the overhead efficiencies were lost  but were regained in and early in  the bank increased staffing in both the financial product sales staff and in the loan production area 
by the fourth quarter of  both areas began showing significant increases in business which will result in future income to the bank 
loans loan portfolio the following table shows the bank s loans distribution at the end of each of the last two years 
december  thousand of dollars domestic loans commercial and other real estate construction real estate residential real estate other installment consumer non accrual total domestic loans real estate mortgage loans at year end and comprised the greatest percentage of total loans 
commercial non real estate and consumer loans were approximately and respectively at the year end the growth in loans outstanding at year end was the result of an initiative by management to grow the loan portfolio 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio 
management s methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the volume  growth and composition of the loan portfolio 
each credit on the bank s internal loan watch list is evaluated periodically to estimate potential losses 
in addition  minimum estimates for each category of watch list credits also are provided based on management s judgment of past loan loss experience and other factors 
the total of reserves resulting from this analysis is allocated reserves 
the amounts specifically provided for individual loans and pools of loans are supplemented by an unallocated amount for loan losses 
this unallocated amount is determined based on judgments regarding risk of error in the specific allocation  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  economic conditions and trends  amounts and timing of future cash flows  and other factors 
composition of allowance for loan losses this table shows an allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of the last two year ends december  december  percent of percent of loans in each loans in each category to category to amount total loans amount total loans thousands of dollars commercial  commercial re  construction agricultural real estate residential consumer special allocations unallocated total the above allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgments and is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which losses may ultimately occur 
in the allowance for loan losses approximates of loans  down slightly from in the allowance for loan losses is changed when management determines that the prospects of recovery of the principal or interest of a loan or lease are doubtful 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
real estate mortgage loans are written down to fair value upon the earlier receipt of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  upon completion of foreclosure proceedings  or upon in substance foreclosure 
commercial and other loan charge offs are made based on management s on going evaluation of non performing loans 
at year end  the bank had no impaired loans under sfas  which became effective on january  non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual  accruing loans past due days or more  and other real estate  which includes foreclosures  deeds in lieu of foreclosure and in substance foreclosures 
a loan is classified as an in substance foreclosure when the borrower has little or no equity in the collateral and the bank can reasonably expect proceeds for repayment only from the operation or sale of the collateral 
a loan generally is classified as non accrual when full collection of principal or interest is doubtful or a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
unless management determines that the estimated net realizable value of the collateral is greater than the unpaid principal and interest  interest accrual is discontinued 
unpaid interest previously credited to income in the current year is reserved  and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
a non performing loan is returned to performing status when the loan is brought current and has performed in accordance with contract terms for a period of time 
distribution of non performing assets december thousands of dollars commercial  commercial re  construction residential re installment consumer total non performing loans other real estate owned other assets debt security total non performing assets non performing loans to year end loans non performing assets to year end loans and other real estate owned management continually reviews any non performing assets and any uncollectible portions of the asset have been charged off 
when the bank has non performing assets  management strives to assure that the amounts reflected on the books fairly represent the net realizable value of that asset 
however  the time required to liquidate the asset is undeterminable due to the time required to proceed through the court systems and the time required to market the collateral 
at year ends and  there was  and  non accrual loans respectively  and consequently there was  additional interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been accruing interest 
at december   the bank had no loans  which were not included in the day past due or non accrual categories  where the borrowers are currently experiencing or have recently experienced financial difficulties but are current on their payments 
this is down from  at december  at december   the bank had no commitments to lend additional funds with respect to non performing loans 
in evaluating loan portfolio risk  management believes that any significant future increases in non performing loans are dependent to a large extent on the economic environment 
in a deteriorating or uncertain economy  management applies more conservative assumptions when assessing the future prospects of borrowers and when estimating collateral values 
this may result in a higher number of loans being classified as non performing 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in which is down from in the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to certain tax exempt interest income 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
another significant effect of inflation is on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial results is the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  the bank had commitments to originate and disperse on loans of approximately  and  respectively 
substantially all of both years figures include commitments to originate construction real estate loans and pre approved commercial lines of credit 
the bank expects that all of the commitments at december  will be exercised within the current year 
in addition  at december  and  the bank had in place letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
the bank does not expect that any of the standby letters of credit in place at december  will be exercised within the current year 
the bank had no commitments to purchase loans at december  and governance the company s audit committee is comprised of members of the board of directors excluding officers and certain other board members  who by definition  could have conflicts of interest 
the members of the audit committee all have varying levels of financial expertise  but none meet the regulatory definition of financial expert 
the company currently has no board member who qualifies as a financial expert that is eligible to serve on the audit committee 
as the holding company for a community bank  the company has chosen not to seek out board members solely for the purpose of filling this role but rather sought board members who are leaders in the community and or hold significant investment in the company 
when the board considers the nomination of new members  consideration will be given to filling the role of financial expert 
during the th quarter of the year  the board of directors of the company and the bank adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to the members of the board of directors and the officers of the company and the bank 
the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other senior financial officers of the company and the bank  specifically are subject to the code 
a copy of the code may be obtained  at no cost  by contacting angela o reilly  corporate secretary 
also  during the year  the board of directors amended the bylaws of the company eliminating the classified board system  thus changing the term of service for the directors from three years to only one year 
the previous bylaw read as follows section term of office 
the board of directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with the term of office of one class expiring each year  and at the annual meeting of shareholders in  directors of the first class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting  directors of the second class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting  and directors of the third class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting 
thereafter  at each annual meeting of shareholders  the successors to the class of directors whose terms shall then expire  shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting after such election and until their successors are elected and qualified 
when the number of directors is changed  the newly established directorships shall be apportioned among the classes so as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible 
the amended bylaw reads as follows section term of office 
directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of shareholders and shall hold office until the annual meeting next succeeding their election and until their successors are elected and qualified
