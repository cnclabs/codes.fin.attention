item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cytyc corporation designs  develops  manufactures  and markets the thinprep system and thinprep imaging system for use in medical diagnostic applications 
the thinprep system is widely used for cervical cancer screening and non gynecologic cytology 
the thinprep system consists of the thinprep pap test  thinprep processor  thinprep processor  and related reagents  filters  and other disposable supplies 
the thinprep imaging system is a device that uses computer imaging technology to assist in primary cervical cancer screening of thinprep pap test slides 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually in the case of goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
we are required to perform an impairment review annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
based on our impairment review during  the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  no impairment loss exists 
at december   we had million of intangible assets  of which million represents goodwill 
an impairment to our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of income 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
we file income tax returns in nine countries as well as many states and other localities 
we must estimate our income tax expense after considering  among other factors  differing tax rates between jurisdictions  allocation factors  tax credits  nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates 
a change in our effective income tax rate would have the effect of changing net income by approximately million  or per share 
deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
we record the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets generally result in tax deductions or credits subsequent to the period in which the related item was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred tax liabilities typically reflect a current tax deduction for which the related item has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to fully recover the carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
legal proceedings 
we are involved in various legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

results of operations years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
domestic net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of  primarily due to increased sales of our thinprep pap test 
domestic sales of our thinprep pap test increased in compared to  reflecting a more than increase in unit sales  while average selling prices increased slightly 
sales to our two largest customers  quest diagnostics  inc and laboratory corporation of america  accounted for of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in we believe the rate of growth in net sales increased in compared to in part due to changes in inventory management by some of our laboratory customers in  which impacted their ordering patterns during that year 
international net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of  reflecting both increased unit sales and average pricing of the thinprep pap test internationally  as well as the favorable impact of the weaker us dollar on sales in foreign currencies 
we believe we are seeing growing acceptance of our thinprep pap test in the international market  as evidenced by the growth in our international sales and the adoption of liquid based cytology the testing technique underlying the thinprep pap test as the primary means of processing samples for cervical cell screening in england  wales and scotland 
gross profit increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
the gross margin increased to in as compared to for the increase related primarily to the increased volume of shipments and higher average selling price during of our thinprep pap test 
total operating expenses increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
operating expenses for included a one time charge of million to write off costs related to the terminated merger with digene corporation 
the primary contributors to the increase in operating expenses in were sales and marketing costs  which increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
this increase reflects both market development and customer training costs associated with the thinprep imaging system  which was released to market following fda approval in june in addition  we increased our efforts towards developing the market and customer base for the thinprep pap test on an international basis  which contributed to the growth in international sales during the period 
the increase also reflects the impact of the weaker us dollar on international sales and marketing expenditures 
our research and development costs remained relatively consistent between and  increasing slightly to million in from million for  as savings from lower product development and regulatory efforts following the release of the thinprep imaging system were offset by an increased investment in enhancements to our existing product technologies 
for example  during we initiated collaborative research agreements with harvard medical school and northeastern university  which may translate into further improvements to our testing platforms for cervical  breast and other forms of cancer 
during the past three years  our research and development costs have been related primarily to the thinprep imaging system  the firstcyte breast test and enhancements to our existing product technologies 
from its release in june through december   revenues recognized related to the thinprep imaging system  which have been placed at customer sites under use plan agreements where revenue is recognized over the term of the use plan agreement  were less than one percent of total revenues 
revenues on sales of the firstcyte breast test during the years ended december   and were less than one percent of total revenues 
we continue to gather clinical data to support significant commercialization of this product 
our research and development expenditures also included enhancements to the thinprep processor  our batch processing system 
while revenues from the sale of the thinprep processor were approximately one percent of total revenues in and less than one percent of total revenues in and  we believe the use of these processors by our customers has supported the growth in sales of the thinprep pap test over the past three years 
general and administrative costs increased to million in from million for  an increase of  largely due to increased business insurance and personnel related expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to of revenues in from for interest income decreased to million in from million for  a decrease of  due primarily to lower interest rates and a lower cash balance available for investment 
our effective tax rate for increased to  compared to for the increase is primarily due to a reduction in research and development credits as a percentage of our taxable income 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate in will decrease slightly to due to savings following reorganization of our operations in years ended december  and december  net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
domestic net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of  primarily due to increased sales of our thinprep pap test for cervical cancer screening 
domestic sales of our thinprep pap test increased in compared to  primarily reflecting an increase in unit sales  offset in part by a slight decrease in average selling prices related to customer mix 
sales to our largest customer  quest diagnostics  inc  accounted for of net sales in both and sales to our second largest customer  laboratory corporation of america  accounted for of net sales in  compared to less than of net sales in we believe the rate of growth in net sales decreased in compared to due primarily to changes in inventory management by some of our laboratory customers  which impacted their ordering patterns during international net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
gross profit increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
the gross margin decreased to in as compared to for the decrease related primarily to sales promotion discounts and to a lesser extent a larger percentage of total revenue with international customers who have lower average selling prices 
total operating expenses decreased to million in from million for  a decrease of 
operating expenses in included a one time charge of million to write off costs related to the terminated merger with digene corporation 
operating expenses in included a one time charge of million to write off the portion of the purchase price of pro duct health  inc pro duct allocated to in process research and development projects 
the in process research and development projects related primarily to plans for clinical studies and continued development of the firstcyte breast test catheter 
these clinical studies have been subsumed into other projects and development of the next generation catheter is nearing completion 
the primary contributor to the increase in operating expenses in were sales and marketing costs  which increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects expenses associated with expansion of international subsidiaries  us sales force meeting and travel expenses and personnel costs to develop the market and customer base for the firstcyte breast test 
at the same time  our research and development costs decreased to million in from million for  a decrease of  primarily as a result of lower engineering costs associated with our thinprep imaging system development activities 
general and administrative costs increased to million in from million for  an increase of  primarily due to a combination of increased personnel costs and professional fees in our infrastructure departments  which grew to support our business 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in from for interest income decreased to million in from million for  a decrease of  due primarily to lower interest rates 
we also recorded million during in other income relating to the settlement of litigation with tripath imaging  inc please refer to note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information regarding this settlement 
our effective tax rate for was 
our effective tax rate for was  due primarily to the nondeductible in process research and development charge related to the pro duct acquisition  partially offset by release of the valuation allowance related to certain of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
as a result of our sustained profitability  we determined that the realization of our net deferred tax assets was more likely than not and  accordingly  eliminated the valuation allowance in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities totaling million 
cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in the decrease in cash flows from operations in as compared to primarily reflects an increase in receivables in the fourth quarter of as well as an investment in inventory during to support the existing demand for the thinprep imaging system released in june and purchases of key  sole source components 
our net accounts receivable increased to million at december  as compared to million at december   reflecting the effects of an million increase in fourth quarter sales in versus at the same time  our days sales outstanding remained relatively flat at days and we have had no significant issues of collectibility 
the term days sales outstanding  which we calculate by dividing gross trade accounts receivable at the end of the period by our average daily consolidated net sales for the quarter  refers to roughly the number of days worth of sales that are outstanding and unpaid at any given time 
our inventory increased to million at december   as compared to million at december   to support the growth in our sales  timely deployment of the thinprep imaging system and to ensure the availability of key raw materials 
our investing activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of million in net proceeds from the sale of investment securities  offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures during included the cost of opening a new distribution facility and developing redundant manufacturing capabilities 
our investing activities during and used cash of million and million  respectively 
these investing activities included capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
investing activities in also included the purchase of pro duct for net cash of million 
during  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million  which include improvements to certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as other machinery and equipment purchases to support the growth in our business 
our financing activities in and used cash of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock  partially funded by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan 
in and  we repurchased million and million of our common stock  respectively 
our board of directors has authorized  in the aggregate  up to million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock  plus the cost of purchasing additional shares in an amount equal to the number of shares issued to our stock option holders upon exercise of their stock options 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for cash totaling million  with an average price paid of per share 
our future contractual cash obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases      inventory purchase commitments     total contractual cash obligations     our operating lease obligations relate primarily to our facilities  but also include certain automobiles and office equipment outside of the united states 
these operating leases have expiration dates ranging from through the operating lease obligations in the table above include a lease we entered into in january for certain facilities in marlborough  massachusetts with a term of years 
in addition to operating leases  we have also entered into certain long term supply contracts with remaining terms of up to nine years to assure continuity of supply of certain key components and raw materials while maintaining high quality and reliability 
in certain of these contracts  a minimum purchase commitment has been established 
our inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating cash needs  including capital expenditures  lease and purchase commitments and tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements apart from the operating leases described above 
recent accounting pronouncement in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expanded the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business entity  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities which include  but are not limited to  special purpose entities  or spes to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the adoption of this portion of fin has not had any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
this interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before february  we do not have any investments or arrangements which would be considered variable interest  and believe that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
we do not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments 
all of our investments are in short term  investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and investment securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our business outside the united states is conducted in local currencies 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign hedging arrangements 
we estimate that any market risk associated with our foreign operations is not significant and is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
