item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a global distributor of chemically derived pharmaceuticals  biopharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals 
our offices in china  germany  france  the netherlands  singapore  india  poland  hong kong  the united kingdom and the united states  along with warehouses worldwide  enable us to respond quickly to global customer demands  assuring that a consistent  high quality supply of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and specialty chemicals is never far away 
we are able to offer our customers very competitive pricing  continuity of supply  and quality control 
our years of experience  our reputation for reliability and stability  and our long term relationships with our suppliers has fostered loyalty among our customers 
we remain confident about our short and long term business prospects 
in the short term  we anticipate continued organic growth  including growth resulting from our launching four new active pharmaceutical ingredients apis per year  entering the developing biopharmaceutical market  globalization of our chemicals colorants business  expansion of our agrochemical segment by acquisition of product lines  continued enhancement of our sourcing operations in china and india  and steady improvement of our regulatory capabilities 
we believe new product launches and product introductions demonstrate that aceto has come to be recognized by the worldwide generic pharmaceutical industry as a reliable supplier 
our long term plans involve seeking strategic acquisitions that enhance our earnings  forming alliances with partners that add to our capabilities  and establishing significant business operations in eastern europe 
we believe eastern europe has great potential in the api business  given that entry of eastern european countries into the european union will result in their being subject to the same strict pharmaceutical regulations as their western european counterparts 
we are reporting net sales of  for the year ended june   which represents a increase over the  reported in fiscal the gross profit margin of for the year represents the highest gross profit margin ever recorded by aceto 
the strong sales and gross profit margin caused our net income to increase to  or per diluted share  which is higher than fiscal for the year ended june   we reported net sales of  resulting in net income of  or per diluted share 
our financial position as of june  remains strong  as we had cash of  working capital of  no long term debt and shareholders equity of  aceto s business is separated into four principal segments health sciences  chemicals colorants  agrochemicals  and institutional sanitary supplies other 
the health sciences segment is aceto s largest and fastest growing segment both in sales and gross profits 
this segment is comprised of apis  pharmaceutical intermediates  diagnostic chemicals and nutritional supplements 
apis comprise about of this segment s revenues 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we have an extensive pipeline of new generic products poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and europe and expect to launch a minimum of four each year 
in addition  as new members join the european union  primarily from eastern europe  they become subject to the same regulatory standards as their western europe counterparts 
with the opening of our office in poland in january  we are well positioned to take advantage of that opportunity 
the chemicals colorants segment supplies chemicals used in the color producing industries such as textiles  ink  paper and coatings  as well as chemicals used in plastic  resins  adhesives  coatings  food  flavor additives  and the production of agrochemicals 
our sales of these products are predominantly in the united states and purchases are primarily from china and western europe 
the agrochemicals segment  while relatively small in terms of sales  is our most profitable in terms of gross margin percentages 
our revenues are derived from sales of herbicides  pesticides  etc  primarily in the united states and western europe 
our joint venture with nufarm  which will market butoxone r to increase our market share of the peanut  soybean and alfalfa herbicide commenced operations in april we believe this will have a marginally positive effect on the gross margins contribution in this segment 
value added core competencies aceto s main strengths are sourcing  regulatory support and quality control 
we are currently the largest buyer of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different factories 
among aceto s greatest strengths are our people and the ability they have to meet the individual needs of customers 
eighty five of aceto s approximately employees have technical degrees and aceto has eighteen employees whose exclusive responsibility is regulatory compliance 
this enables aceto to dispatch highly skilled professionals whenever they might be needed 
in this section  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including the following o factors that affect our business o our earnings and costs in the periods presented o changes in earnings and costs between periods o sources of earnings o the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this section  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
significant transactions in fiscal we completed two significant transactions in fiscal these transactions are consistent with our strategy of seeking strategic acquisitions that enhance earnings and forming alliances with partners that add to our capabilities 
on december   through our wholly owned subsidiary aceto holding gmbh aceto holding  we acquired from corange deutschland holding gmbh corange  all of the capital stock of pharma waldhof beteiligungs gmbh pharma waldhof  and all of the partnership interest of pharma waldhof gmbh co 
kg 
pharma waldhof is the general partner of pharma waldhof gmbh co 
kg 
based in dusseldorf  germany  pharma waldhof gmbh co 
kg distributes biologically and chemically derived apis used in therapeutic and diagnostic products 
it is a worldwide provider of a patent protected  biologically derived api used for a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic heart medication 
its primary customers include worldwide ethical and generic pharmaceutical companies 
our acquisition of pharma waldhof added value for aceto on several levels by o immediately enhancing our earnings o spearheading our entry into the biopharmaceuticals market o broadening our product offerings in chemically derived apis o strengthening our stance as an early participant in the developing generic biopharmaceutical business o fostering a continuing relationship between aceto and roche diagnostic gmbh roche  whereby roche will continue to manufacture the principal biopharmaceutical apis that pharma waldhof distributes and provide certain other services 
we paid for the capital stock of pharma waldhof and  for the partnership interest of pharma waldhof gmbh co 
kg 
additionally  the share purchase agreement states that we are to pay the seller an amount equal to certain acquired assets less certain acquired liabilities 
we originally estimated this additional payment to be further negotiations between aceto and corange regarding this provision of the share purchase agreement took place in april  and as a result we agreed to pay corange  for those assets less those liabilities 
we continued the business of pharma waldhof and successfully integrated that business into our business during the second half of fiscal on november   our wholly owned subsidiary aceto agricultural chemicals corp 
aceto agricultural formed a joint venture with nufarm americas inc nufarm  a subsidiary of australia based nufarm limited with each party owning 
the joint venture entity is named srfa  llc 
aceto agricultural and nufarm have acquired an epa label for butoxone r  an herbicide used on peanuts  soybeans and alfalfa 
aceto agricultural previously marketed this herbicide under a different label  db 
going forward  aceto agricultural and nufarm intend to market the herbicide in the united states solely under the butoxone r label  which has greater market penetration than  db 
nufarm will continue to formulate the product 
srfa commenced operations in april in accordance with fasb interpretation r fin r  aceto consolidated srfa in fiscal the minority interest of in the earnings of srfa is reflected in interest and other income  net  in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  this joint venture should have little effect on our working capital requirements as we previously sold this product under a different epa label 
this joint venture reflects our strategy for expanding our agrochemical business  which is to partner with large agrochemical manufacturers and distributors to capitalize on the rapid consolidation of the industry 
due to this consolidation  there remain a limited number of significant manufacturers of crop protection products 
we believe this consolidation trend will continue  forcing the large distributors to find alternative sources 
we will look to asian producers to meet our needs in this area 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  environmental and other contingencies  pension benefits and income taxes 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts  and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives consist primarily of volume incentive rebates 
we record such volume incentive rebates as the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate are recorded  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and industries in which the customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  trademarks  purchased customer lists  and covenants not to compete 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective july  as required by sfas  upon adoption we performed impairment tests on goodwill as of july  as a result of the impairment tests  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  which has been included as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  also required by sfas  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  a third party valuation firm is used  as necessary  to help us evaluate recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the recoverability of long lived assets aggregating  including goodwill of at june  in the institutional sanitary supplies other segment is predicated on the market acceptance of the launch of new products 
if the actual revenue and profit results of these product launches are less than anticipated  we may be required to record an impairment on the goodwill and or other long lived assets of this segment 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits in addition to our defined contribution plan in the united states  we sponsor pension plans outside the united states covering fourteen employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate the probability and magnitude of future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these variables 
the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may significantly affect the amount of pension expense and liability that we record 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of  and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting to have sufficient future earnings in order to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability

fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with  for the prior year 
we reported particularly strong sales and gross profit for the year ended june  for the health sciences segment  as explained below 
net sales for the other three segments combined increased  or in fiscal health sciences the health sciences segment reported a significant increase in sales and accounted for of the overall increase in this segment has achieved gains in market share and experienced strong demand for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis launched during fiscal and this segment s sales were  for fiscal versus  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the improvement in revenue was an increase of  attributable to follow up shipments of several apis that were launched in fiscal and sold to companies that had received approval to market these products 
some of these increases were offset  however  by a decrease in sales volume of one api  which had sales of  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal this represents an example of the possible life cycle of a generic pharmaceutical product the product launch period can be followed by a reduction in volume once the initial distribution channels are filled 
the segment increase can also be attributed to the overall increase in sales volume from our foreign subsidiaries of  net of the increase in follow up api sales mentioned above 
the foreign subsidiaries increased sales is attributed to the acquisition of pharma waldhof which contributed  of the increase  the effect of foreign currency rate changes due to the strengthening of the euro  an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier  sales from new products and improved market penetration 
the nutritionals product line within this segment reported an increase of  or over fiscal  primarily due to increased demand for two products within our nutritional supplements offering 
we expect continued strong demand for these two products in the near term 
chemicals colorants in fiscal  the chemicals colorants segment achieved an increase of  or  to  compared to  in fiscal last year s sales included a favorable adjustment from a negotiated settlement for the lost gross margin regarding non performance of a sales contract 
sales were up  or when this adjustment is excluded from last year s sales 
the segment s increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of  from our foreign subsidiaries 
one large customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediates business purchased  less product in fiscal than in fiscal this loss was offset by increases of  within the aroma chemicals  food and beverage  miscellaneous intermediates and solvents categories 
agrochemicals agrochemicals sales were  for compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
the increase in sales was due primarily to the introduction of three new products totaling  and increased sales of butoxone r from our joint venture with nufarm americas of institutional sanitary supplies other institutional sanitary supplies other sales were  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of or 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased in fiscal  to  from  reported in fiscal the health sciences segment made the largest contribution to this increase as it accounted for  or of the overall increase 
health sciences in fiscal  the health science segment s gross profit was  or of net sales in fiscal versus  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was largely attributable to follow up shipments of several apis that were launched in fiscal and provided a  or increase over last year at gross margin rates that were slightly lower than in the previous year 
additionally  our european operations contributed  additional gross profit  net of the increase of follow up apis mentioned in net sales  due to increased volume of new and existing products  improved market penetration and an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier for new products in existing and new markets 
these increases in gross profit were substantially offset by lower sales and gross profit  decrease attributable to our highest sales volume api during the prior year 
gross profit for the nutritional products was or higher than the prior year  with slightly lower gross margin rates 
chemicals colorants the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit of  in fiscal represents an increase of  or over last year s gross profit of  gross margin increased to this year versus in the prior year 
the gross profit realized from initial sales from our foreign subsidiaries contributed  of the segment s overall increase 
the increased sales of  in the categories mentioned in net sales accounted for additional gross profit of gross margin rates increased due to a  decrease in sales to one major customer whose sales have generated lower than normal margins  along with an overall improvement in margins across other categories due to changes in product mix and some instances of improved pricing 
agrochemicals the agrochemicals segment s gross profit of  in fiscal represents an increase of  or  versus gross profit of  in the prior year 
gross margin increased to for fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit resulted from the introduction of three new products  the increased contribution from butoxone r  and the recovery of cost on the sale of previously marked down inventory 
in addition  last year s gross profit was reduced by an unusually large increase in packaging costs due to a change in the way a specific product was applied 
such costs did not recur in fiscal institutional sanitary supplies and other institutional sanitary supplies and other gross profits were  or in versus  or in unallocated cost of sales remained flat at  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a less than increase 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges and increased sales and shipments to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal sg a increased primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the strengthening of the euro in our euro zone operations  the acquisition of pharma waldhof  increases in professional fees  including internal control documentation and assessment as mandated by the sarbanes oxley legislation  and legal fees related to recent business agreements  product registration fees and the dismissal of a lawsuit related to a former supplier and ongoing litigation 
we sold certain real estate in fiscal and realized a net gain of on the sale 
this gain reduced overall sg a and lowered sg a as a percentage of sales 
excluding this transaction  sg a as a percentage of sales would have been last year 
operating income in fiscal operating income was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to the overall increase in gross profit of  which was partially offset by the  increase in sg a expenses 
interest and other income expense interest expense for fiscal was versus in the prior year 
the decrease was due to lower average borrowings 
interest and other income increased to  for fiscal compared to in fiscal this was partly attributable to the increase to in fiscal from in fiscal in the annual government subsidy we receive for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china 
also  we recognized an unrealized gain on marketable securities of in fiscal versus an unrealized loss of in fiscal in addition  we recognized gains on foreign currency of in fiscal versus in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to increased earnings in lower foreign tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended june  compared with  for the prior year 
we reported particularly strong sales and gross profit for the year ended june  by our health sciences segment as explained below 
net sales for the other three segments combined were up  or in fiscal health sciences the health sciences segment reported a significant increase in sales and accounted for of the overall increase 
this segment has achieved gains in market share and experienced strong demand for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis of products launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the four quarters of fiscal this segment s sales were  for the year ended june  versus  last year  an increase of  or 
the majority of the increase or  resulted from the initial and or follow up shipments of five apis launched during the period from the fall of through june these generic pharmaceutical products are sold to companies that have received recent approval to market these products 
the heavy sales volume for one generic pharmaceutical product during fiscal resulted in sales of  the demand for the product was related to a stockpiling of certain products by the us government in connection with the threat of terrorist attacks after the tragic events of september  these sales were not repeated in fiscal the health sciences segment s european operations achieved an increase in sales of  which was attributable to two new major customers  several new products and an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier in europe which allows for the sale of additional products into new markets 
the nutritionals product line within this segment showed an increase of  or over fiscal due to increased demand for products such as nutritional supplements 
chemicals colorants the chemicals colorants segment achieved an increase of  or  to  in compared to  last year 
the segment s increase is attributable to an increase in volume of  with one large customer and some improved volume and pricing in dye intermediates which accounted for an increase of sales of  these increases were substantially offset by a decrease in volume of  in pigments and pigment intermediates due to decreased demand and competitive pricing pressures  the loss of a large volume customer and a significant decrease in volume of two products which caused sales in our organic chemicals category to decline by  from fiscal to the termination of a distribution relationship with a major supplier was the primary cause for sales to decline by  in products such as foundry chemicals  and aroma and flavor chemicals 
our food products reported sales declines of due to competitive pricing pressures 
agrochemicals agrochemicals sales were  for compared to  last year  an increase of or 
a restructuring of the company s arrangement with a third party  effective october   resulted in additional sales of during the quarter ended september  excluding this  sales increased by or 
sales were flat due to a one time sale of off grade material to one customer recorded in of offset by an overall increase in volume in fiscal for the segment s main products 
institutional sanitary supplies other institutional sanitary supplies other sales were  for compared to  last year  an increase of or 
the improved sales were attributable to price increases and identifying better sources of supply that have improved our competitive position regarding pricing 
during  this segment was also specifically disrupted by the after effects on the economy from the terrorist attacks of september  over of this segment s customer base is in the new york metropolitan area 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased  to  from  the health sciences segment made the largest contribution to the overall improvement as it accounted for  or of the overall increase 
health sciences the gross profit resulting from the health sciences segment amounted to  or in fiscal versus  or  in the prior year 
gross profit improvement was mainly attributable to the sales of the five apis as described above in the sales comments 
these products provided  or of the segment s increase in gross profit dollars 
the blended gross margin rates for the five apis was in fiscal versus in fiscal the reduction in the margin rates is due to price erosion as these products mature during the later stages of their launch period 
the positive impact of the five apis was partially offset by a  reduction in gross profit from the segment s highest volume product in fiscal this product generated a  gross profit in at a rate 
since this product saw only minimal sales in  its lower than usual margin rate helped to reflect an improved margin rate in fiscal as these sales were replaced with higher margin sales 
another factor contributing to the gross profit improvement in the health sciences segment was the gross profit dollars generated from the increased sales volume from the expanded distribution agreement in europe in addition to new products and new customers were the primary factors that contributed to an increase of  in fiscal in the segment s european market 
gross margins improved in fiscal to of sales versus in due to contributions from new products and overall product mix 
our nutritionals products generated an additional in gross profit over fiscal while its gross margin rates remained constant at in versus in chemicals colorants the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit of  decreased or over last year s  gross profit  as a percentage of sales  declined to this year versus in the prior year 
the current year s gross profit includes the net benefit of a negotiated settlement for lost gross profit regarding non performance of a sales contract and an estimate of a loss on the related purchase contract in the amount of the decrease in gross profit excluding this favorable settlement would have been  or 
the gross profit rate for this year would have been excluding the settlement versus a rate in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit rate is primarily a result of increased sales volume of  from one large customer at substantially lower than usual gross profit rates for this segment combined with continued erosion of margins and gross profit dollars in various business sectors due to competitive pricing pressures  a strengthening euro which increased product costs  and economic sluggishness 
the loss of a large sales volume customer in addition to the loss of a major supplier and its negative impact on our related customers in early fiscal also contributed to the decrease in gross profit dollars 
agrochemicals the agrochemicals segment showed a decrease in gross profit of or from  in fiscal versus  last year 
the decrease in gross profit dollars resulted from increased packaging costs of and overall product mix offset by an increase in sales volume 
gross margin was in fiscal versus last year 
gross margin decreased in fiscal due to the increased packaging costs and the blend of the product mix over the two periods 
institutional sanitary supplies and other institutional sanitary supplies and other gross profits were  or in versus  or in the increase in gross profit dollars is mainly a result of a increase in sales 
overall product mix and price increases were the main reasons for the higher margins this year 
unallocated cost of sales increased to  from  or 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges  increased sales and shipments to customers and higher amounts of inventory in warehouses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal sg a increased primarily due to rising business insurance costs  increased selling expenses  increased development and quality assurance expenses  an increase in an environmental remediation accrual  overall increases in employee wages and incentive compensation  and increased fringe benefit costs 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in amortization expense of goodwill of as goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas the company sold property held for sale in july and realized a net gain on the sale of this gain reduced sg a expenses and lowered its sg a as a percentage of sales 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  excluding this transaction  would have been versus last year 
operating income for the year ended june  operating income was  compared to  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to the overall increase in gross profit of  with the main contribution of  coming from the health sciences segment  which was partially offset by higher sg a expenses of  interest and other income expense interest expense for fiscal was versus in the prior year 
the decrease of or was attributable to the lower levels of short term bank loans and acquisition related debt from the schweizerhall pharma acquisition and lower average interest rates 
short term bank loans was  at june  versus  at june  there was no acquisition related debt remaining as of june  and interest and other income increased to for fiscal compared to last year 
interest income increased this year due to higher average balances in interest bearing accounts and increased finance charges received from a major customer 
miscellaneous sources of other income realized an increase of in versus the prior year 
this was offset by a reduction in dividend income of and a loss on marketable securities of this year compared to a loss of in the prior year 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended june  decreased to from last year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a reflection of increased earnings in lower foreign tax jurisdictions compared to the prior year 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the year ended june  includes a one time charge of  or per diluted share  attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s  one time charge was related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with cdc products corp 
cdc which is part of our institutional sanitary supply segment 
the one time charge for cdc was due to the change in methodologies used to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill as required under sfas liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash  in short term investments and no short term bank loans 
working capital was  at june  versus  at june  our cash position at june  increased  from the june  level 
operating activities provided cash of  primarily from net income of  increases in drafts and acceptances payable of  and accounts payable and accrued purchases totaling  partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable of  investing activities used cash of  of which  was used for the acquisition of pharma waldhof 
financing activities used cash of  primarily as a result of payments of cash dividends of  and payments of short term bank loans of  which were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  credit facilities we have credit facilities with two european financial institutions 
these facilities provide us with a line of credit of  euros approximately  which was not utilized as of june  we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
in june  we amended our revolving credit agreement with a financial institution so that it expires june  and provides for available credit of  at june   we had utilized  in letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
under the credit agreement  we may obtain credit through direct borrowings and letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by of the capital of certain of our non domestic subsidiaries 
there is no borrowing base on the credit agreement 
interest under the credit agreement is at libor plus 
the credit agreement contains several covenants requiring  among other things  minimum levels of debt service and tangible net worth 
we are also subject to certain restrictive debt covenants  including covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on cash dividends  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
we were not in compliance with certain restrictive covenants at june   for which we received waivers 
working capital outlook working capital was  at june  versus  at june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to cash generated from operations 
we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  borrowing capacity and access to the equity capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures and the anticipated continuation of semi annual cash dividends 
further  we may obtain additional credit facilities to enhance our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments and contingencies we have no material financial commitments other than those under operating lease agreements  letters of credit and unconditional purchase obligations 
we have certain contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments which will impact our short and long term liquidity 
at june   we had no significant obligations for capital expenditures 
at june   contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments are as follows payments due and or amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years operating leases      commercial letters of credit   standby letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations a   total      a as of june   we had outstanding purchase obligations totaling  with suppliers to our germany  netherlands and singapore operations to acquire certain products for resale to customers 
such purchase obligations are based on anticipated sales to specific customers through march  other significant commitments and contingencies include the following effective december  we modified our non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan 
the plan is a deferred compensation plan intended to provide certain executives with supplemental retirement benefits beyond our k plan  as well as to permit additional deferral of a portion of their compensation 
all compensation deferred under the plan is held by us in a grantor trust  which is considered an asset of the company 
we had a liability under the plan of  and the funds held by the grantor trust amounted to  as of june one of our subsidiaries markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the environmental protection agency epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate the generation of new test data to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
we are presently a member of two such task force groups and may be required to make additional payments in the future 
we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know the impact the final resolution of these matters will have on our results of operations or liquidity in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
in june  we entered into a software license and support agreement that provides a non exclusive license to use the vendor s software for a fully integrated enterprise resource planning system 
we are obligated to make aggregate payments of approximately such payments are expected to be made in fiscal related party transactions certain directors of the company are affiliated with law firms which serve as counsel to the company on various corporate matters

the fees charged by such firms were at rates comparable to rates obtainable from other firms for similar services 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an exposure draft entitled share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this exposure draft would require stock based compensation to employees to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of the stock options 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock awards  the fair value of the stock options would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the option  the expected term of the option  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the proposed requirements in the exposure draft would be effective for the first fiscal year beginning after december  the fasb intends to issue a final statement in late we will continue to monitor communications on this subject from the fasb in order to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation r fin r  a revision to interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r  which clarifies some of the provisions of fin and exempts certain entities from its requirements  sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
these provisions are based on the general premise that if a company controls another entity through interests other than voting interests  that company should consolidate the controlled entity 
the provisions of fin r were effective on march  we have evaluated whether the provisions of fin r are applicable to our investments  as well as other arrangements  which may meet the criteria of the interpretation  and concluded that srfa  a owned joint venture that commenced operations in april  meets the definition of a variable interest entity and based on the provisions of fin r  has been included in the our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market price  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market price risk we had short term investments at june  of they consisted solely of corporate securities  were recorded at fair value  and had exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would not be material as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june  was not material 
in addition  we also enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to reduce foreign currency exposure on inter company transactions 
in june we entered into a one year cross currency interest rate swap transaction and in may we entered into a five year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  both for the purpose of hedging fixed interest rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under inter company loans 
under the terms of these derivative financial instruments  us dollar fixed principal and interest payments to be received under inter company loans will be swapped for euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments 
the change in fair value of the swaps from date of purchase to june  was 
the gains or losses on the inter company loans due to changes in foreign currency rates will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
since our interest rate swaps qualify as hedging activities  the change in their fair value amounting to and in and  respectively  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro and the singapore dollars 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations
