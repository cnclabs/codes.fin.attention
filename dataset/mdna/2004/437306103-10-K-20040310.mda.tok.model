the company is engaged primarily in the ownership  management acquisition  rehabilitation and development of residential apartmen t communities in the northeastern  mid atlantic and midwester n united states 
as of december   the company operated apartment communities with  apartments 
of this total  th e company owned communities  consisting of  apartments managed as general partner partnerships that owned  apartments  and fee managed  apartments for affiliates and thir d parties 
executive summary the company continued to operate during in a difficult economi c environment 
the recession  which started in  continued throug h resulting in job losses in many parts of the country 
a reductio n of job growth leads to fewer household formations  which creates a reduction in demand for rental housing 
in addition  the low interes t rate environment made it more challenging to compete for potentia l residents who considered making the switch to home ownership 
a s referenced in our market demographics table on page of this report job growth for our markets improved slightly in with growt h over as there is usually a lag between job growth and househol d formation  this slight recovery did not create increased demand fo r our apartments 
we ended at only occupancy for core properties and  with n o increased demand and a weak winter leasing season  we experienced ou r worst quarter ever as measured by occupancy  with core propertie s occupancy of during the first quarter of during  the company s strategy was to maximize rental rate growt h by being aggressive with rent increases even if it resulted in a reduction in occupancy 
with leading indicators suggesting that th e economy had bottomed out and was positioned for a recovery  th e company decided in to position itself to improve occupancy 
thi s resulted in less aggressive rental rate increases and a greater use o f rent concessions to achieve this objective 
although occupancies at core properties for increased onl y slightly by basis points  from to  the company was wel l positioned by the end of occupancies in the fourth quarter o f averaged  compared to a year ago 
the company uses a measurement referred to as available to rent  or atr 
this is a leading indicator to assess future occupancy rates by reference t o units which will be available for rent  based upon leases signed o r termination notices received relating to future move in move ou t dates 
at the end of january   our atr was  which compare s favorably to january   when atr was 
ending the year with higher occupancies  as well as positiv e comparison for atr  led to the company s guidance suggesting core properties apartment units owned throughout and rental growth of 
rental rates are projected to increase including above average rental increases at certain communitie s resulting from the continued efforts to upgrade the properties occupancies are expected to pick up for the year  mostly due t o positive comparisons to the first two quarters of which were ver y weak 
finally  the pricing power resulting from improved occupancie s support the belief that we will slow down concession activity  addin g to net rental income 
expenses for core properties are projected to increase 
se e below under results of operations for more details on expens e comparisons 
these revenue and expense projections result in core propertie s net operating income noi growth of at the mid point of guidance 
markets where the company expects above average noi growt h include washington  dc  hudson valley  long islan d  northern new jersey  and boston 
baltimore i s expected to be closer to the average at noi growth 
markets wit h below average noi growth expectations include philadelphia upstate new york rochester  buffalo and syracuse at  detroi t  and chicago 
certain historical demographi c information for these markets may be found in the table on page o f this report 
of the two items making up noi rental revenue and operatin g expenses  the revenue component is likely to be more volatile 
a n improving economy could create higher demand for rental housing abov e that projected 
an economic recovery that creates little new jo b growth  coupled with a continuation of low interest rates  could pu t pressure on the company s ability to reach the mid point of guidance the company has given ffo guidance for with a range of t o per share 
the company has anticipated closing on acquisitions of million i n its budget for the company is committed to a discipline d approach to acquisitions  but at the same time recognizes tha t unprecedented low interest rate levels allow the company flexibilit y to adjust hurdle rates and bids to reflect market conditions 
th e company has traditionally kept leverage at about of total equit y market capitalization 
to facilitate acquisition activity in th e current market  the board decided in february to give managemen t the flexibility to increase leverage to enhance the ability to secur e prime acquisition opportunities 
while the acquisition market wil l likely continue to be very competitive  the company is confident tha t the acquisition goal of million is achievable based on th e current acquisition pipeline and the board s decision to increas e leverage 
during  the company anticipates increasing leverage to a level o f approximately of debt to total market capitalization in order t o meet the above described acquisition goals 
in addition  with only of its debt bearing interest at variable rates at december  the company plans on increasing exposure to variable rate debt 
thi s will be achieved mostly through the use of the existing line o f credit  approaching a level of just under of outstandin g indebtedness bearing interest at variable rates 
finally  although no t contemplated based on the announced level of acquisitions of million  if the acquisition pace were to increase  the company woul d consider a combination of increased sales of under performing o r isolated apartment communities and issuance of cumulative redeemabl e preferred stock to raise additional capital 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december the company owned communities with  apartment unit s throughout and where comparable operating results ar e available for the years presented the core properties 
fo r the year ended december   the core properties showed a n increase in rental revenues of and a net operating incom e decrease of over the year end period 
property leve l operating expenses increased 
average economic occupancy for th e core properties increased from to  with averag e monthly rental rates increasing to per apartment unit 
a summary of the core property net operating income is a s follows change change rent   property other income   total revenue   operating and maintenance   net operating income   during  the company acquired a total of apartment units i n two newly acquired communities the acquisition communities in addition  the company experienced a full year results for the  apartment units in twenty apartment communities the acquisitio n communities acquired during the inclusion of these acquire d communities generally accounted for the significant changes i n operating results for the year ended december  a summary of the net operating income from continuing operations fo r the company as a whole is as follows change change rent   property other income   total revenue   operating and maintenance   net operating income   during  the company also disposed of seven properties with a total of  units  which had partial results for the disposed communities

for the year ended december   income from continuin g operations income before equity in earnings losses o f unconsolidated affiliates  minority interest  discontinued operation s and gain loss on disposition of property and business decreased b y  when compared to the year ended december  th e decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors a n increase in operating and maintenance expense of  a n increase in general and administrative expense of  a n increase in interest expense of  and an increase i n depreciation and amortization of  these changes wer e partially offset by a decrease of  in all other expens e items  an increase in rental income of  and an increase i n all other income of  each of the expense items is describe d in more detail below 
of the  increase in rental income   i s attributable to the acquisition communities and  i s attributable to the acquisition communities 
the balance o f  relates to a increase from the core propertie s due primarily to an increase of in weighted average rental rates accompanied by an increase in average economic occupancy from t o as referenced in executive summary above  the company focused mor e on improving occupancy during and therefore was less aggressiv e with rent increases at its core properties 
an additional component o f the increase in weighted average rent results from th e significant upgrading and repositioning efforts discussed unde r capital improvements below 
the company seeks a minimum interna l rate of return for these revenue enhancing upgrades 
in the current economic environment  it is very difficult to projec t rental rate and occupancy results 
the company has provided guidanc e for  which  at the mid point of the range  anticipates same stor e revenue growth of  including above average rental increases fro m the continued efforts to upgrade the properties 
occupancy levels ar e expected to remain consistent with the end of the fourth quarter o f  producing an expected average for core properties of property other income  which consists primarily of income fro m operation of laundry facilities  late charges  administrative fees garage and carport rentals  net profits from corporate apartments cable revenue  pet charges  and miscellaneous charges to residents increased in by  of this increase   i s attributable to the acquisition communities   i s attributable to the acquisition communities  and  represents a increase attributable to the core properties the increase represents a higher level of corporate leases in which produce a higher level of ancillary income 
interest and dividend income decreased in by  due t o decreased levels of financing to affiliates as a result of th e company s disposition of its interests in various affordable housin g communities and a lower interest rate environment 
other income  which primarily reflects management and other rea l estate service fees recognized by the company  increased in b y  this is the direct result of the consolidation of th e management companies effective january  in and prior  th e share of the combined loss from the management companies was include d in the line item equity in earnings losses of unconsolidate d affiliates

for the heatin g season  the company s negotiated average price per decatherm i s approximately 
a year ago  the average commodity cost for th e season s contracts was 
while the company s costs are up  the y are well below the january strip price of for the same tim e frame 
the company has provided guidance for which anticipates a increase in natural gas heating costs 
this is based on th e thirty year average for the number of degrees days for  increase d to reflect a much colder than normal january the increase in repairs and maintenance of occurred in contrac t repairs  painting and cleaning 
the timing of contract repairs ar e somewhat unpredictable 
a new marketing strategy for many of ou r regions included a two tone  custom paint selection  which drove u p costs  but may have helped to capture a higher percentage of potentia l resident traffic 
this custom painting strategy has been discontinue d for the company has provided guidance for which anticipate s a more normalized increase in repairs and maintenance 
personnel expense was up in versus the harsh snowfal l during the first quarter of contributed to the need for overtim e in excess of budget  which accounted for of the increase payroll tax expense was up  mostly fueled by significant increase s in workers compensation and health insurance costs  accounting fo r of the increase 
the balance represents a increase i n wages 
for guidance  personnel costs are anticipated to increas e  with more controlled increases in workers compensation an d health insurance expected 
advertising costs were up  consistent with the efforts t o attract traffic and increase occupancy 
property insurance costs were up over the insuranc e expense for reflects the impact of a legal settlement related t o the portion of the policy year from january  to october  which reduced the expense by million

snow removal costs are anticipated to return to normal level s in with a decrease from levels projected 
many new property management initiatives were started in  bu t were not fully functional until the fourth quarter of  resultin g in increased property management g a 
among those initiatives are a call center  expanded marketing initiatives  and improvements i n hardware  software and staffing of the information systems department this contributed to the increase experienced in propert y management g a in the operating expense ratio the ratio of operating and maintenanc e expense compared to rental and property other income for the core properties was and for and  respectively this increase resulted from the increase in total rental an d property other income achieved through ongoing efforts to upgrade an d reposition properties for maximum potential being offset by the increase in operating and maintenance expense 
in general  th e company s operating expense ratio is higher than that experienced i n other parts of the country due to relatively high real estate taxes i n its markets and the company s practice  typical in its markets  o f including heating expenses in base rent 
general and administrative expenses g a increased in b y  or from  in to  in o f this increase   represents a one time charge for th e restricted stock granted to the leenhoutses as part of thei r retirement as co ceo s 
another  of the increase is th e direct result of the consolidation of the management companie s effective january   since the expenses of the managemen t companies are recorded directly as consolidated expenses  wherea s previously they had been a component of the company s share of th e income within the line item equity in earnings losses o f unconsolidated affiliates 
see other income above for mor e detail 
the remaining  is primarily comprised of the cost s related to the expensing of stock options for the first time beginnin g in of  other general increases of  offset by a decline of  from the cost of a legal settlement included i n not repeated in g a is expected to increase for for normal recurring expenses 
the company expects reduced managemen t activity after the disposition of the affordable general partne r interests and commercial departments will reduce g a costs  wit h increases from the remaining g a netting to the growt h expectation from to it should be noted that thes e comparisons exclude the one time retirement charge from restricte d stock granted in to the leenhoutses  which will only add to g a cost comparison savings in interest expense increased in by  as a result of th e increased borrowings in connection with acquisition of the acquisition communities  and a full year of interest expense for th e acquisition communities and additional mortgage debt an d refinanced mortgage debt incurred in connection with acquisitions i n the acquisition communities  costing in excess o f  were financed with  of assumed debt and b y issuance of interests in the operating partnership

depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to th e additional depreciation expense on the acquisition communitie s and a full year of depreciation expense for the acquisitio n communities  as well the incremental depreciation on the capita l expenditures for additions and improvements to the core properties i n and of  and  respectively  net of th e disposition communities 
prepayment penalties decreased in by  as compared t o in   was recorded in loss from earl y extinguishment of debt in connection with the sale of two of the disposed communities 
during the fourth quarter of  the compan y refinanced  in existing mortgage debt resulting in ne w borrowings in excess of  the weighted average interes t rate of the pre paid debt was  and it was replaced by loans wit h a weighted average interest rate of 
the company incurre d prepayment penalties from the early extinguishment of this debt o f in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to sell virtuall y all of the assets associated with its general partner interests in th e affordable properties to focus solely on the direct ownership an d management of market rate apartment communities 
at that time  th e company announced its intention to sell the assets  which includ e principally loans  advances and management contracts  in three phases the status of the sales is as follows phase i  consisting of the company s interest in propertie s containing  units  of which all were new york state rura l development properties  was sold on september  the sale pric e of million resulted in a gain on sale of approximately  that was recorded in the third quarter 
phase ii  consisting of the company s interest in pennsylvani a rural development and other low income housing tax credit propertie s containing  units  was sold on december  the sale pric e of million resulted in a loss on sale of approximately  that was recorded in the fourth quarter of phase iii  consisting of the company s interest in upstate ne w york  maryland  ohio and indiana properties  is under contract to a qualified buyer 
the contract price is million and the company i s working towards an expected closing in the first half of th e buyer is still engaged in due diligence  so it is possible that ther e may be some further negotiations relating to price and or th e properties to be included in the sale 
during  the company plans to pursue the sale of its genera l partner interests in one additional property two partnerships wit h  units 
it does not currently have a contract for this sale bu t anticipates a possible closing in the third quarter of th e company has guarantees to the partnerships to reimburse limite d partners for any lost tax credits totaling million and to fun d operating deficits 
the property is currently experiencing hig h vacancy 
the regulatory agreement between the entity which owns th e property and the state housing authority requires a percentage o f residents to meet certain income qualifications 
the company has ha d difficulty renting the units subject to those requirements to person s it believes are economically qualified to rent the units 
the compan y does not anticipate that occupancy levels or other aspects of th e operational outlook will improve in the foreseeable future under th e regulation restrictions 
the company funded operating deficits of million in and expects to continue to fund a similar level unti l the property is sold 
the prior operating advances are not a n indicator of future cash requirements  and  in accordance with gaap the company will record impairment charges as operating advances ar e actually incurred 
the net value of the general partnership interest s and other loans or assets associated with this property had bee n reduced to  at december  the book value at decembe r  of the company s interest in these partnerships  is a negative  the value has been reduced below zero as a functio n of losses passed through to the company as general partner all o f which  or more  have been funded in cash by the company 
since th e company does not have any agreements in process with respect to a disposition of the property  the company cannot accurately estimate a price at which the property may be disposed of  and it is likely tha t the company will have to pay a third party to purchase its interest i n and assume its liabilities with respect to future operating advance s to this property 
for the year  the company has recorded a total of million i n impairment charges  of which million pertains to an additiona l net impairment charge taken in the third quarter upon contract signin g to reduce the book value of assets in phase iii to fair market value the balance  or million  represents cash advances reflected i n either equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates million or impairment of assets held as general partner 
minority interest increased  due primarily to the effect o f the increase in income allocated to the op unitholders  which i s primarily attributable to the combination of losses associated wit h the assets associated with the limited partnerships where the compan y is a general partner that were present in and did not recu r during included in discontinued operations for the year ended december are the operating results  net of minority interest  of twelv e apartment communities disposed of in and seven apartmen t communities disposed of in the decrease in the income fro m operations component of discontinued operations principally relates t o the less than months of operations included in compared to months in the prior year

for the year ended december   income from operations incom e before gain on disposition of property and business  equity i n earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates  minority interest discontinued operations and extraordinary item increased by  when compared to the year ended december  the increase wa s primarily attributable to the following factors an increase in renta l income of  and a decrease in all other income of  these changes were offset by an increase in operating and maintenanc e expense of  an increase in general and administrativ e expense of  an increase in interest expense of  an increase in depreciation and amortization of  an d increase in prepayment penalties associated with the earl y extinguishment of debt of  and the charge for impairment o f assets held as general partner of  of the  increase in rental income   i s attributable to the acquisition communities and  i s attributable to the acquisition communities  offset in part by a  reduction of income attributable to the dispose d communities 
the balance of  relates to a increas e from the core properties due primarily to an increase of i n weighted average rental rates  offset by a decrease in averag e economic occupancy from to 
in addition to normal inflationary rent increases  the company wa s successful in achieving above normal increases at specific propertie s where rents were below the level of the average rent charged by ou r direct competition 
an additional component of the increase i n weighted average rent results from the significant upgrading an d repositioning efforts discussed below under capital improvements 
the decrease in average economic occupancy can be attributed to th e decline in general economic conditions during same stor e occupancies averaged approximately for a number of years prior t o during the second quarter of  the detroit regional marke t experienced softness that was partially related to announced lay off s in the auto industry 
a reduction in job growth leads to fewe r household formations  which creates a reduction in demand for renta l housing 
during the third and fourth quarters of  it becam e obvious that the recession was affecting all of our regions  as wel l as our competitors 
occupancy levels dipped to a low of for th e month of december from that low point in december occupancy levels increased slightly for all of  averaging

other income  which primarily reflects management and other rea l estate service fees recognized directly by the company  decrease d  due to decreased levels of management fees from propertie s directly managed by the company 
these decreased levels of managemen t fees are directly attributable to the decrease in property revenue an d occupancy at the managed properties as a result of the weak economy 
of the  increase in operating and maintenance expenses  is attributable to the acquisition communities  is attributable to the acquisition communities and a reduction of  is attributable to the dispose d communities 
the balance for the core properties  a  increase in operating expenses or  is primarily a result o f increases in real estate taxes  personnel expense  property insurance and repairs and maintenance costs  offset in part by decreases i n natural gas utilities and snow removal costs 
the insurance expens e for the year reflects the impact of a legal settlement related to th e portion of the policy year from january   to october  and reduced the expense by million 
natural gas costs for the core properties were down for th e twelve months  due to an unusually mild winter in compared t o where we expensed a combination of extraordinary increases i n natural gas prices as well as lower temperatures experienced in management believed it was in the company s best interest to tak e advantage of lower natural gas prices and to negotiate fixed pric e contracts starting in the spring of as of december   th e company had fixed price contracts covering of its natural ga s exposure for the heating season 
the company had fixed pric e contracts covering of its natural gas exposure for the heating season and further diversified its arrangement by staggerin g contract term expirations to reduce its risk at renewals 
for th e heating season  the company s negotiated average price pe r decatherm is approximately compared to an estimated cost of a twelve month fixed price contract in early of pe r decatherm 
the operating expense ratio the ratio of operating and maintenanc e expense compared to rental and property other income for the core properties was and for and  respectively this increase resulted from the increase in total rental an d property other income achieved through ongoing efforts to upgrade an d reposition properties for maximum potential being offset by the increase in operating and maintenance expense 
general and administrative expenses increased in by  o r from  in to  in the increase s principally reflect increased efforts in serving residents an d employees through new and expanded initiatives across the company s increased geographic markets  including a help desk  call center  an d an education department 
bonus expense increased  in  ne t of amounts allocated to properties and the management companies 
i n addition  the company incurred  in a legal settlement 
durin g  the company reclassified certain property related operatin g expenses from the general and administrative line to operating an d maintenance 
this reclassification was made as the company determine d that certain expenditures were more appropriately allocated to th e properties operations 
the general and administrative expenses fo r reflect this same reclassification 
the percentage of general an d administrative expenses compared to total revenue was for compared to for interest expense increased in by  as a result o f additional borrowings relating to the acquisition of the acquisition communities and a full year of interest expense for th e acquisition communities 
the acquisition communities costing in excess of  were financed with  o f assumed debt in addition to the use of upreit units 
the acquisition communities  costing in excess of  wer e financed with  of assumed debt  in addition to the use o f upreit units

depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to th e depreciation on the acquisition communities  the acquisitio n communities  the additions to the core properties  net of th e disposition communities 
the increase is net of the effect of th e change in accounting estimate made by management effective january  related to the extension of certain depreciable lives of rea l estate and related assets 
the change reduced depreciation expense fo r the year by approximately  before allocation to minorit y interest 
specifically  the company changed the useful lives of al l buildings to years regardless of the date of construction previously  the buildings were depreciated over years based o n the year of construction 
in addition  for major kitchen and bathroo m upgrades  the company determined that a year life was mor e appropriate rather than its previous life of years 
the compan y believes that the change in useful lives is more reflective of th e economic lives of the tangible assets and is also more comparable t o its peer group 
prepayment penalties increased in by  over thi s was due to prepayment penalties incurred on the company s refinancing s which took place during the fourth quarter of the company determined in the fourth quarter of that it woul d market for sale the assets associated with its interests in variou s affordable property limited partnerships 
after assessing it s alternatives in the affordable housing market  the company conclude d that it would not expand its affordable housing portfolio and that it s strategic focus should be on the direct ownership and management o f market rate properties 
the company determined that its existin g affordable property limited partnerships required a disproportionat e management effort and expense to manage  not justified by th e portfolio s overall contribution to profit 
the company s assets related to the affordable property limite d partnerships were comprised of management contracts  loans  advance s and receivables and general partnership interests 
in december an aggregate impairment charge of million was recorded by th e company and its equity affiliates and resulted from adjusting th e recorded amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value the impairment charge was comprised of the following i intangibl e assets ie management contracts were written down  to thei r estimated fair market value  ii loans  advances and othe r receivables  which had previously been based upon their estimate d collectibility but following the company s decision to sell  wer e required to be reflected at their estimated fair market valu e resulting in a writedown by an aggregate of  and iii th e general partnership equity interests were written down by  reflecting a determination that such investments have suffered a n other than temporary impairment 
impairment of assets held as general partner  equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates  in addition  prior to the decision to sell the affordable housin g portfolio in december  the results of operations were impacted b y losses incurred by certain of the affordable property limite d partnerships as a direct result of the weak economy and resultin g decrease in occupancy levels 
loans  advances and other receivables o f   by the company and  by the equit y affiliates were written down due both to i the accountin g requirements of eitf  percentage used to determine the amoun t of equity method losses  which require the general partner to recor d a greater share of the underlying investment s losses where th e investor ie the company including its equity affiliates also ha s loans outstanding and the limited partner has no capital account  an d ii the assessment of recoverability of recorded amounts based upo n the projected performance of the properties over the respectiv e repayment terms 
in addition  the company recorded an other tha n temporary impairment of  in assets held as general partner  relating to the expiration in december  of an option t o acquire one of its equity interests 
the resultant charges that woul d have been recognized regardless of the company s decision to sell th e assets is reflected in the statement of operations within the lin e items as follows impairment of assets held as general partner  equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates  the summary of the impairment and other charges related to the asset s associated with the affordable property limited partnership s referenced above reflected in the company s results of operation s is as follows sale impairment oth er charges totals assets company affiliates total company a ffiliates total company affiliates combined in thousands loans  advances and other receivables   intangible assets general partner equity recorded by the company in the line item impairment of asset s held as general partner recorded by the affiliates  and reflected by the company in th e line item equity in earnings losses of unconsolidate d affiliates equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates decrease d  from income of  in to a loss of  in a decrease of  arose from the reduction in the ne t contribution from property management and other activities of th e management companies after allocating certain overhead and interes t expense

an impairment charge o f  was recorded in order to reduce the assets to thei r estimated fair value arising from the company s decision to sell it s affordable housing portfolio see table above

ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not extend the lif e of the asset are expensed as incurred 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfa s no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long live d assets 
this standard superseded sfas no 
 accounting for th e impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to b e disposed of  but also retained its basic provision requiring i recognition of an impairment loss of the carrying amount of a long lived asset if it is not recoverable from its undiscounted cas h flows and ii measurement of an impairment loss as the differenc e between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset unless a n asset is held for sale  in which case it would be stated at the lowe r of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
however  sfa s no 
also describes a probability weighted cash flow estimatio n approach to deal with situations which alternative courses of actio n to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are unde r consideration or a range is estimated 
the determination o f undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates made b y management such as estimating future net operating income an d estimating fair value upon sale of each property owned and consider s the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequen t changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes i n anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether a n impairment exists 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations fo r impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances tha t indicates an impairment in value 
an asset is considered impaired whe n the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover th e asset s carrying value 
if such impairment is present  an impairmen t loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of th e asset over its fair value

the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  an d personal property based on management s determination of the relativ e fair values of these assets

pursuant to the definition of a component of an entity in the sfas  assuming no significant continuin g involvement  the sale of an apartment community is now considered a discontinued operation 
in addition  apartment communities classifie d as held for sale are also considered a discontinued operation

economic conditions substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term o f one year or less  which enables the company to seek increased rent s upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases
