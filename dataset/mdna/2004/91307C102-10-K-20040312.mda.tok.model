item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and statements preceded by  followed by or that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  may or similar expressions 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and united therapeutics actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
united therapeutics undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business actual revenues and net losses may differ from united therapeutics projections 
united therapeutics has made public its projections of its estimated remodulin annual revenue run rates  estimated average monthly net losses  a range of potential consolidated revenues and a projection of achieving profitability in these projections were based on numerous factors and assumptions taken into consideration at the time the estimates were made  which factors and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty 
as a result  the actual revenues and net losses may be greater or less than projected 
even small differences in the factors and assumptions can lead to significant changes in united therapeutics stock price 
united therapeutics had net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in factors that could affect the accuracy of united therapeutics expectations of revenues and profits include the following retention of current patients  addition of new patients to replace patients who discontinue remodulin therapy  remodulin side effects  including impact of infusion site pain and reaction  changes in the current pricing and dosing of remodulin  willingness of private insurance companies  medicare and medicaid to reimburse remodulin at current pricing levels  continued regulatory approval of remodulin  additional regulatory approvals in other countries for remodulin  outcome of the phase iv post marketing study of remodulin  impact of other approved and investigational competitive products  continued performance by current remodulin distributors  unforeseen expenses  actual growth in sales of telemedicine and arginine products  actual expenses incurred in future periods  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
factors that could affect the accuracy of united therapeutics estimated net loss and capital requirements include the following continued regulatory approval of remodulin  retention and growth of patients treated with remodulin  collection of accounts receivable  size  scope and outcome of the remodulin post marketing phase iv clinical study  size  scope and outcome of development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  recovery of goodwill  intangible assets and investments in affiliates  status of competitive products  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
united therapeutics has a history of losses and may never become profitable 
united therapeutics has lost money since its inception in  and its accumulated deficit was approximately million at december  united therapeutics had net losses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
united therapeutics expects to incur additional losses and may never become profitable 
united therapeutics expects its quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  depending primarily on the following factors extent and timing of sales of remodulin to distributors  level of patient demand for remodulin and other products  levels of research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
most of united therapeutics pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies 
united therapeutics might not maintain or obtain new regulatory approvals for its pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell its pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if united therapeutics sells its products  united therapeutics may never be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability it achieves 
if united therapeutics cannot maintain regulatory approvals for its products  it cannot sell those products and its revenues will suffer 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacturing  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals united therapeutics receives in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
the fda has approved remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
this approval is subject to united therapeutics agreement to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the results of that trial 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  united therapeutics cannot sell that product and its revenues will suffer 
in addition  if product approvals are withdrawn  governmental authorities could seize united therapeutics products or force united therapeutics to recall its products 
finally  united therapeutics and its officers and directors could be subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements 
if united therapeutics products fail in clinical studies  united therapeutics will not be able to obtain fda and foreign approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell its pharmaceutical products  united therapeutics must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  united therapeutics must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug and the delivery mechanism for the drug are safe and effective 
if united therapeutics cannot obtain approval from the united states food and drug administration for a product  that product cannot be sold  and united therapeutics revenues will suffer 
on may   the fda approved remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
united therapeutics agreed to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the phase iv study must be completed by december  and continued fda approval is conditioned on the completion and outcome of the phase iv study 
as of february  approximately patients had been enrolled in the patient phase iv study 
additionally  united therapeutics has initiated a pre pivotal clinical study of remodulin in critical limb ischemia 
the lead glycobiology antiviral agent  ut b  has completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies in normal volunteers and is currently enrolling a phase ii  proof of concept study 
united therapeutics is also currently conducting two phase iii pivotal studies of ovarex for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer 
united therapeutics is still completing or planning pre clinical studies for its other products 
united therapeutics ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective by physicians  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate united therapeutics expects  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not agree that united therapeutics has demonstrated that its products are safe and effective 
united therapeutics products may not be commercially successful because physicians and patients may not accept them 
even if regulatory authorities approve united therapeutics products  these products may not be commercially successful 
united therapeutics expects that most of its products  including remodulin  which is already approved by the united states food and drug administration  will be very expensive 
patient acceptance of and demand for united therapeutics products will depend largely on the following factors acceptance by physicians and patients of united therapeutics products as safe and effective therapies  reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  pricing of alternative products  convenience and ease of administration of united therapeutics products  and prevalence and severity of side effects associated with united therapeutics products  including the infusion site pain and reaction associated with use of remodulin 
discoveries or developments of new technologies by others may make united therapeutics products obsolete 
other companies may conduct research  make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of united therapeutics technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies to treat the diseases for which united therapeutics products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make united therapeutics products obsolete or noncompetitive 
one therapy approved in the united states in is tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist developed by actelion  ltd 
which competes with remodulin 
united therapeutics is aware that other endothelin antagonists are being developed  such as sitaxsentan by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc and ambrisentan by myogen  inc united therapeutics is also aware that sildenafil  being developed by pfizer  inc  is being studied for use in pulmonary hypertension 
also  iloprost  developed by schering ag and approved in in europe for pulmonary hypertension  is also being developed in the united states for pulmonary hypertension by cotherix  inc sildenafil and iloprost are currently approved for the treatment of other diseases 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for united therapeutics drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer 
united therapeutics commercial success will depend in part on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of united therapeutics pharmaceutical products 
third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new drugs 
remodulin and the associated infusion pump and supplies are very expensive 
united therapeutics believes its investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
third party payers may not approve united therapeutics new products for reimbursement or continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement 
if third party payers do not approve a united therapeutics product for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
united therapeutics relies on third parties to develop  market  distribute and sell most of its products and those third parties may not perform 
united therapeutics is currently marketing products in three of its five therapeutic platforms remodulin in the prostacyclin analog platform  the heartbar and other product lines in the arginine formulations platform  and cardiopal cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in the telemedicine platform 
united therapeutics does not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of its products and intends to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform all of those functions 
united therapeutics may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  united therapeutics will be unable to obtain marketing approvals and will be unable to sell its products 
medtronic minimed is united therapeutics exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
united therapeutics is relying on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance 
similarly  united therapeutics is relying on accredo therapeutics  inc  priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
if united therapeutics partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  united therapeutics revenues will suffer 
united therapeutics may not successfully compete with established drug companies 
united therapeutics competes with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel and third party collaborators 
united therapeutics will also compete with these companies following approval of its products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than united therapeutics 
united therapeutics is aware of existing treatments that compete with its products 
for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  approved products that compete with remodulin include the intravenous prostacyclin  flolan  marketed by glaxosmithkline plc  and tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist marketed by actelion  ltd 
with respect to the prostacyclin segment of the pulmonary arterial hypertension market  united therapeutics estimates that approximately of the patients being treated with prostacyclin in the united states are using remodulin 
products that are being developed that may also compete with remodulin include sitaxsentan being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc  ambrisentan  being developed by myogen  inc and iloprost  being developed by cotherix  inc 
sildenafil  being developed by pfizer  inc  is currently approved for the treatment of a disease other than pulmonary arterial hypertension 
iloprost is currently approved for pulmonary hypertension and other diseases in europe 
many companies are marketing and developing products containing arginine which will compete with the heartbar product line 
cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for ovarian and other cancers and hepatitis  that will compete with products in united therapeutics immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform and glycobiology antiviral agents platform 
if the licenses and assignments united therapeutics depends on are breached or terminated  united therapeutics would lose its right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses and assignments 
united therapeutics business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin  all of the products in the immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform  all of the products in the glycobiology antiviral agents platform  and the heartbar line of products 
under its product license agreements  united therapeutics retains ownership of the intellectual property subject to the terms of each license agreement  whereas assignment agreements transfer all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to united therapeutics  subject to the terms of each assignment agreements 
in addition  united therapeutics has obtained and will be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to conduct its business  including licenses for its products and an agreement for the use of the minimed microinfusion device for the administration of remodulin 
this dependence has the following risks united therapeutics may not be able to obtain future licenses and assignments at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of united therapeutics licenses or assignments are terminated  united therapeutics will lose its rights to develop and market some or all of its products  the licenses and assignments that united therapeutics holds generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event united therapeutics breaches the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  in the event that glaxosmithkline formerly glaxo wellcome or pfizer formerly pharmacia terminate their assignment agreements see patents and proprietary rights glaxo wellcome assignment and pharmacia license  united therapeutics will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
in the twelve month period ended december   sales of remodulin accounted for approximately of united therapeutics revenues 
glaxosmithkline or pfizer could seek to terminate the assignment in the event that united therapeutics failed to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to united therapeutics as required by most of united therapeutics license and assignment agreements  united therapeutics may lose its rights to develop and market some or all of its products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property itself or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
if united therapeutics patent and other intellectual property protection is inadequate  united therapeutics sales and profits could suffer or competitors could force united therapeutics products completely out of the market 
the united states patent for the method of treating pulmonary hypertension with remodulin expires in ovarex and its method of use are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents have expiration dates ranging from to united therapeutics may not be able to extend these or any other patents 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as united therapeutics products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around united therapeutics existing patents 
if this happens  united therapeutics sales would suffer and united therapeutics profits could be severely impacted 
patents may be issued to others which prevent the manufacture or sale of united therapeutics products 
united therapeutics may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing its products 
this would cause profits on sales to suffer 
united therapeutics has been granted a patent in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but pending patent applications  which have been or may be filed by united therapeutics  may not be issued 
the scope of any patent issued may not be sufficient to protect united therapeutics technology 
the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which united therapeutics intends to sell its products may not protect united therapeutics rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  united therapeutics also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
united therapeutics enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting united therapeutics proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to united therapeutics know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend united therapeutics patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for united therapeutics 
any of united therapeutics licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to united therapeutics 
the only current pending litigation to which united therapeutics is a party relates to suits initiated by united therapeutics against other parties believed to have violated united therapeutics patents related to its arginine products line 
united therapeutics has limited experience with manufacturing and depends on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of its products 
united therapeutics itself has limited experience with manufacturing 
in october  united therapeutics acquired synquest  inc  a company that manufactured treprostinil  the bulk active ingredient in remodulin  for united therapeutics 
in december  synquest was dissolved and merged into united therapeutics as its synthesis and manufacturing division 
prior to the acquisition of synquest  united therapeutics had no experience with manufacturing 
even though united therapeutics retained the employees and managers of synquest in connection with the acquisition  united therapeutics may be unsuccessful in maintaining drug manufacturing operations 
united therapeutics relies on third parties for the manufacture of all its products other than remodulin 
united therapeutics relies on baxter healthcare corporation for the formulation of remodulin 
united therapeutics relies on cardinal health to test the purity of each batch of remodulin and other products that united therapeutics is developing 
united therapeutics relies on nellson nutraceutical and garden state nutritionals to manufacture its arginine products 
united therapeutics relies exclusively on toray industries  inc to manufacture beraprost 
united therapeutics relies on other manufacturers to make its experimental drugs for use in trials 
although there are a limited number of companies that could replace each of these suppliers  management believes that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect united therapeutics research and development efforts  and future sales efforts 
united therapeutics manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of united therapeutics products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of united therapeutics products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  united therapeutics and manufacturers of united therapeutics products are subject to the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards  and although united therapeutics controls compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  united therapeutics does not have control over compliance with these regulations by its third party manufacturers  if united therapeutics has to change to another manufacturing contractor or abandon its captive manufacturing operations  fda and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of the affected product  without satisfactory long term agreements with its manufacturers  united therapeutics will not be able to develop or commercialize its products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and will have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  without substantial experience in operating a manufacturing facility  united therapeutics may not be able to successfully continue to manufacture remodulin  and united therapeutics may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for its products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of united therapeutics products  entail higher costs and result in united therapeutics being unable to effectively sell its products 
united therapeutics may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs involve product liability risks 
although united therapeutics currently has product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence  united therapeutics may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all  and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed united therapeutics liability insurance coverage  united therapeutics may go out of business 
if united therapeutics highly qualified management and technical personnel leave united therapeutics  its business may suffer 
united therapeutics is dependent on its current management  particularly its founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  its president and chief operating officer  dr 
roger jeffs  phd  its executive vice president for business development and chief financial officer  fred hadeed  and its executive vice president for strategic planning  general counsel and corporate secretary  paul mahon  all of whom are employed pursuant to multi year employment agreements 
united therapeutics does not maintain key person life insurance on these officers 
united therapeutics success will depend in part on retaining the services of its existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology is not generally available in the market  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
united therapeutics may not have  or may have to share rights to  future inventions arising from its outsourcing agreements and may lose potential profits or savings 
pursuant to united therapeutics agreements with certain of its business partners  any new inventions or intellectual property that arise from united therapeutics activities will be owned jointly by united therapeutics and these partners 
if united therapeutics does not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or united therapeutics has to share the rights with others  united therapeutics will lose the benefit of the new rights which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
if united therapeutics needs additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
united therapeutics may need to spend more money than currently expected because it may need to change its product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  preparing for commercial sales or continued sales of remodulin 
united therapeutics may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  united therapeutics may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require it to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
risks related to owning united therapeutics common stock united therapeutics stock price could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for united therapeutics common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  united therapeutics stock price could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts and united therapeutics projections  rate of product acceptance  public concern as to the safety of products developed by united therapeutics or by others  announcements by united therapeutics or others of technological innovations or new products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by existing united therapeutics stockholders  future sales of common stock by united therapeutics directors or officers  results of clinical trials  maintaining approvals to sell remodulin  timing and outcome of additional regulatory approvals  and general market conditions 
future sales of shares may depress the stock price 
if the stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of united therapeutics common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of the common stock could decrease 
such a decrease could make it difficult for united therapeutics to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
provisions of united therapeutics certificate of incorporation  by laws and rights plan could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that could be beneficial to united therapeutics and the public stockholders 
certain provisions of united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of united therapeutics securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by united therapeutics stockholders 
for example  united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may frustrate accumulations of large blocks of common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change of control or change in current management 
united therapeutics has a shareholder rights plan designed to discourage takeovers that involve abusive tactics or do not provide fair value to shareholders 
generally  the shareholder rights plan requires a hostile purchaser to pay a price per share that is substantially higher than the current quoted price of united therapeutics common stock 
provisions of united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the shareholder rights plan could discourage or make more difficult  a merger or other change of control transaction  whether or not the transaction is favored by current management or would be favorable to united therapeutics stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may make removal of current management by united therapeutics stockholders more difficult  even if such removal would generally be beneficial to the stockholders 
existing directors and executive officers of united therapeutics own a substantial block of stock and might be able to direct the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
united therapeutics directors and named executive officers beneficially own approximately percent of its outstanding common stock as of march  accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to direct the outcome of matters requiring approval by united therapeutics stockholders  including the election of its directors 
such stockholder control could delay or prevent a change of control of united therapeutics 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in united therapeutics 
united therapeutics has never declared or paid cash dividends on any of its capital stock 
united therapeutics currently intends to retain its earnings for future growth and therefore does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
executive officers of the registrant the following is a list  as of march   setting forth certain information regarding the executive officers of united therapeutics 
each executive officer holds office until the first meeting of the board of directors after the annual meeting of shareholders  and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal 
each executive officer s employment will end pursuant to the terms of his or her employment contract 
each of the employment contracts generally provide for a term of service of five years

united therapeutics commenced operations in june and  since its inception  has devoted substantially all of its resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
united therapeutics products and services united therapeutics lead product is remodulin 
on may   the united states food and drug administration fda approved remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life threatening condition characterized by elevated blood pressures between the heart and lungs 
united therapeutics agreed with the fda that it would perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the phase iv study commenced in late and the final study report must be submitted to the fda by december continued fda approval is conditioned on the completion and outcome of the phase iv study 
in  remodulin was approved for use in canada and israel 
in december  switzerland and australia announced that they would approve remodulin pending final labeling and a commitment to perform a drug interaction study in switzerland 
a marketing authorization application for the approval of remodulin in france is under review 
united therapeutics has generated pharmaceutical revenues from sales of remodulin and arginine enriched nutritional products in the united states and europe 
in addition  united therapeutics has generated non pharmaceutical revenues from telemedicine products and services in the united states primarily designed for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease 
united therapeutics has funded its operations from the proceeds of sales of its common stock and from revenues from the sales of its products and services 
remodulin marketing and sales remodulin is sold and marketed to patients in the united states by accredo therapeutics  inc  priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc and outside of the united states by international distributors 
united therapeutics sells remodulin in bulk shipments to these distributors 
the timing and extent of united therapeutics sales of remodulin are impacted by the timing and extent of these bulk orders from distributors 
bulk orders placed by distributors are determined by them  based on their estimates of the amount of drug required for current and newly starting patients  as well as an inventory equivalent to approximately thirty to sixty days demand as a contingent supply since discontinuation of therapy can be dangerous to patients 
therefore  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand in that quarter 
sales of remodulin and remodulin delivery pumps and supplies are recognized as revenue when delivered to the distributors 
as of december   approximately patients were receiving remodulin therapy worldwide  of whom approximately approximately at january  were paying for remodulin reimbursable patients 
virtually all of the patients who do not yet pay for remodulin non reimbursable patients reside in countries where remodulin has not yet been approved 
future prospects united therapeutics has incurred net losses each year since inception and has an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  united therapeutics expects to continue to incur net losses and cannot provide assurances that  in the future  it will become profitable 
future profitability will depend on many factors  including the pricing and sales of remodulin and other currently commercialized products  as well as the results and costs of research and development projects 
major research and development projects the major research and development projects of united therapeutics are the use of remodulin to treat cardiovascular diseases  immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response to treat a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies to treat infectious diseases 
cardiovascular disease projects remodulin was approved by the fda in may for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in nyha class ii iv patients to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
a condition of fda approval is that a phase iv clinical study must be completed with a final study report submitted to the fda by december the phase iv study is currently being enrolled 
remodulin was also approved in canada and israel in october for similar uses 
regulatory applications and reviews of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension are ongoing in other countries 
material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension commenced in may after fda approval was received 
remodulin is also being developed for the treatment of critical limb ischemia the advanced stage of vascular disease affecting blood vessels in the legs 
united therapeutics has completed one phase ii clinical study and an additional clinical study is underway 
united therapeutics is also developing remodulin as an intravenous therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
in  united therapeutics filed an investigational new drug application and performed animal toxicology and human bioequivalence studies to support intravenous use of remodulin 
based on positive results of these studies  in february  united therapeutics filed a supplemental new drug application snda with the fda for intravenous use of remodulin in pulmonary hypertension 
the snda is under review 
additionally  united therapeutics is in very early stages of developing other formulations of remodulin 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on remodulin development 
cancer disease projects united therapeutics monoclonal antibody immunotherapies were licensed in april from altarex medical corp 
ovarex mab is the lead product and is currently being studied in two identical phase iii clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
these studies commenced in january and are expected to require two to three years to become fully enrolled 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  on ovarex development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on ovarex development 
infectious disease projects united therapeutics infectious disease program includes drug candidates in the preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and other infectious diseases 
the first candidate for hepatitis c  ut b  completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies to assess safety in healthy volunteers in early phase ii clinical studies in patients infected by hepatitis c were initiated in july and are expected to become fully enrolled in united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  for its infectious disease programs 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for infectious disease programs 
project risks due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the products discussed above  including the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may not be perceived as safe and effective  other investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate united therapeutics expects  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or manufacture drugs  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for drug manufacture  research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in clinical trials 
if these projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals would be delayed and united therapeutics operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  united therapeutics could not commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products would be delayed or impossible to achieve 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease of approximately million is due primarily to cash used by operating activities of approximately million and approximately million used to purchase property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment at december  was approximately million  as compared to million at december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to the purchases of a building and land adjacent to united therapeutics headquarters  building improvements and equipment 
at december   total liabilities were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  and consisted primarily of trade payables  accrued expenses and notes payable 
the decrease in total liabilities of approximately million was due primarily to paying off both mortgage notes for approximately million and a reduction in the due to affiliates of approximately million  offset by increases in accrued expenses  and the addition of a million note payable resulting from the purchase of a building and land adjacent to united therapeutics headquarters 
this non interest bearing note payable was paid in january at december   total stockholders equity was approximately million  as compared to million at december  the decrease in stockholders equity of approximately million was due primarily to the net loss of approximately million incurred during the year ended december   offset by proceeds totaling approximately million received from the exercise of stock options 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to united therapeutics sales of approximately million of remodulin and approximately million of pumps and supplies to distributors in connection with remodulin  as compared to sales of approximately million of remodulin and approximately million of pumps and supplies 
in addition  sales of other products and services increased in the aggregate by approximately million to approximately million 
remodulin is sold to distributors in the united states at an agreed upon discount from the published average wholesale price awp and to international distributors at an agreed upon transfer price 
in  the published awp of remodulin was per milligram mg for the mg  mg and mg concentrations and per mg for the mg concentration 
in the first quarter of  the published awp for the mg concentration was increased to per mg to achieve uniform pricing 
also during the first quarter of  united therapeutics informed prescribers of remodulin that  based on laboratory studies completed in late  vials containing remodulin remain stable for up to days from their first use 
previously  the period of stability had been established at days 
therefore  patients are expected to use remodulin vials for longer than days and  accordingly  consume fewer vials annually 
the mg concentration price increase discussed above could increase future net sales of remodulin  while the increase in the period of stability could decrease future net sales of remodulin 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to increased expenses of approximately million for remodulin related programs and increased expenses of approximately million for the ovarex program 
see major research and development projects above for additional information

cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with the cost of service sales of approximately for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease of approximately million was attributable primarily to lower yields in and a decrease in the amount of cash available for investing as compared to the write down of investment for the year ended december  was none  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the investment write down in represents a loss due to an other than temporary decline in value of the investment in altarex medical corp 
for the six month period ended september   the quoted market price of altarex s common stock was consistently less than united therapeutics cost 
this was determined to be an other than temporary decline in the value of altarex s common stock held by united therapeutics 
as a result  the investment in altarex was written down to its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in september the fair value of this investment as determined by quoted market prices on december  and was equivalent to the amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
the loss on marketable investments for the year ended december  was none  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  in march  united therapeutics reported a  write down due to an other than temporary decline in value of one of its marketable investments 
in june  united therapeutics began reassessing its investment program in light of increasingly adverse conditions in the bond markets 
as a result  all marketable debt investments were sold in july a write down of investments totaling approximately million was necessary to adjust the value of united therapeutics marketable investments to their fair value based on quoted market prices at june  in july  united therapeutics recorded an additional realized loss of approximately million as a result of the liquidation of the investment portfolio 
equity loss in affiliate represents united therapeutics share of northern therapeutics  inc s losses 
at december   united therapeutics owned approximately of northern therapeutics 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenditures by northern therapeutics related to its autologous non viral vector gene therapy research for pulmonary hypertension and increased sales and marketing activities for remodulin in canada 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to united therapeutics sales of approximately million of remodulin and approximately million of pumps and supplies to distributors in connection with remodulin  as compared to sales of approximately  of remodulin and approximately million of pumps and supplies 
in addition  sales of other products and services increased in the aggregate by approximately million to approximately million 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease of approximately million was due primarily to a decrease from to in expenses related to patient enrollment in clinical trials of approximately million offset by an increase in of approximately million related to expenses for united therapeutics infectious disease program and the ovarex program  which was licensed to united therapeutics in april see major research and development projects above for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease of approximately million was due primarily to decreased expenses of approximately million related to the transfer of certain employees and related expenses from third party contract manufacturing activities to internal research and development functions  amortization of goodwill of approximately million for the year ended december  with no corresponding amount in due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  which eliminated goodwill amortization and decreased advertising expenses of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by increases in expenses related primarily to increased salaries and benefits of approximately million 
cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately in the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was due primarily to the commercial launch of remodulin in may in  product sales consisted largely of remodulin pumps and supplies which were sold to remodulin distributors at their acquisition cost 
cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately in the decrease in the cost of service sales as a percentage of service sales was due primarily to the growth in telemedicine service sales  which generated higher margins than other service sales 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease of approximately million was attributable primarily to lower yields in and a decrease in the amount of cash available for investing as compared to the write down of investment in represents a loss due to an other than temporary decline in value of the investment in altarex

in process research development during  united therapeutics acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cooke pharma  inc in a purchase transaction which resulted in a write off of in process research and development ipr d related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the projects under development at the valuation date involved heartbar products and were expected to address the coronary and peripheral arterial disease markets as well as the market of persons that are at risk of developing some form of heart disease 
it was anticipated that research and development related to these projects would be completed by however  united therapeutics decided to initiate studies of arginine in pulmonary hypertension prior to coronary and peripheral arterial diseases 
these studies in pulmonary hypertension commenced in and were expected to be completed in  but were terminated in april due to lack of enrollment 
additionally  due to recent discussions with regulatory authorities  united therapeutics decided that heartbar products will no longer be marketed as medical foods  which are regulated by the fda  but instead as nutritional supplements 
as a result  studies are no longer necessary to support heartbar s classification as a medical food 
in addition  there are a growing number of medical and scientific individuals and organizations investigating the cardiovascular efficacy of l arginine  the key active ingredient in heartbar 
consequently  united therapeutics studies in coronary and peripheral arterial diseases are no longer necessary for united therapeutics business plan and will not be performed by united therapeutics 
also during  united therapeutics acquired the assets of medicomp  inc in a purchase transaction that resulted in a write off of ipr d related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
at the acquisition date  medicomp was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of a number of new technological innovations for next generation products 
it was anticipated that completion of these projects would occur in while some of these have been completed  completion of others is now expected to occur in phases during this delay is not expected to have a material impact on united therapeutics 
liquidity and capital resources until june  united therapeutics financed its operations principally through private placements of common stock

in  united therapeutics issued common stock in two private placements and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
until  united therapeutics funded the majority of its operations from such net proceeds of equity 
during  united therapeutics funded the majority of its operations from revenues  mainly remodulin related  and this is expected to continue 
united therapeutics working capital at december  was approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was due primarily to the net purchase of approximately million of non current debt securities issued by united states government sponsored agencies and approximately million for the purchases of a building and land  building improvements and equipment 
current liabilities at december  were approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  united therapeutics debt at december  was approximately  as compared with million at december  and consisted of equipment leases and one mortgage note secured by the building and property owned by united therapeutics located at and spring street in silver spring  maryland

united therapeutics believes that sales of remodulin to distributors for use by the current base of approximately reimbursable patients at december  reimbursable patients at january  in the us and europe could provide an average annual revenue to united therapeutics of approximately million based on current pricing and dosing levels 
united therapeutics believes that its total revenues  together with existing capital resources comprised primarily of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be adequate to fund its operations through factors that could cause actual results of operations to differ from these expectations include the following continued regulatory approval of remodulin  expansion of existing regulatory approvals of remodulin to include intravenously delivered remodulin  additional regulatory approvals in other countries for remodulin  retention and growth of reimbursable patients treated with remodulin  impact of infusion site pain and infusion site reaction and other remodulin side effects  changes in the current remodulin pricing and dosing  changes in the length of time that remodulin vials may be used by patients  reimbursement of remodulin by public and private payers and the level of reimbursement  impact of other approved and investigational competitive products  impact of medical and scientific opinion on all united therapeutics products  size  scope and outcome of remodulin post marketing phase iv clinical studies  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  continued performance by current remodulin distributors  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  future milestone and royalty payments  risks associated with acquisitions  including the ability to integrate acquired businesses  actual expenses incurred in future periods  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  and ability of united therapeutics to maintain and grow its telemedicine and arginine revenues 
as of december   united therapeutics had available approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million in business tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes that expire at various dates through the portions of these carryforward items that were generated prior to june are subject to certain limitations 
united therapeutics does not believe that the limitations will cause the net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards to expire unused 
in october  united therapeutics agreed to purchase for approximately million a lot adjacent to its silver spring  maryland headquarters to construct laboratory facilities and united therapeutics expects that this purchase will close in united therapeutics currently expects to spend an estimated million over the next three years to construct this facility and it is currently in the planning phase 
united therapeutics is investigating various financing alternatives for the construction project 
united therapeutics expects to make milestone payments totaling  pursuant to existing license agreements during united therapeutics will make royalty payments on sales of remodulin which exceed annual net sales of million and on all arginine products during royalties on sales of all products in will range up to of sales of those products 
in december  a subsidiary of united therapeutics acquired the assets of medicomp  inc and telemedical procedures  llc together referred to as medicomp 
under terms of the acquisition agreement  united therapeutics is required to issue additional shares to the sellers since the average closing price of united therapeutics common stock over the calendar days prior to the third anniversary of the acquisition was less than per share 
it is expected that approximately  shares of united therapeutics common stock will be issued to the sellers in in satisfaction of this obligation 
contractual obligations at december   united therapeutics had contractual obligations coming due approximately as follows in thousands payment due in less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position milestone payments purchase obligations include approximately million related to the purchase in of a lot adjacent to united therapeutics headquarters 
other long term liabilities include payments that will be made to northern therapeutics to fund united therapeutics equity investment in northern therapeutics 
united therapeutics has licensed certain products from other companies under certain license agreements 
these agreements generally include milestone payments to be paid in cash by united therapeutics upon the achievement of certain product development and commercialization goals set forth in each license agreement 
total milestone payments under these license agreements have been estimated based on the estimated timing of these development and commercialization goals 
summary of critical accounting policies remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which are united therapeutics customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issues no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
had the net basis been applied  the amounts of revenues and cost of product sales reported in the consolidated financial statements would have been lower  but there would have been no impact on the net losses 
prompt payment discounts and government rebates are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
had these discounts and rebates not been reported as reductions of revenue  the amounts reported as revenues and selling expenses would have been higher  but there would have been no impact on the net losses 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be replaced  but not returned 
therefore  reserves for returns are not recorded unless product expiration or damage occurs 
intangible assets united therapeutics adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test that is performed on october of each year 
united therapeutics continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   management believed that goodwill was not impaired and therefore no impairment losses have been recorded 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
marketable investments currently  united therapeutics invests portions of its cash in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
due to united therapeutics intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  these investments are reported at their amortized cost 
united therapeutics believes that it is able to hold these investments to maturity  due to the significant level of cash and cash equivalents it has 
if united therapeutics did not have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity  it would have reported them in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair market values 
at december   the amortized cost of these debt securities was approximately million and their fair values were approximately million 
stock options united therapeutics applies the principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock options issued to its employees which generally does not require that options granted to employees be expensed 
had united therapeutics applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for its employee options  its net loss for the years ended december   and would have increased to approximately million  million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the financial accounting standards board has indicated it will likely require that companies expense employee options in the future  but it has not yet finalized the timing or methods for such a change 
investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for most of united therapeutics investments in affiliates 
the equity method of accounting generally requires united therapeutics to report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with united therapeutics consolidated financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by united therapeutics 
although united therapeutics investment in northern therapeutics exceeds  minority shareholders possess substantive participating rights that preclude northern therapeutics financial statements from being consolidated 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than ownership by united therapeutics 
the cost method of accounting does not require that united therapeutics report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with united therapeutics consolidated financial statements 
the investment in altarex medical corp 
is accounted for as an available for sale security because its stock is publicly traded 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet 
changes in their fair values are reported as other comprehensive income or loss 
declines in values that are considered other than temporary are reported as losses in the statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the investment in altarex was increased by approximately million to reflect its fair value at december   based on quoted market prices 
this increase was reported as other comprehensive income 
options issued in exchange for license in june  in connection with the license from toray industries for the sustained release formulation of beraprost an oral prostacyclin analog  united therapeutics agreed to grant options to purchase  shares of common stock to toray upon toray s adequate documentation of sustained release beraprost in humans and its transfer of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the united states 
these options will not be priced until toray has met this milestone 
if and when the milestone is met  the options would be granted at the fair market value of united therapeutics common stock at that time 
before toray can produce the clinical trial material  it will need to complete formulation  preclinical testing and early clinical studies 
due to the uncertainties in drug development  it is not yet known if toray will provide the appropriate clinical trial material 
therefore  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  these options are measured at their lowest aggregate fair value at each interim reporting date  which amount has been zero 
as a result  no expense related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements disposal activities in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas

it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  adoption of fin did not have a significant effect on united therapeutics consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of united therapeutics assets were comprised of debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  united therapeutics holds such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments would be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   united therapeutics had approximately million in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately maturing through december and callable annually 
the fair market value of this portfolio at december  was approximately million 
included in this total are two federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac notes in the amounts of million and million at december  the freddie mac notes are callable annually  mature in and bear stated interest rates of and respectively  which automatically increase by basis points each year
