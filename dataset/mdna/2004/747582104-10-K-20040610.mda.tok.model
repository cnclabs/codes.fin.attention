item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including discussions of our product development plans  business strategies and market factors influencing our results  may include forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors  both foreseen and unforeseen  including  but not limited to  our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution  consolidation  and competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
many other economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors could impact our ability to achieve our goals  and interested persons are urged to review the risks described in item business 
risk factors as set forth above  as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in our entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
historical results of operations  percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  and intangible assets  for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and goodwill impairment are among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of software licenses  services  hardware  maintenance fees  and edi services 
we currently recognize revenue pursuant to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect of certain transactions  staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab  revenue recognition 
sab summarizes the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab modifies certain guidance provided in sab inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments  which influence the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
in accordance with the governing revenue recognition guidelines  if the arrangement between vendor and purchaser does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software  revenue should be recognized when all of the following criteria are met o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  o delivery has occurred  o the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable  and o collectibility is probable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of software license revenue is based on our assessment that the above criteria have been met 
in general  the first two criteria are met with a signed contract and evidence that we have shipped our software to the customer 
we determine that our fee is fixed and determinable based on the contract terms  which specify payment terms tied to specific dates and not to any future deliverables 
probability of collection is based on a credit review of customers 
the timing or amount of revenue recognition may differ if different assessments of the above listed criteria had been made at the time transactions were recorded in revenue 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
management determines the price of individual elements sold separately using a rolling average of stand alone transactions 
vsoe calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred at vsoe and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue  net of all discounts 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgment related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue reported in its consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
goodwill impairment 
our long lived assets include goodwill of million as of march  and  respectively 
we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective april  the new statement applies to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we ceased amortizing amounts related to goodwill beginning april  the balance of goodwill is related to our nextgen division 
under sfas  we are required to perform an annual assessment of the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
we have compared the fair value of the nextgen division with the carrying amount of assets associated with the division and determined that none of the goodwill recorded as of june  the date of our last annual impairment test was impaired 
the fair value of the nextgen division was determined using a reasonable estimate of future cash flows of the division and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our business segments 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
research and development tax credits 
during the year ended march   the company filed amended federal and state tax returns for the fiscal years ended march  through  to take advantage of tax credits related to our research and development activities 
in addition  the company claimed research and development credit on its tax returns for the years ended march   and the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  accounts for approximately of the aggregate federal tax credits accumulated through march  due to the uncertainly concerning the ultimate amount to be credited 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  accounts for a portion of the aggregate state and federal tax credits claimed through the end of the period due to the uncertainly concerning the ultimate amount to be refunded 
management s election to not recognize all of the tax credits claimed represents a significant estimate which affects the effective income tax rate for the company in the years ending march  and research and development credits taken by the company involve certain assumptions and judgments regarding qualification of expenses under the relevant tax codes 
while the company has received all of federal refunds claimed  none of the credits have been audited by the internal revenue service 
credits claimed for state income tax purposes are in the process of being audited 
however  no final conclusions have been received by the company as of june  results of operations

liquidity and capital resources 
the following table presents selected financial statistics and information for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands year ended march  cash and cash equivalents at year end    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    net income    net cash provided by operating activities    days sales outstanding cash provided by operations is our principal source of cash 
cash from operations for the year ended march  consisted principally of net income before non cash related expenses of depreciation  amortization  and provision for bad debts  and increases in deferred revenue and other current liabilities  offset by an increase in gross accounts receivable 
we were able to generate operating cash flows significantly in excess of net income in the year ended march  primarily as a result of increases in deferred revenue of million and improved turnover of accounts receivable 
we were able to generate operating cash flows significantly in excess of net income in the year ended march  primarily as a result of improved turnover of accounts receivable 
provided turnover of accounts receivable  increased revenue  and profitability remain consistent with results experienced for the year ended march   we anticipate continuing to generate cash from operations primarily from net income 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million and was primarily composed of investments in capitalized software and equipment and improvements 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that additions to equipment and improvements for fiscal will be equal to or greater than historical levels 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was million  and was solely composed of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
cash received from employee stock option exercises can fluctuate from year to year 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at march   together with the cash flows from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for fiscal the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash in future periods contractual obligations total less than to years to years beyond year years non cancelable operating leases     item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we have a significant amount of cash and short term investments with maturities less than three months 
this cash portfolio exposes us to interest rate risk as short term investment rates can be volatile 
given the short term maturity structure of our investment portfolio  we believe that it is not subject to principal fluctuations and the effective interest rate of our portfolio tracks closely to various short term money market interest rate benchmarks
