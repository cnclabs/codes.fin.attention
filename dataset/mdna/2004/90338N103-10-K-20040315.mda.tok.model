overview the company s truckload segment comprises the majority of its operations  representing of consolidated revenues in fiscal revenues are primarily earned by transporting freight for customers 
additionally  revenues are derived from fuel surcharges to customers and accessorial charges such as loading and unloading fees and equipment detention fees 
the main factors that impact revenue include the revenue per mile earned from customers  number of miles driven and the percentage of miles driven for which the company is compensated 
the aforementioned factors relate primarily to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  customer demand and the level of truck capacity 
us xpress offers its customer base expertise within the specialized needs of medium to long haul solo  team expedited and regional and dedicated contract carriage 
in recent years us xpress has diversified its truckload services by focusing on growth in regional and dedicated contract services while reducing its dependency on long haul solo freight 
the approximate percentage of truckload revenue by service type in is medium to long haul solo  team expedited  regional  and dedicated contract 
xpress global systems offers its customer base expertise within the specialized needs of floorcovering logistic services and airport to airport transportation 
the approximate percentage of xpress global systems revenue by service type in was floorcovering logistic and airport to airport 
prior to the second half of  the economic environment was sluggish which resulted in lower freight demand and excess capacity within the truckload industry 
accordingly  the truckload industry generally experienced declines in asset utilization  limited ability to improve rates and lower operating margins 
however  in the second half of  the us economy and freight tonnage experienced stronger growth 
this along with the reduction in capacity enabled the industry to increase pricing during during  us xpress achieved a increase in the average rate per mile 
the trucking industry and the company continued to experience an increase in operating costs during including insurance premiums and claims  fuel prices and the cost of truck ownership including lower residual values for used trucks combined with the new epa compliant truck engines 
the industry also continues to experience an increasingly difficult driver and owner operator environment 
as a result  the company experienced an overall decline in its seated truck count compared to expectations during the company anticipates the driver and owner operator supply to remain tight within the industry during in order to address this issue  the company has initiated various programs to enhance its recruiting and retention efforts and has implemented a driver and owner operator pay increase of approximately per mile  which was fully implemented by february  effective january   the new federally mandated hours of service rules adopted by the dot became effective for all drivers 
during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented training for all drivers and operational personnel to ensure a smooth transition and continue to work very closely with customers to mitigate the impact 
effective january  accessorial charges to customers were increased with a corresponding increase in accessorial pay rates for drivers to compensate for the anticipated adverse impact on utilization 
although it is too early to determine the full impact of the new rules  the company has experienced minimal disruption to date in its operations 
the company believes that the effect of the new hours of service may adversely impact overall utilization to a degree 
however  it has anticipated that the above described increases in assessorial charges and actions taken by customers to improve efficiency will largely mitigate the effect on the company s financial results 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total revenue  excluding fuel surcharge  for each of the fiscal years indicated below 
fuel surcharge revenue is offset against fuel and fuel taxes 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this source of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel and fuel taxes vehicle rents depreciation and amortization purchased transportation operating expense and supplies insurance premiums and claims operating taxes and licenses communications and utilities general and other operating expenses early extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net income loss income loss before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income loss comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  operating revenues net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in compared to million in us xpress revenue  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in average revenue per mile to from 
the increase in average revenue per mile is due to increased rates in over the road and team expedited operations and improved freight selection 
the effect of the increase in average revenue per mile was offset by a slight decrease in average revenue miles per tractor per period 
xpress global systems revenue increased to million in compared to million in within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue increased to million  due to new and additional business with large floorcovering retailers and manufacturers combined with increased rates and an increase in airport to airport revenue of to million  due to continued penetration in the marketplace 
xpress global systems initiated its airport to airport transportation services in february salaries  wages and benefits remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue  at in compared to in salaries  wages and benefits increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in workers compensation claims combined with a growth in headcount to support the expansion of facilities and additional volume of business at xpress global systems 
fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharges  as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease is due primarily to improvements in the level of fuel surcharges billed to customers in fuel surcharge revenue was million in compared to million in the average fuel price per gallon increased approximately in compared to vehicle rents as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is primarily due to an increase of in the average number of tractors financed under operating leases to  in compared to  in the company also experienced a slight increase in the average number of trailers leased in to  compared to  in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to the increase in the ratio of leased to owned revenue equipment in compared to the decrease was offset by an increase in trailer depreciation  which can be attributed to an increase in the average number of owned trailers to  in compared to  in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is due to the increased use of rail transportation for certain long haul truckload freight in the average number of owner operators remained relatively consistent in and at and  respectively 
insurance premiums and claims as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is due to an increase in insurance rates combined with an increase in liability claims 
the company is self insured up to certain limits for cargo loss  physical damage and liability personal injury and property damage 
the current retention level per occurrence for cargo loss is   in and the retention level for liability is million per occurrence  in with the risk for the million to million level of cost per occurrence 
the company maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above amounts for which it is self insured for cargo and liability 
the company accrues for the uninsured portion of pending claims  plus any incurred but not reported claims 
the accruals are estimated based on the company s evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends 
insurance premiums and claims expense will fluctuate based on claims experience  premium rates and self insurance retention levels 
operating taxes and licenses remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue at in compared to in operating taxes and licenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is principally the result of an increase in vehicle registration and license expense 
vehicle registration and license expense fluctuates based on the trade activity of revenue equipment and the size of the owner operator and company tractor fleet 
the average number of tractors in the company s fleet including owner operators was  and  respectively in and general and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease is due to the settlement of a litigation matter for million in the fourth quarter of combined with a lower percentage growth in general and administrative expenses as compared to the percentage increase in revenues 
see footnote  commitments and contingencies  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the settlement of the litigation matter 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings  combined with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to in compared to in see footnote  long term debt  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year 
the rate is higher than the statutory rate of  primarily as a result of per diems paid to drivers which are not fully deductible for federal income tax purposes 
the company initiated the per diem driver pay plan in february see footnote  income taxes  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  operating revenues net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in compared to million in us xpress revenue  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in revenue miles and a increase in average revenue per mile to from 
revenue miles increased due to an increase in the average number of tractors to  in from  in xpress global systems revenue increased to million in compared to million in within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue increased to million  due to additional business by a large floorcovering retailer and an increase in airport to airport revenue of to million  due to continued penetration in the marketplace 
xpress global systems initiated its airport to airport transportation services in february salaries  wages and benefits  as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to the increased use of owner operators 
owner operators represented of the total fleet in compared to in fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharges  as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease can be attributed to a decline in the average fuel price per gallon of approximately in and an increase in the average number of owner operators who pay for their fuel purchases 
owner operators represented of the total fleet in compared to in vehicle rents as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decline is primarily due to lower per unit lease costs related to lower interest rates and lower lease payments due to the company having extended the trade cycle of its tractor fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization of approximately million see footnote  goodwill  of the company s consolidated financial statements and the decrease of approximately million of deferred loan costs 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is primarily due to an increase in the average number of owner operators in to  or of the total fleet  compared to  or of the total fleet in operating expenses and supplies as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is due in part to an increase in maintenance expenses due to the company having extended the trade cycle of its revenue equipment combined with an increase in tolls due to increased mileage on toll roads 
insurance premiums and claims as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is due to higher premiums for excess and reinsurance coverage related to liability claims 
prior to september   the company s retention level was  per claim 
after that date  the first retention level increased to  per claim and the company also assumed the risk for the million to million layer of claims costs per occurrence 
in addition  the company s cost for primary coverage plus the estimated cost of claims in exceeded the cost of premiums for primary coverage in beginning september   the company s retention level for liability claims increased to  operating taxes and licenses as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a decline of approximately million in trailer registration expense combined with a increase in xpress global systems revenue  which requires minimal company tractors and trailers because xpress global systems relies mainly on purchased transportation for movement of its freight 
general and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in the increase is due to a litigation charge of million  as a result of the settlement of a litigation matter 
see footnote  commitments and contingencies  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details 
early extinguishment of debt was incurred in connection with the repayment of the former revolving credit agreement 
the company incurred a charge of million related to fees and additional costs incurred with the early extinguishment of debt 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings combined with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to in compared to in see footnote  long term debt  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year 
the rate is significantly higher than the statutory rate of  primarily as a result of per diems paid to drivers  offset to a degree by certain federal and state tax credits 
see footnote  income taxes  of the company s consolidated financial statements for further details 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    cash flows cash generated from operations increased million during as compared to the increase was driven primarily by an increase in earnings of million  combined with improvements in collection of accounts receivables in the truckload segment 
cash used in investing activities decreased million during as compared to the company invested million  net of sales proceeds  in capital expenditures during compared to million during the decrease is due to the company selling significantly more revenue equipment generating cash proceeds  while a greater portion of the replacement of revenue equipment was funded through the use of operating leases 
cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of new equipment and a corresponding decrease in sales of used revenue equipment as the company extended the trade cycle of its tractor fleet 
the company expects cash capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of sales proceeds and trade ins  to be approximately to million in  primarily for the replacement of tractors and expected additions to the trailer fleet 
cash used in financing activities increased million during compared to the increase is due primarily to an increase in net repayments of long term debt of million in compared to million in the repayments of long term debt during were funded from cash flows from operations 
current maturities of long term debt at december   of million include million in balloon payments related to maturing revenue equipment installment notes 
the balloon payments are generally expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of the related revenue equipment  which is generally covered by repurchase and or trade agreements in principle between the company and the equipment manufacturer 
cash used in financing activities decreased million during compared to in december  the company entered into approximately million in equipment installment notes  the proceeds of which were used primarily to reduce borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
revolving credit agreement on march   the company entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
proceeds from this new facility were used to repay the then existing revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to million  with availability at any given time based on specified percentages of eligible receivables and revenue equipment  less reserves  under the facility s borrowing base formula 
letters of credit under the facility are limited to million 
the facility matures in march the facility allows the company to select interest rates for all or any portion of the outstanding balance  based on a base rate based on the domestic prime rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to for base rate loans and from to for libor loans  based in each case on the aggregate availability as defined 
at december   the applicable margin was for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the facility also prescribes additional fees for letter of credit transactions and a monthly commitment fee based on the difference between the total commitment and the total borrowing capacity utilized by the company from time to time 
the facility requires  among other things  maintenance by the company of prescribed minimum amounts of consolidated tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratios and leverage ratios 
it also limits the company s future capital expenditures  prohibits all acquisitions by the company of its own capital stock or the payment of dividends on such stock  and effectively prohibits future asset acquisitions or dispositions except in the ordinary course of business or other business combination transactions by the company without the lenders consent 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december  and at december   the company had million in letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under the facility  with million available to borrow 
the facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company  other than real estate and assets securing other debt 
off balance sheet arrangements the company leases certain revenue and service equipment and office and terminal facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
in making the decision to finance revenue equipment or facilities through long term debt or by entering into non cancelable lease agreements  the company considers interest rates  capital requirements and the tax advantages of leasing versus owning the equipment or facilities 
at december   the company leased approximately  tractors   trailers and office and terminal facilities under non cancelable operating leases with termination dates ranging from january to november lease payments on revenue equipment and office and terminal facilities are included in vehicle rents and general and other operating expenses  respectively  in the consolidated statement of operations 
rental expense related to revenue equipment and facilities was million in compared to million in the remaining obligation as of december  was million  with million due in the next twelve months 
certain equipment leases provide for guarantees by the company of a portion of the residual amount under certain circumstances at the end of the lease term 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted under these guarantees is approximately million at december  the residual value of a substantial portion of the leased revenue equipment is covered by repurchase or trade agreements in principle between the company and the equipment manufacturer 
cash requirements during fiscal year  the company continued to strengthen its financial position 
the company reduced outstanding debt by million to million in compared to million in at december   total capitalization was  consisting of long term debt of million and equity of million  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of compared to in in addition  the company has million available to borrow under its revolving credit facility 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under its line of credit  equipment installment loans and long term operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through the company s business will continue to require over the long term  significant capital investments in revenue equipment  which may require the company to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock of which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
based on recent operating results  anticipated future cash flows and sources of financing expected to be available  the company does not expect any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
the following table represents the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december   excluding letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the company s insurance program and are renewed on an annual basis 
payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including interest    capital lease  including interest    operating leases revenue equipment   operating leases other     purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations    represents principal and interest payments owed on revenue equipment installment notes  mortgage notes payable and capital lease obligations at december  the company had no amounts outstanding under its revolving line of credit facility as of december  other than letters of credit of million 
approximately of the company s debt is financed with variable interest rates 
in determining future contractual interest obligations for variable rate debt  the interest rate in place at december  was utilized 
the company s variable rate debt primarily bears interest at libor plus spreads ranging from to 
the table assumes long term debt is held to maturity

critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
recognition of revenue the company generally recognizes revenue and direct costs when shipments are completed 
certain revenue of xpress global systems  representing less than of consolidated revenues  is recognized upon manifest 
manifest refers to the time when the trailer of the independent carrier is loaded  sealed and ready to leave the dock 
estimated expenses are recorded simultaneous to the recognition of revenue 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as state tax credit carry forwards or state net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to the company s profitable operations on both a consolidated and separate legal entity basis 
however  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets  judgment would be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required at that time for that period 
depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets net of estimated salvage value or trade in value 
the residual value of a substantial portion of the company s equipment is covered by repurchase or trade agreements in principle between the company and the manufacturer 
periodically  the company evaluates the useful lives and salvage values of its property and equipment based upon  but not limited to  its experience with similar assets  including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets 
if the company s equipment manufacturer was unable to perform under the terms of the repurchase and or trade agreements  it could have a materially negative impact on financial results 
goodwill the excess of the consideration paid by the company over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and prior to  had been amortized on the straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
the company previously evaluated whether subsequent events and circumstances occurred that indicated the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill might warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not have been recoverable 
when factors indicated that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company used an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related businesses over the remaining life of the goodwill in measuring whether goodwill is recoverable 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized  and that amounts recorded as goodwill are to be tested for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures impairment  if any 
the company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and noted no impairment of goodwill in or claims reserves and estimates claims reserves consist of estimates of cargo loss  physical damage  liability personal injury and property damage  employee medical expenses and workers compensation claims within the company s established retention levels 
claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts the company considers adequate 
claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims  including estimates of adverse development of known claims  plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims 
accruals for cargo loss  physical damage  liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on the company s evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and historical information  primarily its own claims experience  along with assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these esitmates to change in the future 
factors that may affect future results the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to be profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest operating expenditures 
shortages of fuel or significant increases in fuel prices could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
for example  the company s average fuel price per gallon increased approximately in compared to substantially all of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel the company recognized million of fuel surcharge revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in 
however  fuel surcharges to customers do not fully recover all fuel increases due to engine idle time and out of route and empty miles not billable to the customer 
at times  fuel purchase contracts are used to mitigate the effects of increases in the prices of fuel 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future particularly due to the more restrictive driver s hours of service requirement imposed by the dot on january  the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing  proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the company is self insured for cargo loss  physical damage  liability personal injury and property damage and workers compensation claims within the company s established retention levels 
the current retention level per occurrence is  for cargo loss and workers compensation 
the retention level for liability is million per occurrence 
if the number of claims or severity of claims for which the company is self insured increases from historical levels  operating results could be adversely affected 
also  the company maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which it is self insured 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have raised premiums  which have increased the company s insurance and claims expense 
if these expenses continue to increase and the company is unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
the company is regulated by the dot 
the dot has broad powers and generally governs activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and other matters 
the epa adopted the new truck engine emissions standards which became effective for truck engine manufacturers in october  the new regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by truck engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations 
compliance with the new regulations has resulted in increased new equipment prices of approximately  to  more per engine 
additionally  the company has experienced degradations in fuel economy ranging between to 
as of december   the company had approximately  trucks in its fleet subject to the new regulations 
during  the company expects to replace approximately to trucks that will also be subject to the aforementioned emissions standards 
to the extent the company is unable to offset such increases in operating costs associated with the environmentally compliant engines with rate increases or cost savings  results of operations could be materially affected 
effective january  the new hours of service regulations became effective which resulted in the following an increase in daily drive time to hours from hours  decrease in total on duty hours from to with no extension of time for breaks  increase in cumulative off duty hours to compared to previously and restart of weekly hour count following any consecutive hours off duty 
these changes could reduce the amount of time drivers can spend driving if the company is unable to limit driver s on duty non driving activities 
the company has increased accessorial charges to customers including stop pay  loading and unloading fees and equipment detention fees to mitigate the expected impact of these new hours of service regulations 
although it is too early to determine the full impact of the new rules  the company has experienced minimal disruption to date in its operations 
the company believes that the effect of the new hours of service may adversely impact overall utilization to a degree 
however  it has anticipated that the above described increases in accessorial charges and actions taken by customers to improve efficiency will largely mitigate the effect on the company s financial results 
inflation inflation could have an adverse impact on the company s costs of operations 
a period of inflation may cause interest rates  revenue equipment prices  wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers and fuel prices to increase  which would adversely affect results of operations unless corresponding increases in freight rates could be achieved 
however  inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
seasonality in the trucking industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers increase shipments prior to and reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
additionally  shipments can be adversely impacted by winter weather conditions 
the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of the interpretation  which deferred the effective date to the first reporting period after march  the interpretation permits consolidation at historical carrying amounts as if the interpretation had always been applied  or at fair value  if determining historical amounts is impracticable 
the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effective adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
the adoption of interpretation no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no
