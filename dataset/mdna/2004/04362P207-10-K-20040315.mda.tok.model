the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview headquartered in westborough  massachusetts since july  ascential software corporation is a leading supplier of enterprise integration solutions to the global and other large organizations 
we believe that the ascential enterprise integration suite  built upon a highly scalable platform  is the industry s only complete solution that is intended to address the full data integration life cycle  and turns corporate data into intelligent information information that is reliable  relevant  and complete so organizations can make better informed business decisions and drive their strategic application initiatives 
our products for automated data profiling  data quality management and cleansing  and data extraction  transformation  and loading are built on an enterprise data integration platform of core integration offerings that are intended to provide end to end meta data management for a clear  unambiguous definition and history of the data used to drive strategic enterprise applications 
we also provide connectivity between virtually any standard data source and application as well as virtually unlimited scalability through our platform to manage the massive volumes of corporate data generated through high performance processing 
this complete offering is called the ascential enterprise integration suite and is currently  we believe  the only end to end enterprise integration platform of its type available from a single vendor 
we also offer a full range of consulting  educational and support services to assist customers through all phases of a project 
based on demonstrated methodologies  these services represent years of accumulated intellectual capital in terms of knowledge and experience  gained through many successful engagements across a range of industries and enterprise application requirements 
we support more than  customers in such industries as telecommunications  insurance  financial services  healthcare  life sciences  manufacturing  consumer goods  and retail 
we had employees as of december  we were incorporated in delaware in and  until the third quarter of  operated under the name informix corporation 
effective january   we consolidated our business units into two operating segments informix software  which operated our database software systems business  and ascential software  which operated our extract  transform and load etl and digital asset management software and solutions business 
during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of the assets of our database business  including the name informix  to ibm for billion in cash  which we refer to as the ibm transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the ibm transaction  we changed our name to ascential software corporation and changed the symbol under which our stock is traded on the nasdaq national market to ascl 
these changes became effective in july after the sale of the assets of our database business  our sole operating segment has been our ascential software business  however  we continue to incur costs associated with the termination of our database business 
barring unforeseen circumstances  remaining costs associated with the termination of our database business for the year ended december  are expected to be a relatively insignificant amount 
enterprises are faced with managing the exploding growth of data and gaining a more accurate view of the factors that impact their performance 
enterprises are also coping with the requirement to access data from an increasing number of disparate sources of data which frequently contain incomplete  inaccurate  inconsistent or duplicate information 
we believe these organizations want to be able to use the data efficiently and effectively to increase their revenue and market share  decrease operating costs and improve asset utilization 
our overall business strategy is to establish ascential software corporation as the leader in the enterprise data integration market by delivering what we believe is the industry s most comprehensive data integration product solution 
we seek to accomplish this by continuing to expand our product offerings through internal development and strategic technology and business acquisitions 
we are focused on accelerating revenue growth by leveraging our substantial customer base and the completeness of our enterprise data integration offerings  and by expanding our worldwide distribution through alliances with recognized industry leaders 
we also intend to leverage our global professional services organization to accelerate the adoption of our product offerings and provide a variety of value added services to our existing customers 
we have targeted a revenue mix of to from licenses with the balance from services 
we use a number of key metrics internally to track our progress against these objectives 
we measure our progress against achieving increased market penetration by the number of new customers signed each quarter  the number of our customers constituting fortune and global companies  and the amount of incremental revenue generated from new projects within our existing installed base 
we monitor the success of our strategic alliances by reviewing the revenue generated from these relationships and the number of license deals and revenue generated or influenced by third parties on a quarterly basis 
in order to ensure that spending is consistently monitored and resources are used appropriately  we track revenue  headcount  and spending on a weekly basis 
we regularly review all relevant margin metrics  including license margins  maintenance margins  professional service margins  total service margins and operating margins 
in addition  in order to maximize cash flow and to identify customer payment issues on a timely basis  we closely monitor cash collections and accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso 
on january   our board of directors endorsed the decision to divest our content management product line because it did not align with our strategic goals 
we engaged an investment bank to assist in the divestiture process and sought potential buyers for the product line during the six months ended june  in june  we ceased efforts to find a buyer for the product line as no interested buyers were identified and terminated the related operations  except for the completion of previously committed consulting and support contracts 
as a result  in june we recorded a charge totaling million consisting of million charged to cost of software for the impairment of software costs previously capitalized and million charged to merger  realignment and other charges for severance costs  computer equipment impairment costs and professional fees incurred in connection with efforts to sell the product line 
there is no remaining contractual customer support obligations related to this product line 
on september   we completed the acquisition of mercator 
the acquisition was made pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  dated as of august   by and among us  greek acquisition corporation  a wholly owned delaware subsidiary merger sub and mercator 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we commenced a tender offer through merger sub for all outstanding shares of common stock  par value per share  of mercator at per share in cash  without interest 
following expiration of the tender offer on september   we accepted for payment the shares of mercator common stock tendered and exercised an option granted to us by mercator for of the then outstanding common stock of mercator 
as a result of the purchase of the tendered mercator shares and the exercise of our option to purchase of the then outstanding common stock of mercator  through merger sub  we owned more than of the common stock of mercator 
substantially all remaining shares of mercator have been tendered as of december  in addition  all outstanding options to purchase shares of mercator common stock granted under the tsi international software ltd 
stock option plan  the novera software inc stock option plan and the mercator software  inc equity incentive plan were converted into options to purchase shares of our common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
the aggregate cash purchase price for all of the common stock of mercator was approximately million  net of cash acquired from mercator see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of mercator from september  to december  are included in our consolidated results of operations 
during the three months ended december   we commenced efforts to sell our key master data entry software line  which was formerly owned by mercator  and is not part of our core enterprise data integration offering 
on january   we entered into a software purchase agreement with phoenix software international  inc phoenix pursuant to which we sold the rights to our key master data entry product line 
products and services our products are designed to operate as part of the ascential enterprise integration suite  or as stand alone integration components 
our product functionality includes automated data profiling to analyze and manage source data content and structure  data quality and cleansing to identify  correct and reconcile inaccurate or redundant data  and data extraction  transformation and loading to obtain data from a source  format it as required  and deliver it to a specified target 
our products are supported by a comprehensive platform of integration services that delivers end to end meta data management  connectivity between virtually any standard data source and application  and virtually unlimited scalability and performance 
this combination of integration products built on a platform of integration services forms the ascential enterprise integration suite 
the ascential enterprise integration suite offers a comprehensive  modular solution that can expand with business needs or as customer budgets dictate 
our customers can deploy the complete ascential enterprise integration suite to address the entire enterprise data integration life cycle  or use individual integration products as needed in support of more limited scope implementation requirements 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues  results from operations  and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the areas that we believe to be our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and merger  realignments and other charges 
these areas are described below 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from two primary sources software license revenues and services revenues  which include maintenance  consulting and education revenues 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants sop  in the application of this standard we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
generally  we sell software using primarily two types of licenses perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a fixed number of users with no right to return the licensed software  and enterprise licenses software licensed on either a perpetual or term basis to a customer as opposed to a fixed number of users  with no right to return the licensed software 
generally  our software license arrangements do not include significant modification or customization of the underlying software  and as a result  we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
substantially all of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 
we define each of the four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or a purchase order with negotiated governing terms or volume purchase agreement  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
sales to resellers are generally evidenced by purchase orders submitted to us under a master agreement governing the terms of the relationship 
certain reseller arrangements are structured as royalty agreements in which royalties as a percent of either list price or net sales price are due to us upon product shipment to the end user customer 
evidence of arrangement in these circumstances consists of request for shipment  or notification of shipment  for resellers who ship duplicates directly either to end user customers from a master copy 
delivery has occurred software is generally delivered either through electronic delivery or physically on a compact disk using standard free on board shipping point terms in which title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon shipment 
for some existing customers  delivery may occur when the customer has been provided access codes if the newly purchased software is already contained on a previously delivered compact disk 
it is uncommon for us to offer a specified upgrade to an existing product  however  in such instances  revenue is deferred until the future obligation is delivered 
our software solutions continue to be distributed primarily through our direct sales force  however  our indirect distribution channel continues to broaden through alliances with resellers 
revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sell through basis  that is  when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an end user customer 
evidence of sell through may take a variety of forms  including a copy of the purchase order or contract identifying an end user customer  and a royalty or sell through report from the reseller  or other documented  objective evidence of product shipment 
we do not offer our resellers contractual rights of return  stock balancing  or price protection 
the customer s payment is deemed fixed or determinable we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
while our standard payment terms are net days subject to requirements of foreign jurisdictions  we have a practice of providing extended payment terms of less than one year on high dollar sales to credit worthy customers 
we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that provide for at least of the balance due within months and of the balance due within months from the contract date 
collection is probable likelihood of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
both new and existing customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
our license arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist  for example  in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed agreements that we are not able to renegotiate  we then apply judgment in assessing the significance of the provision 
if we determine that the likelihood of non acceptance in these arrangements is remote  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  assuming that the requirements described above have been satisfied 
many of our software arrangements include consulting services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts that generally include implementation  network configuration  and optimization services 
these services are often provided completely or partially by independent  third party system integrators experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel 
revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance 
we account for software license revenues included in multiple element arrangements using the residual method prescribed in sop under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements ie  maintenance  consulting  and education services based on vendor specified objective evidence vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  software license 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist  revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those services occurs or fair value can be established 
we determine vsoe of fair value for services revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately  and maintenance services  may also be measured by substantive renewal rates 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by market conditions  product type  purchase volume  maintenance term  and geography 
significant incremental discounts offered in multiple element arrangements that would be characterized as separate elements are infrequent and are allocated to software license revenues under the residual method 
maintenance services generally include rights to upgrades when and if available telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
consulting revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed on a time and materials basis 
consulting revenues for fixed priced contracts are recognized using percentage of completion accounting described below 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of services revenue 
education services include hands on  web based and classroom training and self evaluation 
education revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing education services are included in education revenue with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of education revenue 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses  when known based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collection certainty of customer accounts and other receivables  for which we generally do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic and accounts receivable aging trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances might be required  resulting in future operating expenses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is not significant 
software development costs we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development costs until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
we achieve technological feasibility for each product upon completion of a detailed program in which we have established that the necessary skills  hardware and software technology are available to us to produce the product  the completeness of the detailed program design has been confirmed by documentation and tracing the design to product specifications  and the detailed program design has been reviewed for high risk development issues for example  novel  unique  unproven function and features or technological innovations  and any uncertainties related to identified high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
significant judgment is required in determining technological feasibility and the estimated life that related capitalized costs will be amortized 
in addition  capitalized software costs must be carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
therefore  if the estimated future operating profits related to a product do not exceed the related capitalized software development costs  then an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the value of the capitalized software development costs to its net realizable value 
if there are significant changes to the development process or product strategy  it could materially impact the net realizable value of the previously capitalized costs and the amount of future costs that are capitalized 
business combinations the purchase price of businesses acquired  accounted for as purchase business combinations  is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
significant management judgment and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangibles 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangibles is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   and as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
we have two reporting units which are currently the same as our operating segments  ascential software and informix software as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all goodwill is attributable to our ascential software reporting unit 
to conduct these tests of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of december st of each fiscal year 
in fiscal  our annual impairment review concluded that no impairment charge was required 
there can be no assurance that at the time subsequent impairment reviews are completed an impairment charge will not be recorded in light of the factors described above 
if a charge were deemed necessary in the future  it would directly affect net income loss for the period in which the charge was taken 
for long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived assets  we assess the recoverability of the asset on projected undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset  determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset 
determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets includes significant judgment by management 
different judgments could yield different results 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense 
in fiscal  we have partially reserved our deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards generated in prior periods 
the establishment of a deferred tax valuation requires considerable judgment 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
we maintain reserves related to prior years income taxes for uncertainties in the tax treatment of certain items in various tax jurisdictions  particularly as they relate to disposed operations 
these tax reserves are maintained until such time as we resolve the tax treatment of these items via the completion of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of tax  or additional factual development or discovery which results in a change in estimate 
management judgment is required to assess the probability and amount of the tax reserves  and our estimates are continually re evaluated and updated each reporting period to reflect current information 
if our estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may need to make changes in these estimates that would materially affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
merger  realignment and other charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes in our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other environmental factors 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates amounts will be reviewed and potentially revised quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the creditworthiness of subtenants  and may result in revisions to established facility reserves 
if our sublease assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to make changes in these estimates that would affect our results of operations and potentially our financial condition

during  we made significant progress toward our long term goals for operating performance 
we achieved growth on total revenue  with growth in license revenue 
this was achieved by a substantial improvement in the productivity of our sales force  by leveraging new product deployment into our existing customer base  and includes revenue attributable to products obtained through the mercator acquisition totaling million in the last month of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter of even without the benefit of the revenue achieved from products and services associated with the mercator acquisition  our revenue growth was

this revenue growth  combined with the results of cost control efforts  enabled us to improve all margin metrics that we measure 
our gross margin for improved to million or of total revenue compared to million or of revenue during  an increase of percentage points 
this increase was driven by the license revenue growth that we experienced and a improvement in our services margins 
the services margin improvement was a result of an expanded maintenance base as well as more profitable and extensive consulting engagements 
our operating margin improved from in to in of this improvement  approximately half resulted from a reduction of costs related to termination of businesses and product lines and merger or realignment activities  with the remainder resulting from the leverage afforded by the revenue growth and adjusted cost structure

sell total license revenue license revenue for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this million increase was a result of an improvement in sales force license productivity on a worldwide basis  measured as total license revenue divided by the average number of quota carrying sales reps during the year 
we experienced this productivity improvement principally in our north america and europe sales regions and it was driven by increases in both price and volume of products sold  including a million contribution to license revenue from mercator products 
more than of the license revenue in and was generated by transactions greater than  the number of such transactions increased from to caused principally by an increase in transactions conducted directly with existing customers 
the average selling price of licensed products in license transactions greater than  increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december  we experienced an increase in average selling price principally in transactions conducted directly with existing customers due to an expanded and higher priced product offering following the addition of products and technology acquired from torrent systems inc torrent  vality technology incorporated vality  metagenix  inc and mercator software  inc 
that were integrated into the ascential enterprise integration suite  the release of enhancements to existing products and new products during the second half of and the third quarter of  and three significant license transactions during that collectively generated million in license revenue 
license revenue under our agreement with ibm increased million or as compared to during and  we terminated various product lines in an effort to focus product sales on our enterprise integration product offerings that had been expanded during that time 
as a result  license revenue for ascential software for the year ended december  decreased or million to million from million for the same period in the decrease consists of an million decrease in revenue from our content management product line  which we stopped selling during the second quarter of  a million decrease in revenue from our i

sell product  which was discontinued in the first quarter of these declines were partially offset by a or million increase in revenue from enterprise data integration products 
this increase was caused by the addition of products and technology acquired from torrent  vality and metagenix that were integrated into our enterprise data integration product offering and the release of new products during our expanded product offering contributed to increased sales volume and an increase to the list prices of our products  which in turn enabled us to achieve higher average selling prices in additionally  one license transaction generated million in license revenue 
the overall increase in revenue from enterprise data integration products was positively impacted during by leveraging the reseller arrangement that we entered into with ibm during the second half of whereby ibm resells our products 
license revenue under this arrangement increased million during total resale revenue from ibm represented of our total revenue in termination of our relationship with ibm  if it were to occur  could have a negative impact on our financial results if the revenue is not replaced

the increase in maintenance revenue is net of an million decline in maintenance revenue from the content management product line that was terminated in the second quarter of revenue derived from consulting and education increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period of the increase in consulting and education revenue is attributable to an increase in the volume of and the average size of consulting engagements  principally in north america and europe  associated with the increased penetration of those geographic areas and the expansion of our product offering as discussed above 
with the addition of products to our product set over the past two years  consulting engagements generally have become more extensive and have expanded across enterprises where they were previously focused on departments within enterprises 
the overall increase in consulting and education revenue corresponds to the increase in license revenue over the same period and was impacted by two large consulting engagements in europe during that together contributed million to the growth 
the overall increase is net of a million decline in consulting and education revenue from content management products 
we expect that future growth of consulting  maintenance and education revenue  barring unforeseen circumstances  will be largely dependent on the growth of license revenue 
as discussed above  during and we terminated various product lines in an effort to focus our efforts on our core enterprise integration product offerings that had been expanded during that time 
as such  the services revenue associated with corresponding license revenue declined  resulting in a or million decrease during the year ended december  to million from million for the same period in this is primarily due to a million decline in services revenue associated with our content management products  a million decline in services revenues from our analytic i

these declines were partially offset by an increase in total enterprise data integration services revenue 
total maintenance revenue increased by  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due to a or million increase in maintenance revenue from enterprise data integration products associated with our growing installed base of customers  including customers acquired from vality and torrent 
the increase was partially offset by decreased maintenance revenue related to the termination of products and the associated decline in their maintenance revenue streams  including a million decrease in maintenance revenue principally associated with our i

decide product  a million decrease associated with the discontinuation of our i 
sell products  and an or million decrease in consulting revenue related to enterprise data integration product offerings 
this decrease of million consists of a million decrease due principally to three large consulting projects that were in process during but which were completed during and not completely replaced by new projects  a decline in product license revenue in the first quarter of  which had an impact on follow on services purchased  and an increase in indirect sales of products whereby the associated services are delivered by third parties 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in consulting and education revenue associated with new licenses

costs and expenses ascential software and informix software the following table compares the costs and expenses for the businesses of ascential software and informix software for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  ascential software cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses informix software cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses ascential software corporation combined total of ascential software and informix software cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses ascential software costs and expenses years ended december   and cost of licenses 
cost of licenses consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs or acquired technology and previously capitalized software that was written off  third party royalties  and distribution and manufacturing personnel costs 
during the year ended december   cost of licenses decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease was the result of two primary factors 
first  amortization costs decreased by million driven by a decline of million in asset impairment costs related principally to the write off of capitalized software associated with our content management and axielle products 
axielle had been our portal product offering 
both of these product lines were terminated in the second quarter of this decline was offset by a million increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs and a million increase in amortization principally related to developed technology acquired through the vality and mercator acquisitions 
we acquired million of completed technology in connection with the mercator acquisition in the third quarter of that is being amortized over years and  accordingly  we began to recognize amortization expense in september  the vality acquisition did not occur until the second quarter of as a result  we began to recognize amortization expense related to the vality developed technology in the second quarter of future amortization costs may increase if we acquire new technology through strategic business combinations or technology purchases 
second  third party royalties increased million due to an additional million during in amortization of prepaid license royalties acquired in connection with the june  settlement of a dispute with former shareholders of integrasoft  inc a company that we acquired in and an increase of million in miscellaneous third party royalties associated with increased license transactions 
during the year ended december   cost of licenses increased by  or million  to million from million during the same period of the most significant item contributing to the increase was million of impairment charges related to the termination of product lines  million associated with the content management product line and million associated with our former axielle product 
software amortization increased by million as a result of a million increase in amortization of purchased technology  principally related to the acquisitions of torrent and vality  and million of amortization related to the acquisition of our ascential profilestage technology from metagenix 
software amortization related to internally capitalized software declined by million primarily as a result of the impairment of the content management and axielle technology 
we acquired million of completed technology through the torrent acquisition on november  and million of completed technology through the vality acquisition on april  both are being amortized over three years on a straight line basis 
we paid approximately million through december  to acquire and further develop ascential profilestage and are amortizing payments over three years on a straight line basis 
royalty costs declined by million during primarily due to the decline in license revenue from our content management and i 
sell product offerings that were licensed with much higher third party royalty costs than enterprise data integration products 
once these product lines were terminated  we were no longer required to pay the associated royalties 
as part of the settlement of a dispute with former shareholders of integrasoft  inc  which we acquired in  we recorded million of prepaid royalties that we amortized over eighteen months on a straight line basis and were fully amortized by december  the costs of distribution personnel and media increased by million during this function was shared with the informix database business during most of and the operating costs on a stand alone basis exceed the portion of shared costs previously allocated to the ascential software operation 
cost of services 
cost of services consists of maintenance  consulting and education personnel expenses and third party subcontracting costs 
the following table depicts the trend in service margins for the three years ended december    and  respectively years ended december  ascential software total service margin maintenance margin consulting and education margin cost of services for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million from million in the same period of this net increase is a result of the impact of a combination of factors 
we incurred million in additional costs of consulting and education  principally headcount  third party subcontracting  commissions and travel associated with generating an additional million in data integration consulting and service revenue 
we also incurred million in additional maintenance costs  principally headcount related  associated with generating million in additional data integration maintenance revenue as compared to additionally  there was a total of million of transition costs that will not recur associated with the integration of mercator service operations into the operations of ascential 
these increases were offset by a million decline in service costs related to the content management product line 
although there was only million in associated content management service revenue in  the completion of certain engagements required the use of third party subcontractors 
additionally  we attempted to maintain our base of technical employees despite the decline in revenue opportunities associated with content management products intact during the process of seeking a buyer for that product line during the first half of the total services margin increased to for the year ended december  from during due to substantial improvements in both maintenance and consulting and education margins during the year 
the improvement in our maintenance margin was a result of the increase in total maintenance revenue by million on a year over year basis with an increase to headcount only for those mercator employees who became ascential employees in connection with the acquisition of mercator during the third quarter of we have accomplished this by leveraging our existing technical support personnel  as well as our on line support website  in providing customer support 
the improvement in consulting and education margins is a result of the termination of the loss generating content management business  as described above  headcount reductions in late  the benefit of which was realized in  as well as an increase in the number and average length of enterprise data integration consulting engagements that enabled improved utilization of our consultants 
cost of services for the year ended december  decreased or million to million from million for the same period in the decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in services headcount between december  and december   even after taking into account approximately services employees added through the acquisition of vality 
the cost savings related to the headcount reductions were offset somewhat by increased subcontracting costs as we moved toward a more variable cost model for delivering our consulting services 
the total services margin improved to in the year ended december  from in the same period in this improvement was caused  in part  by an increase in the proportion of the higher margin maintenance revenue to total services revenue for the same periods 
for the year ended december   the maintenance business represented of total service revenue and generated a margin of while  for the year ended december   the maintenance business represented of total services revenue and generated a margin of 
the improvement in the consulting and education margins to in from in is a result of cost control efforts and improved utilization of consultants 
this margin improvement was partially offset by the wind down of the content management business during which time the completion of consulting engagements for that business required additional subcontracting of third party consultants 
cost of services for the year ended december  includes million of costs associated with the content management business 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing  communications programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million from million for this increase is principally the result of a million  or  increase in commissions and bonuses associated with a increase in total revenue over the prior year  with the remaining increase attributable mainly to increased marketing program spending associated with new products and increased marketing activities 
increased costs in the third and fourth quarters of related to transitional activities of million and net headcount additions to selling and marketing functions of approximately associated with the mercator acquisition were generally offset by headcount reductions in these functions that occurred in the second half of  the benefit of which was realized in total selling and marketing headcount was at december   including quota carrying representatives 
this compares to quota carrying representatives as of december  we currently plan to increase our sales headcount during depending on the revenue  productivity and growth levels that we may experience  barring unforeseen circumstances 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing headcount between december  and december  as well as a reduction in marketing program expenditures 
approximately sales and marketing employees were added through the acquisition of vality  however these increases were offset by reductions to the total sales and marketing headcount  which was at december   including quota carrying sales representatives 
although overall sales and marketing headcount was reduced during  our focus throughout the year was also to shift sales headcount to regions with more revenue growth potential and to take measures to improve the productivity of our sales force 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project consulting and related overhead costs for development of our products 
during  our research and development efforts were focused primarily on major enhancements to the ascential enterprise integration suite 
in september   we released ascential enterprise integration suite incorporating these major enhancements 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased  or million  to million from million for this increase is a result of a increase in headcount from december  to december   principally affecting the fourth quarter  related to mercator research and development personnel who became ascential employees following the acquisition  a million increase in consultant and subcontractors costs during  and million in costs that will not recur associated with mercator transition activities 
this total increase is net of a reduction of million in costs associated with the content management product line from to during the first quarter of  we were seeking a buyer for this technology and  until the product line was terminated at the end of the second quarter of  we continued to incur costs in order to maintain the technical personnel base associated with the product line 
without these costs in  costs associated with enterprise data integration research and development activities increased during capitalization of software development costs during related principally to the development of the release of our ascential enterprise integration suite and increased by approximately million during as compared to as a result of an increase in overall spending and the status of capitalized projects 
we expect  barring unforeseen circumstances  research and development headcount  which was at december   to increase slightly during development efforts during were focused on integrating the technology acquired from vality  torrent and metagenix and creating major enhancements to our enterprise data integration product suite 
research and development expense for the year ended december  decreased  or million  to million from million for the same period in this decline is due primarily to a reduction of million in amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of this reduction was a result of the implementation of sfas  effective january   which eliminated the amortization of intangibles with indefinite lives 
additionally  total engineering headcount was reduced by between december  and december  this headcount reduction relates to employees associated with the content management product line and is net of the addition of approximately engineering employees in connection with the acquisition of vality 
these cost reductions were offset by increased net expense resulting from a reduction in the amount of internal software capitalized 
we capitalized million less in as compared to as a result of reduced headcount costs and the timing and status of engineering projects during as compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million from million for bad debt expense decreased million as a result of improvement in the aging of accounts receivable balances and the resolution of reserved balances associated with the content management business 
days sales outstanding was days at december  compared to days at december  costs associated with temporary and subcontracted help as well as professional fees for audit and tax services declined a total of million after the completion of the integration of the former informix west coast and our east coast finance departments following the ibm transaction 
personnel and related overhead costs declined million as a result of the closure of facilities and cost control efforts 
these declines were offset by a million increase in legal costs relating to defense and settlement of claims and other matters and a million increase in costs that will not recur associated with transitional activities for mercator 
during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expenses experienced during the year is attributable to several factors 
the entire year of included personnel and information technology infrastructure costs for a fully staffed and independent general and administrative function 
in contrast  general and administrative expenses for the first three quarters of were ratably distributed over the ascential software business and the informix software business 
in order to function independently  we were required to appropriately staff these functions and our corporate expenditures for audit and tax advisory fees  insurance costs  and similar services also increased resulting in an overall increase of administrative costs of million compared to in addition  the year ended december  includes an increase of million in certain  primarily litigation and dispute related  legal costs compared to the same period of the previous year 
the increased costs in the year ended december  are offset by a decline of million in bad debt expense 
through the segmentation of accounts receivable balances in connection with the sale of assets related to our database business  several ascential software accounts were identified that were deemed to be uncollectible 
this segmentation process  combined with the termination of the i 
sell product  resulted in an unusually high bad debt expense during of million 
while bad debt expense declined significantly during  million of the amount recorded in related to accounts associated with licensing of content management products which became uncollectible as a result of the change in strategy for that product line during as a result of the reserves recorded for the content management product receivable and improvement in the collectibility of receivable balances due to increased transactions with fortune companies  we reported dso  or days sales outstanding  of days at december  compared to days at december  dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable net  as of the balance sheet date  by the quotient determined by dividing the current quarter s net revenue by ninety days 
merger  realignment and other costs 
these costs are discussed separately in section iv 
merger  realignment and other charges ascential software corporation below 
write off of acquired in process research and development ascential software 
the value of in process research and development iprd is determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
in connection with the mercator acquisition in september  we recorded a charge of million  or approximately of the million in total purchase price  for iprd 
the value allocated to the mercator project identified as iprd was charged to operations during the three months ended september  at the acquisition date  mercator s sole iprd project was release of the mercator inside integrator software product 
at the date of the acquisition  iprd was approximately complete  based upon costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the project 
mercator had incurred approximately million in expenses related to this project at the date of the acquisition 
the key features of release include multiple event server functionality  enhanced support for standard xml data and support for the latest bit hardware  operating systems and application software 
as of the mercator acquisition date  release of the mercator inside integrator software product had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of an in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
we base iprd on the cost of equity plus basis points 
given the riskier nature of the cash flows related to the iprd for mercator  we believe that a higher discount is warranted 
the resulting cash flows attributable to the iprd were discounted at a discount rate of 
the resulting net cash flows to which this discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology 
it is anticipated that  barring unforeseen circumstances  substantially all of the features of release of the mercator inside integrator software project are expected to be completed in the second quarter of some of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the completion of the project include  but are not limited to  the difficulty of predicting the duration of product development and the risks that changes in the product requirements will result in unexpected redesign activity 
in connection with the vality acquisition in april  we recorded a charge of million  or approximately of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for iprd 
the value allocated to the projects identified as iprd was charged to operations during the three months ended june  at the acquisition date  vality s in process projects were wave  irt and auto 
the wave product provides capabilities to allow end users with extensive multinational files to easily invoke a single process to standardize  enhance and verify input address information using relevant postal reference files 
the in process wave project sought to produce a technical design that would allow the existing waves product to function on a new operating platform 
the wave project was initiated in june and completed by the end of july at the acquisition date  iprd associated with the wave project was approximately complete  based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the product 
we incurred million of costs to complete this project  which was consistent with management s expectation as of the acquisition date 
the irt project sought to produce a new application protocol interface that would provide a new paradigm for the development and deployment of real time data quality applications on a new operating platform 
the project was initiated in october and was completed in july at the acquisition date  iprd associated with the irt project was approximately complete based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the project 
we incurred another million of costs to complete this project  which was consistent with management s expectation as of the acquisition date 
the auto project is intended to provide a learning engine that can generate new pattern action language rule sets with the use of advanced mathematical techniques 
the auto project was initiated in april and at the date of the acquisition management estimated that the completion of the project would be accomplished by the end of november at the acquisition date  management had estimated that iprd was approximately complete  based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the product 
at the date of the acquisition  we expected to invest another million of development costs in this product 
due to turnover of research and development personnel  management now estimates that  barring unforeseen circumstances  this project will be completed by the end of the third quarter of and we currently expect to invest approximately another million into development in order to do so 
as of the vality acquisition date  wave  irt or auto technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of an in process product is established when a company has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
the discount rate used for the determination of vality iprd ranged from to  consistent with the characteristics of each iprd project  a premium over the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the resulting net cash flows to which the discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology 
in connection with the torrent acquisition in november  we recorded a charge of million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for iprd 
the value allocated to the project identified as iprd was charged to operations in the fourth quarter of at the acquisition date  torrent s principal in process project was to add a new graphical user interface as well as additional features and functionality to an existing product 
this technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
at the date of the acquisition  management estimated that completion of the project would be accomplished by the end of february the initial development effort commenced in january at the acquisition date  iprd was approximately complete  based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the product 
at the date of the acquisition  we expected to invest another million of development costs in this product 
during  we decided not to complete this project but instead to integrate torrent s products into the ascential enterprise integration suite 
the discount rate used for the determination of torrent iprd was  a premium over the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the resulting net cash flows to which the discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology 
costs and expenses informix software years ended december  and and six months ended december  the following table presents the costs and expenses of informix software for the years ended december  and and the six months ended december  in millions year ended december  year ended december  six months ended december  cost of software cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative merger  realignment and other charges total costs and expenses in the year ended december   general and administrative costs for informix software totaled million 
these costs consist principally of million in legal expenses associated with the litigation and settlement of disputes associated with the historical database operations and million of administrative and liquidation costs associated with the closure of subsidiaries and transitioning personnel 
these costs were offset by million in reductions to expense related to the reversal of accruals for estimated database liabilities that were resolved for amounts less than had been originally estimated 
during  we expect that costs related to informix software will be million or less per quarter  barring unforeseen circumstances 
the costs and expenses for informix software for the year ended december   excluding merger  realignment and other charges  totaled million 
this amount included million related to closing the operations of the general and administrative groups formerly located in our prior corporate headquarters that was relocated to westborough  massachusetts  including retention bonuses paid to terminated employees  million in dispute resolution and legal defense costs for the settlement of disputes associated with the historical database operations  million for information technology costs resulting from the separation of the businesses  and million for the write off of foreign value added taxes that are unrecoverable as a result of the sale of the database business assets 
these transitional costs were offset by the reversal of million that was not required to be paid due to a favorable resolution of a litigation matter in germany during the year 
the costs and expenses for informix software for the six months ended december  consist primarily of expenses resulting from the database operations in the nine remaining countries in which our database operations were not terminated until august  as part of the ibm transaction until august   and transitional database costs 
the million of general and administrative expenses for the six months ended december  consisted primarily of a million charge recorded in respect of the legal actions filed with respect to the unidata operations in asia see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of salary and related costs for transitional employees and executives of the database business that did not join ibm subsequent to the ibm transaction

iv 
merger  realignment and other charges ascential software corporation merger  realignment and other charges year ended december  during  we recorded million of merger  realignment and other charges of which million is expected to be paid in cash 
the following table summarizes the components of these charges  distinguishing charges that relate to the ongoing ascential software business and those that relate to the informix software business sold in the ibm transaction in millions year ended december  ascential software informix software total severance and employment related costs fourth quarter realignment third quarter realignment total severance and employment related costs facilities and equipment costs ibm transaction total merger  realignment and other charges ascential software severance and employment related costs 
during the third and fourth quarters of we recorded a total of million of severance and related costs to terminate employees in connection with the consolidation and integration of our operations following the mercator acquisition 
expected savings 
we anticipate that  barring unforeseen circumstances  the realignment activities undertaken during will reduce operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis when completed when compared to this expected savings is principally selling and marketing expenses 
we estimate that all of the savings will be cash savings 
we may record future merger  realignment and other charges as we continue to assess the appropriate size of our infrastructure 
informix software facilities and equipment costs 
realignment charges totaling million in the year ended december  consist entirely of adjustments to facility reserves to reflect updated estimates of remaining obligations on vacated facilities based on current market conditions  net of anticipated sublease income 
expected savings 
we do not currently expect that the realignment activities undertaken during will have a significant impact on future operating expenses as these activities primarily relate to the adjustment of reserves that were recorded in and earlier 
merger  realignment and other charges year ended december  during  we recorded million of merger  realignment and other charges  of which million were expected to be paid in cash

additionally  million was incurred as part of our second quarter realignment plan for professional fees to terminate our content management product line 
informix software severance and employment related costs 
during  we approved plans to continue to eliminate costs from our informix software business that resulted in the termination of employees and a charge of million 
facilities and equipment costs 
during  we approved realignment plans that included revised estimates to exit facilities related to the ibm transaction and write off of abandoned fixed assets that resulted in a charge of million 
we recorded a charge of million to revise estimates to exit facilities related to the ibm transaction consisting of million for the revision of reserve assumptions to reflect current market conditions and million to assume additional leases  partially offset by million related to the release from lease obligations of certain facilities 
we recorded a charge of million related to our third quarter realignment plan to write off abandoned fixed assets primarily at vacated facilities 
we recorded a charge of million related to our second quarter realignment primarily for costs to manage facilities being exited 
we also recorded a charge of million related to our first quarter realignment plan for facility lease management and other lease obligation costs and million related to our realignment plan for revised sublease assumptions due to a change in market conditions 
during we reversed million of costs related to the ibm transaction  primarily for the refund of a facility deposit that had been previously reserved 
other 
during  we approved plans to eliminate costs from our informix software business that resulted in million of charges for other exit costs and reversed million related primarily to the ardent acquisition since reserves were no longer required as obligations were settled for amounts less than the recorded estimates 
merger  realignment and other charges year ended december  during  we recorded million of merger  realignment and other charges of which million were expected to be paid in cash 
the following table summarizes the components of these charges and distinguishing charges that relate to the ongoing ascential software business and those that relate to the assets of our database business sold in the ibm transaction in millions year ended december  ascential software informix software total severance and employment related costs third quarter realignment strategic realignment total severance and employment related charges facilities and equipment costs ibm transaction strategic realignment other total facilities and equipment charges write off of abandoned technology costs to exit database commitments professional fees and other total merger  realignment and other charges the merger  realignment and other charges for ascential software and informix software recorded during are described below

also during  as a result of strategic realignment activities undertaken during and prior merger and realignment activities  we also recorded charges of million for severance and employment related costs  million for facilities and equipment costs  million to complete the exit from a commitment related to the database business and million for ongoing professional fees related to the realignment 
v 
other income expense ascential software corporation the following table depicts the components of other income and expense for ascential software corporation for the years ended december   and years ended december  in millions interest income interest expense gain on sale of database business  net of adjustments impairment of long term investments other income  net interest income years ended december   and interest income for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million during this decrease is attributable to three factors 
first  the year ended december  includes million of interest income on the ibm holdback see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ibm holdback was paid in full in january  at which time the related interest income  which accrued at a rate of per annum  was no longer payable 
second  the annual composite rate of return on cash and investments has declined by approximately basis points as a result of the general economic environment and prevailing interest rates 
third  average cash balances have declined in principally as a result of the cash paid in connection with the mercator acquisition 
interest income for the year ended december  was million less than the amount for the same period in this is a result of an approximate decline in average rates of return on cash and investments as a result of the drop in interest rates that occurred during the year 
however  this decline in interest rates is offset by our higher average cash and investment balances during our cash and investment balances were higher  on a quarterly average  for the year ended december  compared with the same period in because the proceeds from the ibm transaction were not received until the third quarter of additionally  interest income includes approximately million in for interest accrued during the year on the million holdback associated with the ibm transaction included in receivable from sale of the database business at december  while only million in interest accrued on the holdback during interest expense years ended december   and interest expense for the year ended december  relates principally to the outstanding mercator loan agreement for which the company became responsible as a consequence of the mercator acquisition the mercator loan agreement and interest on capital leases 
the principal balance under the mercator loan agreement was repaid by september  and therefore will not recur in subsequent periods

gain on sale of database business  net of adjustments years ended december   and during the quarter ended september   we completed the ibm transaction 
in connection with this sale of our database business assets to ibm  a gain of million was recorded in the year ended december  during  we recorded a net increase of million to the gain on sale of database business 
the million net increase was comprised of a million increase due to the completion of the final audit of the working capital transferred to ibm partially offset by a million payment to ibm to resolve informal matters raised by ibm related to the ibm transaction  a million decrease for administrative and professional fees required to dissolve subsidiaries rendered as inactive as a consequence of the ibm transaction and a million decrease related to adjustments to the working capital transferred to ibm 
there were no adjustments to the gain during impairment of long term investments years ended december   and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our assessments  we realized a loss of million during and million during for declines in value that were considered other than temporary 
as of december   the remaining book value of long term investments was approximately million 
we did not realize a loss due to these long term investments in  however  given the rapid changes occurring in the business sectors in which our strategic investments operate  additional impairment charges are possible in the future 
other  net years ended december   and other  net  for the year ended december  totaled income of million and consists of million in income associated with a reversal of severance related liabilities recorded in connection with the ibm transaction that were determined to no longer be required  and million in gains realized on investments offset by million in net foreign exchange losses  including a million credit of cumulative translation adjustment recorded to other income related to the liquidation of a subsidiary 
we continue to liquidate various subsidiaries that were active prior to the ibm transaction but that are no longer required for our ongoing operations and continue to evaluate our subsidiary structure as deemed appropriate to match business needs 
as these subsidiaries become substantially liquidated  the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recorded on our balance sheet in connection with the historical monthly revaluation of their assets and liabilities will be recorded as other income or expense 
other  net for the year ended december  totaled a loss of million 
the most significant contributing factors consisted of million in net foreign exchange losses related principally to the revaluation of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar primarily argentina  mexico and brazil  million in net realized gains on short term investments and million in income from the proceeds received in connection with the favorable outcome of litigation during the year 
for  other expense included approximately million of net foreign currency transaction losses offset primarily by million of rent on subleased facilities in excess of our obligations to landlords  a gain of approximately million on the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and million of net realized gains on the sale of a long term investment

income taxes ascential software corporation years ended december  in millions  other than percentages income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit effective tax rate not meaningful for the year ended december   a tax benefit of million was recorded 
this amount includes a benefit of million resulting from adjustments that were recorded to reflect the impact of closed tax audits  expiring statutes of limitations for the assessment of tax  and changes in estimates resulting from additional or new information related to certain tax accruals 
the total tax benefit recorded is net of an accrual for state income taxes and a change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
additionally  during  we incurred a million charge for in process research and development associated with the mercator acquisition that is nondeductible for tax purposes 
during  we realized a tax benefit on losses generated at a rate that was less than the statutory rate of approximately 
this was due to the impact of the us alternative minimum tax on the carryback of us net operating losses and the impact of income taxes and withholding taxes owed in foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense in was primarily attributable to taxable gains in the united states and foreign jurisdictions resulting from the gain from the ibm transaction 
the income tax expense on the gain resulting from the ibm transaction was calculated after the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously fully reserved

at december   cash was million and short term investments was million 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million and consisted of million in cash and million of short term investments 
the million increase in cash and short term investments for the year ended december  consists of cash proceeds from financing activities of million  the positive effect of exchange rates on cash balances of million and million related to other sources  partially offset by cash used for operations of million 
the net cash proceeds of million for financing activities consisted of million of proceeds received through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock primarily for options exercised and for purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  net of million of payments on debt assumed in the mercator transaction 
these debt payments consist of a payment of million to extinguish a line of credit assumed as part of the mercator acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of payments to extinguish other financing arrangements assumed at the date of the acquisition 
cash used for operations during included cash payments of million related to merger  realignment and other costs 
these merger  realignments and other costs consist of million of cash payments related to the mercator acquisition  million of cash payments related to the ibm transaction and million due to various restructuring actions we took during  and during the year ended december   cash payments for severance paid to former mercator employees was million  cash payments related to mercator facilities that are no longer in use amounted to million and other exit payments related to mercator were million 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we anticipate that substantially all severance payments and related employee costs of million due to the purchase of mercator will be paid out by the end of if we are unable to negotiate termination of our lease obligations for the mercator facilities before the end of the respective lease terms  the mercator facility exit costs will continue until the termination of the leases which expire at various dates through we do not expect future charges related to undiscounted mercator lease obligations  excluding estimated sublease income  to exceed million  the maximum remaining unaccrued obligation under existing contractual lease terms 
in addition  during the year ended december   we made million in cash payments  net of cash received from sublease arrangements  for facilities costs related to the company s vacant  or partially vacant facilities as a result of the ibm transaction 
these payments are expected to continue until we can negotiate termination of the lease obligations or until the leases expire at various dates from through cash payments of million related to our restructuring actions taken during  and were primarily for severance payments that are expected to be substantially paid by the end of the net million of cash and short term investments related to other sources during was due primarily to the receipt of million from ibm  net of million related to the purchase of mercator  cash expenditures of million for property and equipment  additions to software development costs of million and purchases of strategic investments of million 
as part of the ibm transaction  ibm retained million of the sale proceeds as a holdback the holdback to satisfy the indemnification obligations that might arise under the ibm transaction purchase agreement 
the million payment from ibm consisted of million for the holdback plus million of interest on the holdback see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the payment of million for the purchase of mercator consisted of a cash payment of million for the outstanding shares of mercator  net of million of cash held by mercator at the time of the closing of the transaction 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled million 
we currently plan to continue to invest in research and development activities as well as sales and marketing and product support 
our investment in property and equipment is expected to continue  barring unforeseen circumstances  as we purchase computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  and support and administrative staff 
as of december   we did not have any significant long term debt or significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash and short term investments balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our research and development initiatives for at least the next twelve months 
we also believe that we will have sufficient resources to continue to fund repurchases of common stock under the announced million stock repurchase program  and to fund the costs of current and future facilities  severance and other obligations associated with the ibm transaction in addition to current and future restructuring initiatives

the following table presents our other commercial commitments as of december  in millions amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total less than year years years after years lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total contractual cash obligations in may and november  we entered into standby letters of credit that expire by may and november  respectively  and guarantees million of potential tax payments related to certain payments made to two of our former officers 
these potential tax payments  which have been partially reserved based on management s assessment of the potential payments and relate to severance paid to these former officers in accordance with a change in control agreement that was triggered as part of the ibm transaction 
payment under the standby letter of credit would be due upon final assessment of this tax liability 
in addition  we were also required to enter into standby letters of credit to guarantee approximately million of lease payments for certain facilities in europe 
these guarantees do not have expiration dates and would allow landlords to obtain lease payments from our bank if we were to default on our lease payment obligations 
during the company issued a million standby letter of credit to guarantee certain lease obligations pursuant to the lease between mercator and the landlord of an office facility located in wilton  connecticut 
the letter of credit is automatically extended annually  but not beyond july  disclosures about market rate risk market rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
although we intend to utilize our fixed income investments to fund operations and acquisitions as needed  we currently have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and believe that the effect  if any  of potential near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have an immaterial impact on the value of these securities in foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
as these contracts are not designated as hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are recorded in earnings to other income expense  net at the time of purchase  and changes in market value of the underlying contract are recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gains or losses in the period in which they occur 
we operate in certain countries in eastern europe and asia pacific and are winding down operations in latin america where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we may have un hedged exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates in our pricing strategy  there would be a time lapse between any sudden or significant exchange rate movements and our implementation of a revised pricing structure 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the length of our average sales cycle which depends on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 
since these contracts were entered into on the last day of the contract forward rate and the market forward rate are the same 
all contracts mature within three months 
in addition to the contracts listed below  at december   we had accrued  as a component of accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  a gain of million related to the fair market value of forward currency contracts that had closed as of december  but were not settled until january  forward contracts at december  contract amount contract rate in thousands forward currency to be sold under contract swiss franc  singapore dollar  korean won   norwegian krona  brazilian pesos  australian dollar  slovak  koruna  other individually less than million  total  forward currency to be purchased under contract british pound  euro dollar  other individually less than million  total  grand total  recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements factors that may affect future results if we do not make effective use of the proceeds of our substantial cash resources  our financial results could suffer and the value of our common stock could decline 
our ability to increase stockholder value is dependent  in part  on our effective use of the cash proceeds from the sale of our database business assets to ibm  including the million ibm holdback  plus interest  released to us in january at december   as a result of the ibm transaction and our continuing operations  we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we intend to use the proceeds to continue to operate our business  repurchase shares of our common stock and to finance any strategic acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that these measures will improve our financial results or increase stockholder value 
if we are unable to increase revenue from  and expand the market share of  our products  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
if we do not increase sales of our enterprise data integration products  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
our revenue is currently derived almost entirely from our enterprise data integration suite 
in order to increase revenues and grow our business  we must be able to increase sales of these products and our share of the enterprise data integration market 
we cannot ensure that our current customers will continue to purchase our data integration product offerings and related services and that new customers will choose our solutions over our competitors product offerings 
if the enterprise data integration market declines or does not grow  we may sell fewer products and services and our business may be unable to sustain its current level of operations 
if the growth rates for the enterprise data integration market decline for any reason  there will be a decrease in demand for our products and services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have invested substantial resources in developing data integration products and services to compete in this market 
the market for these products and services is evolving  and its growth depends upon an increasing need to store and manage complex data and upon broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
declining demand for our products and services could threaten our ability to sustain our present level of operations and meet our expectations for future growth 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors which could impair our ability to sell our products 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive  diverse and subject to rapid change 
in particular  we expect that the technology underlying our products and services will continue to change rapidly 
it is possible that our products and solutions will be rendered obsolete by technological advances achieved by our competitors 
we currently face intense competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market applications  development tools  decision support products  consulting services and or complete database driven solutions for the internet 
other vendors that offer etl functionality include  among others  informatica  sas  business objects  oracle and cognos 
we also face competition from private companies such as eti  as well as various enterprise software vendors who have embedded etl capabilities  and companies own internal development resources 
principal competitors relative to our ascential datastage offering include vendors such as informatica  as well as enterprise software vendors who have embedded etl capabilities  and companies own internal development resources 
competitors for ascential profilestage  our data profiling offering  include avellino and evoke 
competitors for ascential qualitystage  our data quality offering  include firstlogic  group one and trillium 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies  evolving markets and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  market consolidations could create more formidable competitors 
competition may affect the pricing of our products or services and changes in product mix may occur  either of which may reduce our profit margins 
existing and future competition or changes in our product or service offerings or pricing could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
in addition  a significant change in the mix of software products and services that we sell  including the mix between higher margin software and maintenance products and lower margin consulting and education  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future periods 
in addition  the pricing strategies of competitors in the software industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the prices of their products 
our current strategy contemplates possible future acquisitions  which will require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits 
on november   we completed the acquisition of torrent  on april  we completed the acquisition of vality and on september   we completed the acquisition of mercator 
we consummated each transaction with the expectation that it would result in mutual benefits including  among other things  expanded and complementary product offerings  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of strategic personnel 
our business strategy contemplates the possibility of future acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies 
any potential acquisition may result in significant transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we were to make a cash acquisition of substantial scale  it could reduce our cash reserves and affect our liquidity and capital resources 
achieving the benefits of any acquisition will depend in part on our ability to integrate an acquired business with our business in a timely and efficient manner 
our consolidation of operations following any acquisition may require significant attention from our management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve expected net sales  operating expenses and operating results for any acquired business 
we cannot ensure that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits  our operating performance could suffer 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results 
our quarterly and annual financial results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  if a large number of the orders that are typically booked at the end of a quarter are not booked  our net income for that quarter could be substantially below expectations 
in addition  the failure to meet market expectations could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
these and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  including changes in growth rates in the software industry as a whole and in the enterprise data integration market  the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products and services  possible delays in or inability to recognize revenue as the result of revenue recognition rules  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business  changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors  or other factors  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services  unexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns 
our recognition of deferred revenue is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods 
the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations that may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from selling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to the companies businesses or financial results 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  including threats of terrorism  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause a drop in the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a number of reasons  including market uncertainty about our business prospects or the prospects for the enterprise data integration market  revenues or results of operations that do not meet or exceed analysts and investors expectations  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  any challenges integrating people  operations or products associated with recent acquisitions  general business conditions in the software industry  the technology sector  or in the domestic or international economies  and uncertainty and economic instability resulting from terrorist acts and other acts of violence or war 
our financial success depends upon our ability to maintain and leverage relationships with strategic partners 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic relationships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who are able to market our products and services effectively 
our ability to increase the sales of our products and our future success depends in part upon maintaining and increasing relationships with strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on relationships with a variety of strategic partners  including systems integrators  resellers and distributors in the united states and abroad 
further  we have become more reliant upon resellers in international areas in which we do not have a direct sales team 
our strategic partners may offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
in addition  our strategic partners may acquire businesses or product lines that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products 
if our strategic partners do not devote adequate resources for implementation of our products and services  we will incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to implement solutions for our customers 
in addition  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop and support these relationships 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel and attract and retain the new personnel necessary to grow our businesses  which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products  support our business operations and grow our business 
the competition for experienced  well qualified personnel in the software industry is intense 
our future success depends on retaining the services of key personnel in all functional areas of our company  including engineering  sales  marketing  consulting and corporate services 
for instance  we may be unable to continue to develop and support technologically advanced products and services if we fail to retain and attract highly qualified engineers  and to market and sell those products and services if we fail to retain and attract well qualified marketing and sales professionals 
we may be unable to retain key employees in all of these areas and we may not succeed in attracting new employees 
in addition  from time to time we may acquire other companies 
in order to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition we may need transitional or permanent assistance from key employees of the acquired company 
if we fail to retain  attract and motivate key employees  including those of companies that we acquire  we may be unable to develop  market and sell new products and services  which could materially adversely affect our operating and financial results 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
despite efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  particularly in hyper inflationary countries where hedging is not available or practical 
as a consequence  we may incur losses in connection with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates in our pricing strategy  there would be a time lapse between any sudden or significant exchange rate movements and our implementation of a revised pricing structure 
accordingly  we may have substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products are relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
we have a foreign exchange hedging program that is intended to hedge the value of intercompany accounts receivable or intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  revenues from our products and solutions may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce commercially viable enhancements to our existing and acquired products and services on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
if we do not enhance our products and services to meet these evolving needs  we will not license or sell as many products and services and our position in existing  emerging or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by other product advances 
in addition  commercial acceptance of our products and services also could be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and the media about us or our products or business  or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or by other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial financial and operational investment 
we may not be able to internally develop new products and services quickly enough to respond to market forces 
as a result  we may have to acquire technology or access to products or services through mergers and acquisitions  investments and partnering arrangements  any of which may require us to use significant financial resources 
alternatively  we may not be able to forge partnering arrangements or strategic alliances on satisfactory terms  or at all  with the companies of our choice 
our future revenue and our ability to make investments in developing our products is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license our products and renew our service agreements 
we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  our revenue will decline 
our maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase or license additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue also depends upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base  including the customers of acquired companies 
any downturn in software license revenue could result in lower services revenue in current or future quarters 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results  and our lengthy sales cycles for products makes our revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales of software products and services have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends that materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
revenue and operating results in our first quarter are typically lower relative to other quarters because many customers make purchase decisions for the fourth quarter based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements  and as a new year begins start planning for  but not implementing  new information technology spending until later in the year 
in addition  revenue and operating results in our third quarter may be adversely affected by scheduling conflicts due to vacations and holidays  particularly abroad 
our sales cycles typically take many months to complete and vary depending on the product or service that is being sold 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
the sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through resellers and third party distributors 
the success of our international operations is dependent upon many factors that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and could affect our profitability 
international sales represent approximately of our total revenue 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and  therefore  our profitability  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  recessionary environments in domestic or foreign economies and increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by countries  and other changes in applicable foreign laws 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks which would weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our business success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting proprietary rights may not be adequate  and the inability to protect intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and or financial condition 
we currently hold a number of united states patents and pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will be issued or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringements 
our ability to sell or license our products and services and to prevent competitors from misappropriating our proprietary technology and trade names is dependent upon protecting our intellectual property 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
we also have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of our source code to the customer in the event of bankruptcy  insolvency  or discontinuation of our business or support of a product line  in each case where support and maintenance of the product line is not assumed by a third party 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights in software to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our software may have defects and errors  which may lead to a loss of revenue or product liability claims 
software products are internally complex and occasionally contain defects or errors  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite extensive testing  we may not detect errors in our new products  platforms or product enhancements until after we have commenced commercial shipments 
if defects and errors are discovered in our existing or acquired products  platforms or product enhancements after commercial release then potential customers may delay or forego purchases  our reputation in the marketplace may be damaged  we may incur additional service and warranty costs  and we may have to divert additional development resources to correct the defects and errors 
if any or all of the foregoing occur  we may lose revenues or incur higher operating expenses and lose market share  any of which could severely harm our financial condition and operating results 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
the loss of our rights to use software licensed to us by third parties could harm our business 
in order to provide a complete product suite  we occasionally license software from third parties  and sub license this software to our customers 
in addition  we license software programs from third parties and incorporate these programs into our own software products 
by utilizing third party software in our business  we incur risks that are not associated with developing software in house 
for example  these third party providers may discontinue or alter their operations  terminate their relationship with us  impose license restrictions or generally become unable to fulfill their obligations to us 
if any of these circumstances were to occur  we may be forced to seek alternative technology that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
in the future  we may be forced to obtain additional third party software licenses to enhance our product offerings and compete more effectively 
we may not be able to obtain and maintain licensing rights to needed technology on commercially reasonable terms  which would harm our business and operating results 
we have substantial real estate lease commitments for unoccupied space and restoration obligations  and if we are unable to sublet this space on acceptable terms our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are party to real estate leases for a total of approximately  square feet 
at december   we actively utilized approximately of this space  or  square feet 
at december   approximately  or  square feet  was currently unoccupied or sublet to a third party 
approximately and of the space occupied and unoccupied  respectively  is due to space acquired through the purchase of mercator 
without taking into account any mercator leases  ascential is party to real estate leases for approximately  square feet that we actively utilize  and approximately  square feet that is currently unoccupied or sublet to a third party 
at december   we have a restructuring reserve of million associated with these leases comprised of million for lease obligations and million for restoration costs related to the disposition of this space as of december  in establishing this reserve  we have assumed that we will be able to sublet the available space and receive approximately million of sublease income relating to this space  million for properties already sublet and million from properties where a sublet is anticipated 
we may not be able to sublet this space on the assumed terms and restoration costs may exceed our estimates 
if we are unable to sublet this space on the assumed terms  or if restoration costs exceed our estimates  there may be an adverse effect on our operating results of up to million resulting from additional restructuring costs 
additionally  as a result of the mercator acquisition we have become party to additional real estate leases for approximately  square feet that will be actively utilized  and approximately  square feet that is currently unoccupied or sublet to a third party 
at the date of the mercator acquisition we assumed a liability of million that mercator previously established as a restructuring charge for facilities that they were partially occupying 
upon the consummation of the acquisition  we made a decision to vacate certain of these mercator facilities entirely and  accordingly  recorded an additional reserve in purchase accounting of million 
the million is primarily comprised of the lease obligations for these facilities through the year at december   we have a restructuring reserve of million  primarily for future lease and lease related obligations 
in establishing these reserves  we have assumed that we will be able to sublet the available space and receive approximately million of sublease income relating to this space  million for properties already sublet and million from properties where a sublet is anticipated 
we may not be able to sublet this space on the assumed terms and restoration costs may exceed our estimates 
if we are unable to sublet this space on the assumed terms  or if restoration costs exceed our estimates  there may be an adverse effect on our operating results of up to million resulting from additional restructuring costs 
our inability to rely on the statutory safe harbor for certain prior periods as a result of the settlement of the securities and exchange commission investigation could harm our business 
effective january   informix entered into a settlement with the sec as a result of an investigation 
pursuant to the settlement  informix consented to the entry by the sec of an order instituting public administrative proceedings pursuant to section a of the securities act of and section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order 
pursuant to the order  informix neither admitted nor denied the findings  except as to jurisdiction  contained in the order 
the order prohibits us from violating and causing any violation of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  for example by making materially false and misleading statements concerning our financial performance 
the order also prohibits us from violating or causing any violation of the provisions of the federal securities laws requiring us to file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the sec  maintain accurate accounting books and records  and maintain adequate internal accounting controls 
pursuant to the order  we are also required to cooperate in the sec s continuing investigation of other entities and persons 
in the event that we violate the order  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties 
as a consequence of the issuance of the january order  we were not  for the three year period expiring on january   able to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the federal securities laws 
the safe harbor  among other things  limits potential legal actions against us in the event a forward looking statement concerning our anticipated performance turns out to be inaccurate  unless it can be proved that  at the time the statement was made  we actually knew that the statement was false 
if we become a defendant in any private securities litigation brought under the federal securities laws pertaining to that three year period  our legal position in the litigation could be materially adversely affected by our inability to rely on the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisition bids and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
this could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
the provisions include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting  certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings and a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock  and consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt which has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirers from making unsolicited acquisition bids 
provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to approximately four million shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting controls to others 
delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
we are incorporated in delaware and are subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including us  whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination would include  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving us and an interested stockholder and the sale of more than of our assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the anti takeover provisions 
we have not and do not intend to opt out of these anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war  may affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively disrupt and negatively impact our operations 
we are unable to predict whether there will be future terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses  or against other countries or businesses located in those countries 
these attacks may directly impact our physical facilities and those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make the travel of our employees more difficult and expensive and ultimately may affect our sales 
also  as a result of terrorism or for other reasons  the united states may enter into an armed conflict that could have a further impact on our sales and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also negatively impact our business generated in those regions 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business
