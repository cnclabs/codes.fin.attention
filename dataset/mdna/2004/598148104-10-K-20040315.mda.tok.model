item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we develop and publish interactive entertainment software 
videogames for play on home consoles or handheld devices are sold to mass merchants  video rental retailers and entertainment software distributors 
we sell games primarily in north america  europe and australia for the major videogame platforms  including sony s playstation computer entertainment system  microsoft s xbox and nintendo s gamecube and game boy advance 
most of our videogames have suggested retail prices on the initial release date ranging from to for console games and from to for handheld games 
we have experienced operating losses since our fiscal year ended june  in order to address this issue  we have implemented several restructuring plans  the most recent of which is described below 
during the second half of  we refocused our product strategy to i build games for mature gamers  ii build over the top sports games and iii build games that leverage our proven intellectual properties and franchises 
we are focusing our product development and marketing resources to build fewer  higher quality games with more marketing support than in the past 
we are structuring our product release schedules and product launch timing to best position our products against their competition 
we also plan to increase pre launch awareness and visibility of our games with consumers through increased spending on media advertising and retail marketing 
in addition  during  we completed several financing transactions and hired a new chief executive officer to support and execute our refocused strategy 
all of these efforts are designed to reverse the trend of large losses that we experienced in recent fiscal periods by reducing losses significantly in and eventually returning us to profitability 
restructuring late in  we reviewed our year to date performance  our plan for and the corresponding proposed staffing levels 
we determined that we would reduce costs and consolidate operations in order to generate improved results in future periods 
in december  we decided to reduce the amount of leased space used in our milpitas  california facility and terminate a group of mostly product development employees in both our milpitas and san diego  california facilities 
during the first quarter of  we decided to terminate additional employees 
the reduction in personnel associated with the milpitas studio required us to reduce the scope of our product development efforts 
accordingly  three games in development at that time were cancelled due to the reduction in product development resources and our judgment about their prospects resulting in a charge of  during fiscal during the second quarter of  we decided that rather than just reducing the size of the milpitas operation  it was advisable to consolidate almost all of its operations into existing facilities in san diego and chicago  illinois 
we recorded charges related to lease commitments for which we will receive no future economic benefit  fixed asset impairments and other costs of  during fiscal related to this decision 
the total number of employees expected to be terminated from these reductions is  of which had been terminated as of december   resulting in restructuring charges of  for fiscal we experienced lower research and development costs in fiscal resulting from this decision 
see results of operations following 
the fiscal restructuring amounts were partially offset by reversals to previously accrued restructuring charges of  related to changes in estimates of severance costs and sublease income 
financing transactions during may  we sold  shares of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for  in a private placement resulting in proceeds of  net of issuance costs 
in conjunction with the sale of the series c preferred stock  we redeemed the remaining  shares of outstanding series b redeemable convertible preferred stock at the stated value of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
during october  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  additionally  in october  all of the series c preferred stock and related warrants and purchase rights were exchanged for series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and related warrants and purchase rights

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to our business operations 
the interpretation of these policies requires management judgments and estimates of matters which ultimately may differ from actual results 
for a discussion of our other significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the software is delivered  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the customer receivable is probable 
we do not provide any significant customization of software or post contract support 
if consumer demand for a product falls below expectations  we may grant price protection to spur further sales or accept product returns 
therefore  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts 
price protection  returns and discounts we may grant price protection or discounts to  or allow product returns from  our customers under certain conditions 
therefore  we record an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts at each balance sheet date 
price protection means credits relating to retail price markdowns on our products previously sold by us to customers 
we base these allowances on expected trends and estimates of potential future price protection  product returns and discounts related to current period product revenue 
several factors are used in developing these estimates  including a prior experience with price protection  returns and discounts  b historical and expected sell through rates for particular games  c historical and expected rates of requests for such credits  d specific identification of problem accounts  e existing field inventories  f shipments by geography as price protection  returns and discounts experience differs by geography  g terms of sale  h sales rates or trends for similar products  i consideration of price points that would encourage future sell through at the retail level and corresponding price protection credits that would be granted to appropriate customers  j the net price paid by our customers for products on which previous price protection has been granted and k other relevant factors 
sell through refers to consumer purchases of our product at retail from our customers 
actual price protection  product returns and discounts may materially differ from our estimates as our products are subject to changes in consumer preferences  technological obsolescence due to new platforms  or competing products 
changes in these factors could change our judgments and estimates and result in variances in the amount of allowance required 
this may impact the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
for example  if customers request price protection in amounts exceeding the rate expected and if management agrees to grant it  then we may incur additional charges 
during fiscal   the six months ended december  and fiscal  we recorded provisions for price protection  returns and discounts of    and  respectively 
such amounts are reflected in revenues 
our accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for future price protection and discounts to be issued and future product returns to be accepted from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for price protection  returns and discounts were  and  respectively 
we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential price protection  returns and discounts 
doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we analyze significant customer accounts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  we may record allowances for doubtful accounts related to customers based on length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  financial health of the customer and historical experience 
this analysis requires management to make estimates of collectibility which may materially differ from actual collections 
if circumstances related to our customers change  the amount and timing of bad debt expense for any period may be impacted 
during fiscal   the six months ended december  and fiscal  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of    and  respectively 
such amounts are included in administrative expense 
our accounts receivable balance is reported in the consolidated balance sheets net of an allowance for doubtful accounts from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for doubtful accounts were  and  there were no significant unreserved amounts of doubtful accounts receivable with any major customers or classes of customers at december  we believe this allowance is adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of doubtful accounts 
capitalized software development our capitalized product development costs principally consist of software development costs for videogames that will be sold to consumers through retailers 
we account for software development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed by us when incurred and are included in research and development expense 
once a software product has reached technological feasibility  all subsequent software development costs for that product are capitalized until that product is released for sale 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis and can occur early in the development cycle or later depending on required technology to complete the product and the availability of such technology to us 
after a product is released  the capitalized product development costs are amortized to expense based on the ratio of current sales to the total of current plus projected future sales for each game 
this expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a product by product basis 
capitalized costs for products that are cancelled are expensed in the period of cancellation 
in addition  a charge to cost of sales is recorded when our forecast for a particular game indicates that unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value of that asset 
the net realizable value is the estimated future revenues from that game reduced by the estimated future cost of completing and selling the game 
if a revised game sales forecast is less than management s current game sales forecast  or if actual game sales are less than management s forecast  it is possible we could accelerate the amortization of software development costs previously capitalized 
as a result  the forecasted sales for a given game are a sensitive factor in this calculation 
critical factors evaluated in estimating forecasted sales include  among other things historical sales of similar titles  pre launch awareness  game ratings from publications and websites  current demand and sell through rates 
management judgments and estimates are used in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts of capitalized product development costs  research and development expense or cost of sales 
during fiscal   the six months ended december  and fiscal  we recorded capitalized product development cost impairment charges in cost of sales and  where appropriate  restructuring and other charges of    and  respectively 
our capitalized product development costs balances at december  and were  and  respectively 
we believe our capitalized product development costs balance at december  is recoverable from future revenue activity 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  are reviewed for other than temporary impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the amount of the asset reflected in our balance sheet may not be recoverable 
when certain events or changes in circumstances occur  an estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate group of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
historically  long lived asset impairment charges  other than those incurred as a result of restructuring activities  have not been significant 
the net book value of property and equipment at december  and was  and  respectively 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
future operating performance is affected by sales of our products and ability to meet product release schedules 
the actual cash flows could materially differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
this may preclude us from realizing the future cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets resulting in an impairment charge recorded in the future 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  we evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
in addition  sfas requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use october as our annual measurement date and use market capitalization as an initial indicator of the fair value for the company 
we completed our current annual impairment test on october  and found no indicators of impairment of goodwill 
as a result  we did not recognize an impairment loss 
the net book value of goodwill at december  and was  future goodwill impairment tests may result in a material charge to earnings if  for example  our enterprise fair value falls below our net book value 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance for the realization of deferred tax assets  resulting primarily from tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of tax loss carryforward expected to be used within the carryforward period is limited to sources of future taxable income that are more likely than not to be generated within the carryforward period 
the valuation allowance recorded is a reduction to the deferred tax asset  with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations 
in the event we determine that we will realize our deferred tax asset in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an increase to the net deferred tax asset would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
generating taxable income in subsequent periods and changes in estimates of future taxable income could affect the amounts of the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
stockholder ownership change s  as defined under section of the internal revenue code  may limit the annual amount of net operating loss carryforward we may use to offset future taxable income

results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results in dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and amounts for the years ended december  and have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
amounts for the comparable year ended december  are unaudited

fiscal compared with fiscal the following table sets forth our total revenues by platform and territory for the periods indicated dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  revenues by platform sony playstation ps   microsoft xbox xbx   nintendo gamecube ngc   nintendo game boy advance gba   sony playstation psx   other   home video   coin operated video  total revenues   revenues by territory north america   international   total revenues   north american revenues decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal we released videogames in north america during fiscal which represented  of revenue versus videogames released in north america during fiscal which represented  of revenue 
the decrease in revenues was due to releasing the latest version of our highly successful mortal kombat franchise in north america during and a decrease in the number of new releases from the prior year 
during the second quarter of  we made a decision to add more time and effort to the development of several games and to cancel one game that was in production 
as a result of this decision  the release dates for several games were moved out of the third quarter of and into subsequent quarters  including quarters in while these operational decisions had an impact on revenues  we believe that lengthening product development schedules will give us the opportunity to enhance the product quality of future games to be released  which we believe is crucial to generating revenues given the highly competitive nature of our industry and the continuous introduction of new titles to the marketplace 
because of these factors  we expect north american revenues for fiscal to be higher than north american revenues for fiscal our top selling videogames for fiscal in north america included mlb slugfest  spyhunter and nfl blitz pro all for the ps console released in  as well as continued sales from our release of mortal kombat deadly alliance for the ps and xbx consoles 
international revenues increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase in revenues is due to the international release of mortal kombat deadly alliance for the ps  xbx and ngc consoles  as well as for gba handheld devices  during the first quarter of our top selling videogames for fiscal outside of north america included mortal kombat deadly alliance for the ps  xbx and ngc consoles  as well as for gba handheld devices  and freestyle metal x for the ps console 
cost of sales includes product costs  distribution costs  royalties  and amortization and writedowns of capitalized product development costs 
gross profit decreased  from a profit of  for fiscal to a loss of  for fiscal this decrease is due to decreases in sales volume of approximately and in average per unit selling prices of approximately 
the lower average selling price is the result of a greater portion of fiscal revenues being derived from games released in prior years  which typically have lower price points in the current year than new releases 
in addition  there were several new releases in fiscal  including new intellectual properties as well as a budget title  that were introduced at lower selling points to attract consumer interest 
amortization and writedowns of capitalized product development costs  the largest portion of costs of sales  was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
included in these amounts are writedowns of capitalized product development costs  contributing to the decrease in gross margins 
aggregate writedowns of capitalized product development costs excluding amounts included in restructuring and other charges totaled  in fiscal we lowered our sales forecasts for several games in development resulting in a  writedown of capitalized product development costs   of which relates to costs capitalized on games to be released in in addition  we cancelled development on games during resulting in a  writedown of capitalized development costs 
this compares to aggregate writedowns in the prior year of  resulting from changes in sales forecasts for certain games resulting in charges of  and cancellation of one game resulting in a charge of  research and development expense decreased  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease reflects reduced overhead costs after the restructuring efforts described in the overview above 
we are focusing on producing fewer titles per year yet increasing our product development spending per title to produce better quality games 
the net impact of these factors resulted in lower research and development expense from fiscal for console titles introduced during fiscal  the cost of development averaged approximately million per title  consistent with console titles introduced during fiscal selling and marketing expense decreased  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease is due to new releases in fiscal compared to new releases in the prior year 
as described in the overview above  although we anticipate releasing fewer titles in future years  we plan to increase pre launch awareness of our games and increase advertising support of our games  including television  print and on line advertising 
administrative expense increased  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase in administrative expense was due to severance expense related to neil d 
nicastro and increased charges related to legal proceedings of approximately  compared to the prior year 
during may  david f 
zucker succeeded neil d 
nicastro as our chief executive officer and president 
as a result of this event  severance provisions of mr 
nicastro s employment agreement were triggered and mr 
nicastro entered into a severance agreement with us 
under the terms of an employment agreement and severance agreement with mr 
nicastro  administrative expense includes  of charges incurred in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these increases were partially offset by prior year charges of approximately  related to the consolidation of administrative operations located in corsicana with existing operations in chicago 
on a consolidated basis  restructuring and other charges for fiscal totaled  compared to  for fiscal restructuring and other charges of  were recognized during fiscal for discussion of restructuring activities see overview above and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the fiscal charges related to severance of  for terminated employees and  of charges for operating lease commitments for which we will receive no future economic benefit  fixed asset impairments and other charges 
included in the fiscal restructuring and other charges was the impairment of capitalized product development costs of  related to abandonment of titles associated with the consolidation of product development operations 
fiscal amounts were partially offset by reversals to previously accrued restructuring activities in the amount of  related to changes in estimates of severance costs and sublease income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
restructuring and other charges of  were recognized during fiscal these charges related to severance of  for terminated employees and  of charges for operating lease commitments for which we will receive no future economic benefit  fixed asset impairments and other charges 
also included in the other charges was impairment of capitalized product development costs of  related to abandonment of titles associated with the consolidation of product development operations 
prior year amounts were partially offset by reversals to previously accrued restructuring activities in the amount of  related to changes in estimates of sublease income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
operating loss increased  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this increase was due to the  decrease in gross profit and the  employment agreement and severance agreement expense related to neil d 
nicastro included in administrative expense 
these increased costs were partially offset by a  decrease in research and development expenses  a  decrease in selling and marketing expenses and a reduction in restructuring and other charges of  from the prior year 
we provided  and  for income taxes for fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts primarily consisted of deferred tax expense related to goodwill of  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
we are required to record a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets 
given our recent history of book and tax losses  a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax asset  excluding the deferred tax liability specifically related to goodwill  at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
loss applicable to common stock was  or per share  for fiscal compared with a loss of  or per share for fiscal loss applicable to common stock for fiscal included a  distributed dividend and a  imputed dividend on our series c and series d convertible preferred stock or per share and a  distributed dividend and a  imputed dividend on our series b convertible preferred stock or per share 
loss applicable to common stock fiscal included a  distributed dividend and an  imputed dividend on our series b convertible preferred stock or per share 
fiscal compared with twelve months ended december  the following table sets forth our total revenues by platform and territory for the periods indicated dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  unaudited revenues by platform sony playstation   microsoft xbox   nintendo gamecube   nintendo game boy advance   sony playstation   other   home video   coin operated video   total revenues   revenues by territory north america   international   total revenues   home videogame revenues increased from  for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  for fiscal the increase was due to our releasing products in north america during fiscal which represented  of revenue versus releasing products in north america during the comparable twelve months ended december  which represented  of revenue 
the increase in new products was due to our strategy for the platform transition from and bit home videogame consoles to the new generation consoles including sony s playstation  microsoft s xbox  and nintendo s gamecube and nintendo s bit handheld game boy advance  which required significant development efforts before we could release an increased number of games for these new consoles 
our top selling videogames for fiscal included mortal kombat deadly alliance  mlb slugfest  nfl blitz  spyhunter and gauntlet dark legacy 
home videogame gross margin decreased percentage points from for the comparable twelve months ended december  to for fiscal the decrease was due to the underperformance of titles released in the fourth quarter of  including defender  haven call of the king and dr 
muto 
during that quarter  consumer demand was focused on more mature themes while these titles were youth oriented 
as a result  additional reserves were established to provide anticipated price protection in order to stimulate consumer demand and clear the retail channel of inventories 
asset write downs for inventory and capitalized product development costs in fiscal related to these titles totaled  amortization of capitalized product development costs increased to of revenues in fiscal  compared to in the comparable twelve months ended december   due to higher capitalized product development costs associated with game development for the new generation platforms and lower revenues due to the underperformance of titles released in research and development expense decreased  from  for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  for fiscal the decrease was due to increased product development costs capitalized on new generation games and our exit from the coin operated videogame product line 
gross research and development spending increased by  between the two periods  however  the portion of spending we capitalized increased by  during the same two periods 
the development activity and expenditures for home videogames are much greater for new generation platforms than previous platforms 
the newer generation of platforms provides many more capabilities than previous platforms which results in an increased number of people working to develop a more elaborate game and much longer development timelines to finalize a game 
for console titles introduced during fiscal and fiscal  the cost of development averaged approximately million per title  as compared to an average cost per title of approximately million for the new generation titles introduced during fiscal the increase in capitalized software development costs is due to an increase in software development costs being incurred after the point of technological feasibility and attaining technological feasibility earlier in the development process 
all development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized until that product is released for sale 
the new generation platforms are more widely supported by vendors who supply tools which facilitate the attainment of technological feasibility earlier in the development process 
accordingly  with the use of these tools to attain technological feasibility earlier in the development process and the substantial increase in costs required to develop the newer generation games  the amounts capitalized as product development costs have increased 
selling and marketing expense increased  from  of revenues for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  of revenues for fiscal the increase in spending was due to  of additional television and print advertising to promote the higher number of new products released during in addition  we shifted our strategy toward a larger  more expensive promotional campaign  including television and expanded print campaigns  for our mortal kombat deadly alliance release 
sales commissions also increased  from  of revenues for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  of revenues for fiscal due to a change in our mix of customers 
we increased our internet related marketing efforts during fiscal  resulting in an increase of  related to such expenditures 
the decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues from of related revenues in to of related revenues in is due to these costs being spread over significantly increased revenues 
administrative expense decreased  from  for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  for fiscal the comparable twelve months ended december  included  of goodwill amortization of which none was recorded for fiscal pursuant to the adoption of sfas see note to the financial statements included in this report 
the comparable twelve months ended december  also included  of bad debt expense and  of administrative expense related to the exit of the coin operated videogame product line 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
administrative expense in fiscal increased for a number of items  including a  increase in legal expenses related to lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business and a  charge related to the consolidation of administrative operations located in corsicana with existing operations in chicago see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
on a consolidated basis  restructuring and other charges for the comparable twelve months ended december  was  compared to  for fiscal during  we consolidated both product development and administrative departments 
this consolidation was aimed at strategically focusing our efforts on a narrower core group of products 
we believe that several benefits will accrue from the consolidation including lower overhead costs producing more cost efficient operations  greater focus on our key intellectual properties and more flexible staffing of projects due to a concentration of our talent base in fewer locations 
restructuring costs incurred included severance for terminated employees  charges for operating lease space for which we will receive no future economic benefit  fixed asset disposals and various other charges 
the total number of employees expected to be terminated was  of whom had been terminated as of december  these charges totaled  in addition  three games being developed by terminated product development employees were cancelled due to the reduction in resources and our judgment about their prospects 
accordingly  all capitalized product development costs related to these games totaling  were written off in in addition  we recorded a reversal of  of previously accrued restructuring charges related to changes in estimates of sublease income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we exited our coin operated videogame product line in the quarter ended june  although coin operated games were a traditional strength of ours  because of the contraction of the arcade game market we decided to focus on the home videogame market 
the results of this decision included the termination of employees during the twelve months ended december  and resulted in a severance charge of  in addition  fixed assets related to the coin operated videogame product line were written off resulting in a charge of  the restructuring charges also included  of lease commitment costs  for which we will receive no future economic benefit  and administrative costs of  cost savings from exiting the coin operated videogame product line have been used to support the home videogame product line 
operating loss for fiscal was  compared with an operating loss of  for the comparable twelve months ended december  the decrease in the operating loss is due to increased revenues from the release of products on new generation platforms and decreased research and development expense partially offset by increased selling and marketing expenses 
we provided  and for income taxes in fiscal and for the comparable twelve months ended december   respectively 
in fiscal  the income tax expense was the result of a deferred tax expense relating to goodwill 
during fiscal  we received tax refunds totaling  based on net operating loss carryback claims filed with the internal revenue service irs and state taxing authorities 
the  irs tax refunds were the result of tax legislation enacted in march that allowed companies to carryback net operating losses five years where previously they could be carried back two years 
the  state tax refunds were also the result of net operating loss carryback claims 
loss applicable to common stock was  or per share  for fiscal compared with  or per share  for the comparable twelve months ended december  loss applicable to common stock for fiscal reflected a  distributed dividend and an  imputed dividend on our series b convertible preferred stock or per share 
the majority of the  imputed dividend was the result of investors converting  of preferred stock into common stock  accelerating the recognition of imputed preferred stock dividends ie non cash dividends that otherwise would have been recognized in subsequent periods 
loss applicable to common stock for the comparable twelve months ended december  reflected a  distributed dividend and a  imputed dividend on our series b convertible preferred stock or per share 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash is from distribution and sale of our videogames 
our principal uses of cash are for payments associated with both internal and third party developers of our software  third party manufacturers of our videogame inventory and costs incurred to sell and market our videogames 
as of december  our primary source of liquidity was  of cash and cash equivalents  compared with  at december  our working capital at december  totaled  compared with  at december  our cash requirements in recent fiscal periods have been funded through approximately  of net proceeds from financing activities  of which   and  were received in fiscal  the six months ended december  and fiscal  respectively 
our strategy depends on generating revenue from new products 
if our new products fail to gain market acceptance  we may not have sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and to develop a continuous stream of new games 
in march  we entered into a new credit facility of up to  to provide additional liquidity to reach our goals 
under the new credit facility we have a  five year term loan  a revolving line of credit up to  and up to  in letters of credit  which if outstanding  reduce availability under the revolving line of credit 
availability under the line of credit is limited by the borrowing base  which is a function of eligible accounts receivable and collections as defined by the new credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management has the ability  if necessary  to implement further restructuring activities that would substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce capital expenditures  reduce research and development expenditures and or reduce selling and marketing expenditures 
we actively manage our capital structure and balance sheet as a component of our overall business strategy 
we have historically been successful raising capital in the equity markets and may seek to do so in the future if we deem such activity beneficial 
in february  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec in connection with the possible offer and sale  from time to time on a delayed basis  of up to  aggregate amount of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants  rights  units and or stock purchase contracts 
we may issue shares of common stock in the future to settle outstanding obligations such as our redeemable convertible preferred stock  if terms and conditions allow  alleviating cash use requirements 
in addition  under the terms of our agreements with wms  approximately million  which is presently reflected in other non current liabilities on our balance sheet  will become immediately due and payable to wms if we experience a change of control  which includes  among other things  any person or group becoming the beneficial owner  directly or indirectly  of more than of our outstanding voting stock 
we had a letter of credit facility with a bank providing for the availability of up to  of letters of credit  which was terminated upon our entering into a new credit facility with a different bank in march see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there were no letters of credit outstanding at december  and  of letters of credit outstanding at december  during fiscal  cash used by operating  investing  financing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes was  compared with  during fiscal net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the fiscal net loss of  includes non cash charges totaling  including  of depreciation and amortization and  of receivable provisions 
in addition  amortization on capitalized product development costs totaled  for fiscal the amortization of capitalized product development costs includes aggregate writedowns of   of which relates to costs capitalized on games to be released in the current year net loss was further offset by reductions from the prior year in both net receivables and inventories balances of  and  respectively 
these balances were lower at december  than the beginning of the year due to the decreased sales volume experienced in compared to the decreased level of sales volume from to also resulted in an aggregate reduction of current liabilities during as lower levels of items such as trade and royalties payable were outstanding at december  than the beginning of the year  resulting in a net use of cash of  additions to capitalized product development costs totaled  during compared to  during the decrease reflects restructuring efforts to reduce costs as described in the overview above and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we are focusing on producing fewer titles per year but increasing our product development spending per title to produce better quality games  resulting in a decrease in overall spending from during  our chairman of the board  neil nicastro  ceased to serve as our chief executive officer  president and chief operating officer 
other noncurrent liabilities increased  from the beginning of the year as a result of an employment agreement and severance agreement with mr 
nicastro 
see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations below for further details of this liability 
in addition  in august  we received  from wms  pursuant to a settlement agreement dated august   relating to tax sharing and separation agreements between the two companies 
under the tax sharing and separation agreements  we are required to reimburse wms for the majority of this balance under certain circumstances related to our use of our net operating loss carryforwards or if there is a change in control of midway prior to use or expiration of all net operating loss carryforwards  as defined by the agreements
