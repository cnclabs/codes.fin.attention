item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global pharmaceutical company that participates in three healthcare markets blood testing  vaccines and biopharmaceuticals 
our revenues consist of product sales  revenues from a joint business contractual arrangement  collaborative agreement revenues  royalty and license fee revenues and other revenues  primarily consisting of contract manufacturing and grant revenues 
the blood testing segment consists of an alliance with gen probe incorporated and our one half share in the pretax operating earnings generated by the joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  a johnson johnson company 
our alliance with gen probe is focused on developing and commercializing nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology to screen donated blood and plasma products for viral infection 
our joint business arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics is operated under a contractual arrangement and is not a separate and distinct legal entity 
through our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  we sell a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provide supplemental tests and microplate and chemiluminescent instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
the vaccines segment consists of flu vaccines  including fluvirin  a product we obtained as part of our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals discussed below  a meningococcal vaccine  travel vaccines  which include rabies and tick borne encephalitis vaccines and two products we obtained as part of our acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals  arilvax and dukoral  and pediatric and other vaccines 
we sell these vaccines primarily in the us  germany  italy  the united kingdom and other international markets 
our vaccines segment is also involved in the development of other novel vaccines and vaccination technology 
the biopharmaceuticals segment consists of therapeutic products and services  with an emphasis on the treatment of cancer and infectious disease 
our in house capabilities span three types of therapeutics  including small molecules  therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies 
the biopharmaceuticals segment also includes collaborations with berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany  related to betaseron interferon beta b 
we view certain other revenues and expenses as not belonging to any one segment 
as a result  we have aggregated these items into an other segment 
on july   we acquired powderject pharmaceuticals plc  a company based in oxford  england that develops and commercializes vaccines 
we accounted for the acquisition of this business under the purchase method of accounting and included powderject pharmaceuticals operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning july  powderject pharmaceuticals is part of our vaccines segment 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development in in  our income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
in  our income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share 
in  total revenues were  million compared to  million in in  product sales were  million compared to million in  reflecting our acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals during the third quarter total revenues for powderject pharmaceuticals in were million 
powderject pharmaceuticals flu vaccine sales were million in in  our total revenues reflected the benefit of the movement in exchange rates  in particular the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
in  the movement in exchange rates added approximately to our total revenues 
our vaccines segment reflects the greatest impact of the movement in exchange rates  which added approximately to our total vaccines revenues 
similarly  our total euro based expenses increased due to the movement in exchange rates 
in  increases in product sales were seen across all three of our business units  and in particular flu vaccines and procleix products 
our share of revenues from our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics was million compared to million in  up primarily due to a one time benefit in the first quarter from a change in estimate relating to revenues from ortho clinical diagnostics non us affiliate sales  as discussed below 
royalty and license fees  collaborative agreement revenues and other revenues were million in compared to million in  up primarily due to hcv hiv product royalties and license fees from our intellectual property portfolio and betaferon royalties 
in  gross margins decreased to from in  largely due to i changes in the product mix of our three segments and ii additional costs of million in associated with the sale of inventory acquired during the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
these additional costs related to a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
excluding these additional costs  gross margins in would have been 
in particular  vaccine product sales accounted for of total product revenues in up from in  which had a significant impact on gross margins 
in  research and development expenses totaled million  compared to million in research and development expenses for powderject pharmaceuticals were million in the spending reflects our increased level of investment across all three of our segments 
the main beneficiaries of this increase include our meningococcal vaccines franchise  flu cell culture  tifacogin  and interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  there were additional expenses related to the in licensing of daptomycin from cubist pharmaceuticals and purchased in process technology associated with our investment in zymequest inc we are collaborating with zymequest  inc 
to develop and commercialize a enzymatic conversion system which converts group a  b and ab red blood cells to enzyme converted group o eco red blood cells  and costs associated with an agreement with infectio diagnostics inc in which we licensed proprietary nucleic acid based technology for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelets and blood products 
in  selling general and administrative expenses totaled million compared to million in with powderject pharmaceuticals contributing approximately million in the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from additional costs associated with the enhancement of current business processes and headcount  the euro to us dollar exchange rate fluctuation  the expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us  europe and other international markets  the preparation and roll out of the west nile virus assay under ind testing  ongoing sales and marketing programs to support tobi tobramycin in the us and continued market penetration in europe and continued investment in and defense of our patents and technology 
the reported effective tax rate for is of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the powderject pharmaceuticals acquisition 
the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition 
the effective tax rates for and after excluding the impact of the in process research and development charges were and 
the effective tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate due to increased benefits associated with our research and development activities and an increase in income earned in lower tax jurisdictions 
on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  inc  a company that was developing tezacitabine  a drug to treat cancer 
we accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase and included matrix pharmaceutical s operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning on february  matrix pharmaceutical is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged operations in critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  inventories  derivatives  capital leases  intangible assets  goodwill  purchased in process research and development  product discounts  rebates and returns  bad debts  collaborative  royalty and license arrangements  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our blood testing segment includes our one half share in the pretax operating earnings generated by the joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  a johnson johnson company 
our joint business arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics is a contractual arrangement and is not a separate and distinct legal entity 
through our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  we sell a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provide supplemental tests and microplate and chemiluminescent instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
prior to  we had accounted for revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one quarter lag  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of non us affiliate sales of our joint business contractual arrangement became available in the first quarter  and as a result  we are able to recognize revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one month lag 
the effect of this change  net of tax  was an increase to net income by million for revenues from the joint business arrangement for the year ended december  for sales of betaseron interferon beta b  we recognize revenues upon shipment to our marketing partner  schering  and additional revenues upon schering s subsequent sale of betaseron to patients 
upon shipment to schering  we recognize the contractually determined fixed amount of the fee to which we are entitled because at this point  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price due from schering is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
upon receiving the relevant customer sales reports from schering  we recognize the incremental portion of the fee related to schering s shipments to its customers because this portion of the fee is not determinable until receipt of the related sales reports 
we also earn royalties on our marketing partner s european sales of betaferon in those cases where we do not supply the product 
prior to  we had accounted for revenues from non us product sales on a one quarter lag and royalties as a percentage of forecast received from our marketing partner  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of non us betaseron sales became available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize revenues from betaseron product sales and betaferon royalties on a current basis beginning in the first quarter the effect of this change  net of tax  was an increase in net income for the year ended december  by million for product sales and million for royalties 
we believe the following critical accounting policies incorporate our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements purchased in process research and development we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
to assist in determining the value of the in process research and development and certain other intangibles  a third party valuation is typically obtained as of the acquisition date 
we use the income approach to value in process research and development 
the income approach is based on the premise that the value of a security or asset is the present value of the future earning capacity that is available for distribution to the subject investors in the security or asset 
we perform a discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing anticipated revenues  expenses and net cash flow forecasts related to the technology 
given the high risk associated with the development of new drugs  we probability adjust the revenue and expense forecasts to reflect the risk of advancement through the regulatory approval process based on the stage of development in the regulatory process 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe the fair value assigned to the in process research and development is based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available 
for the powderject pharmaceuticals acquisition  we initially allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged to operations in the third quarter in the fourth quarter  upon completion of strategic assessments of the value of certain research and development projects  we revised the allocation of a portion of the purchase price resulting in a million decrease to purchased in process research and development which we credited to operations and which was offset against goodwill 
for the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition  we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged to operations in the first quarter we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the purchased in process research and development 
for the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition  we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to a liability for asset disposal and lease cancellation for the san diego  california facility closed during the third quarter in the fourth quarter  we found an assignee for the manufacturing facility lease and revised the allocation of the purchase price resulting in a million decrease to purchased in process research and development as the residual amount allocated to in process research and development was less than the estimated fair value of the in process research and development  which we credited to operations 
investments we invest in marketable debt and equity securities 
the prices of some of our marketable securities are subject to considerable volatility 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in a marketable security has experienced a decline in fair value  as measured by quoted market prices  that is other than temporary 
generally  we believe that an investment in a marketable security is impaired if its quoted market price has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period  at which point we write down the investment 
however  in determining whether impairment of a marketable security is considered to be other than temporary  we consider all available factors in the evaluation 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  i whether the issuer of the securities is experiencing depressed and declining earnings in relation to competitors  erosion of market share  and deteriorating financial position  ii whether the issuer is experiencing financial difficulties and its market is experiencing difficulties  iii ongoing activity in our collaborations with the issuer  if any  and iv the issuer s prospects for favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
decreases in the fair value of these securities may impact our profitability 
to reduce this risk  we hedge a portion of our equity securities exposure through forward sales contracts 
our marketable debt securities consist of a diversified portfolio of high quality investment grade securities 
we do not hedge our marketable debt securities 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for product failures  expiration and obsolescence 
the manufacturing processes for many of our products are complex 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in failures or recalls and  therefore  additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory  due to the expiration of shelf life  and the seasonal nature of some of our products  may result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the shelf life and the expiration date  ii sales forecasts and iii inventory levels compared to forecasted usage 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales and usage information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to estimate an inventory obsolescence reserve 
in addition  we operate in a highly competitive environment  with rapidly changing technologies 
new technology or changes in production processes may result in product obsolescence 
as a result  we may be required to record additional inventory reserves 
product returns and rebates in estimating returns  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii our experience with similar products  iii current inventory on hand at the distributors and in the distribution channel and the remaining shelf life of that inventory  iv current economic trends  v distributors practices  vi changes in demand  particularly due to the seasonality of certain of our products and vii introduction of new competing products 
in arriving at the allowance for product returns we primarily use one of the following methodologies depending on the product i we match the actual returns to the actual sale on a product by product basis to assess the historical trend for returns  and based on an analysis of the historical trend  the appropriate return percentage for the current period is then applied to current period sales to arrive at the product returns charge against revenue for the period or ii for seasonal products we analyze our actual returns over the previous seasons to arrive at the average actual returns percentage  which is then applied to the current season s sales to arrive at the charge against revenue for the current period 
in estimating rebates  we use historical trends to analyze rebates against revenue on a product by product basis to arrive at an expected rebate percentage 
this expected rebate percentage is applied to current period sales to arrive at the rebates expense for the period 
if actual product returns and rebates are greater than our estimates  additional product return and rebates accruals may be required 
if actual product returns and rebates are less than our estimates  we may have to reverse certain accruals 
collaborative  royalty and license arrangements we recognize up front refundable fees as revenues upon the later of when they become nonrefundable or when performance obligations are completed 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  we defer and amortize up front nonrefundable fees ratably over the performance period  which is typically stipulated by the contract  otherwise  we recognize them as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  there may be significant judgment in separating the different revenue generating activities and in determining whether each is a separate earnings process 
milestones  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished 
the terms of such arrangements may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received or on product sales forecast information provided by the third party licensee 
in the subsequent quarter  we record an adjustment equal to the difference between those estimated royalty revenues recorded in the previous quarter and the contractual percentage of the third party s actual product sales for that period 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the forecast information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns  however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ materially from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for probable exposures 
we maintain an allowance for tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
litigation and other contingencies we establish and maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our accruals on information available internally within the company at the time of such determination and after management has consulted with and obtained advice from external professional advisors 
judgment is required in both the determination of probability and as to whether such an exposure is reasonably estimable 
information may become available to us after that time  for which adjustments to accruals may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
for the powderject pharmaceuticals acquisition  we initially allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill in the third quarter in the fourth quarter  the allocation of the purchase price changed as we completed the strategic assessments of the value of certain research and development projects and adjusted the purchased in process research and development  and upon finalization of certain estimates 
accordingly  goodwill associated with the powderject pharmaceuticals acquisition was adjusted to million in the fourth quarter we are in the process of finalizing certain estimates  thus both the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price are subject to change 
the preliminary purchase price and allocation reflect management s decision to cease operations at the madison wisconsin facility and the swedish facility 
we have accrued approximately million in estimated exit costs associated with these operations 
in addition  we are finalizing certain estimates associated with various other direct acquisition costs 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of our reporting units  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain minor arithmetical variances between the following narrative and the consolidated financial statements may arise due to rounding 
results of operations blood testing product sales our blood testing segment recognized product sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
procleix system on february   the us food and drug administration approved the procleix hiv hcv assay 
under a collaboration agreement with gen probe incorporated  we market and sell the procleix hiv hcv assay and the related instrument system 
in addition to selling directly in the us  we also sell in various european and asia pacific markets  directly and through distributors 
we record revenue based upon the reported results obtained from the customer from the use of assays to screen donations or upon sale and delivery of the assays  depending on the underlying contract 
in the case of equipment sales or leases  we record revenue upon the sale and transfer of the title to the instrument or ratably over the life of the lease term  respectively 
for the provision of service on the instruments  we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the service agreement 
worldwide product sales related to tests  instruments and the provision of services were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in product sales in as compared with primarily related to commercial pricing in the us commencing may  for the procleix hiv hcv assay following the us food and drug administration approval in february in addition  after the first quarter  we signed new commercial contracts including those with existing america s blood centers customers  the american red cross  the us military and the association of independent blood centers to provide the procleix hiv hcv assay 
other factors contributing to the increase in were i the introduction of the west nile virus assay on an investigational use basis in the us and ii market share gains in the us and increased sales to several markets abroad for the procleix hiv hcv assay 
slightly offsetting the increase in product sales related to tests  instruments and the provision of services in as compared with  was additional revenue recognized in the first quarter under contracts with all our us customers for increased donations exceeding contractual minimums 
the increase in product sales in as compared with related primarily to the commercial sale of the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us following the us food and drug administration approval in february during  we signed new commercial contracts including those with existing america s blood centers customers  the american red cross  the us military and the association of independent blood centers to provide the procleix hiv hcv assay 
in addition  in  we experienced continued expansion in several markets outside the us in the first and second quarters of  we recognized additional revenue under previously existing contracts with all our us customers for increased donations exceeding contractual minimums 
ortho clinical diagnostics under our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits for immunodiagnostic products 
we recognized product sales under this arrangement of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared with primarily related to an increase in products manufactured for ortho clinical diagnostics 
in addition  the timing of manufacturing services under the arrangement contributed to the increase in as compared with we also supply bulk antigens for ortho clinical diagnostics to be included in products to be sold by bayer under a june agreement with ortho clinical diagnostics and bayer corporation see also royalty and license fee revenues bayer below 
the increase in as compared with primarily related to the timing of manufacturing services rendered by chiron 
we expect competitive pressures related to our blood testing products to continue  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item business competition above 
revenues from joint business contractual arrangement revenues from our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared with primarily resulted from i a one time benefit in the first quarter due to a change in estimate relating to revenues from ortho clinical diagnostics non us affiliate sales  ii the timing of ortho clinical diagnostics shipments to third parties and iii increased profitability of ortho clinical diagnostics foreign affiliates 
offsetting the increase were lower profits from ortho clinical diagnostics us operations 
prior to the first quarter  we had accounted for revenues relating to ortho clinical diagnostics non us affiliate sales on a one quarter lag 
more current information is now available to us and as such  we now recognize revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one month lag  consistent with the method of how we recognize revenues relating to ortho clinical diagnostics sales for the us portion of ortho clinical diagnostics operations 
the increase in as compared with primarily was due to the timing of ortho s shipments to third parties  increased profitability of ortho clinical diagnostics foreign affiliates  expanding sales of assays used on ortho s vitros eci immunodiagnostic system and nominal price increases in the us collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
under the ortho clinical diagnostics  inc joint business arrangement  we conduct research and development services related to immunodiagnostic products 
our blood testing segment recognized total collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the majority of collaborative agreement revenues recognized by our blood testing segment related to immunodiagnostic products 
the fluctuations between and  and and  primarily were due to the timing of research services 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount and timing of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
royalty and license fee revenues our blood testing segment earns royalties from third parties based on their sales of immunodiagnostic and nucleic acid testing probe diagnostic products utilizing our hepatitis c virus and hiv related patents  for use in the blood screening and plasma fractionation markets 
our blood testing segment also earns license fees related to our hepatitis c virus and hiv related patents for technologies used by third parties to develop products for use in the blood screening and plasma fractionation markets 
the blood testing segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
baxter ag in june  we entered into two license agreements with baxter ag related to our hepatitis c virus and hiv technology for use in the plasma fractionation market for which we recognized a license fee in the second quarter in addition  we recognized royalty revenues under one of these agreements 
f 
hoffmann laroche settlement in october  we entered into three license agreements with f 
hoffmann laroche limited and several of its affiliated companies related to the settlement of certain litigation in the us and certain other countries for the use of our hepatitis c virus and hiv intellectual property 
two agreements relate to in vitro diagnostic products 
see other royalty and license fee revenues below 
the third agreement for blood screening was superseded in may by two new agreements  one for each of hepatitis c virus and hiv 
revenues under these agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared with related to i a million one time payment estimated using an alternative methodology under an agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche relating to back royalties  ii a contractual increase in the royalty rates and iii increased donations 
under these new agreements  royalties continue through the lives of the hepatitis c virus and hiv related patents covering f 
hoffmann la roche s nucleic acid testing products 
currently  the applicable issued hepatitis c virus related patents begin to expire in for the us and in for europe 
currently  the applicable issued hiv related patent in europe expires in an hiv related patent was issued in the us on march  this patent will expire seventeen years from the date of issuance 
as permitted under the terms of its licensing agreement  f 
hoffmann la roche has decided to institute arbitration proceedings in regard to the application of the us patent 
during any pending arbitration proceedings  f 
hoffmann la roche remains obligated to make all quarterly royalty payments  subject to a right to be reimbursed by us if it is determined in the arbitration that such royalty payments were not due 
the increase in as compared with related to i a contractual increase in the royalty rates  ii increased testing volume and iii positive adjustments of the estimate to actual testing in subsequent periods 
bayer in june  chiron and ortho clinical diagnostics  inc entered into an agreement with bayer corporation for the clinical diagnostic market 
under this agreement  bayer manufactures and sells certain of ortho clinical diagnostics hepatitis c virus and hiv immunodiagnostic products for use on bayer s instrument platforms 
bayer paid us a license fee of million  which we deferred due to our continuing manufacturing obligations and began recognizing as revenue in the third quarter we will recognize the remaining amount ratably through royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
gross profit blood testing gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in blood testing gross profit in as compared to related to the increase in nucleic acid testing product sales as a percentage of total blood testing product sales 
in november  chiron and gen probe incorporated agreed to amend their world wide blood screening collaboration agreement in order to adopt permanent  fixed revenue shares for each party 
effective january   gen probe s share will be set at of net revenues for assays  which include a test for the hepatitis c virus 
for commercial assays  which do not test for the hepatitis c virus  such as the prospective west nile test  the agreement remains unchanged with each party retaining of the net revenues after deduction of appropriate expenses 
blood testing gross profit percentages may fluctuate in future periods as the blood testing product and customer mix changes 
research and development our blood testing segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with is primarily related to i purchased in process technology associated with our investment in zymequest inc we are collaborating with zymequest  inc 
to develop and commercialize a enzymatic conversion system which converts group a  b and ab red blood cells to enzyme converted group o eco red blood cells  and ii costs associated with an agreement with infectio diagnostics inc in which we licensed proprietary nucleic acid based technology for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelets and blood products 
the remaining increase in costs is due to the continued development of nucleic acid testing products 
the increase in research and development spending in compared with primarily was due to the continued development of nucleic acid testing products and the timing of activities under the ortho clinical diagnostics joint business arrangement 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative our blood testing segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with related to the expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us  europe and other international markets and the preparation and roll out of the west nile virus assay under ind testing 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with related to the expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us  europe and other international markets we expect continued growth in selling  general and administrative expenses related to nucleic acid testing technology and products as our sales opportunities expand in new markets through anticipated additional nucleic acid testing adoption 
vaccines product sales we sell flu  meningococcal  travel  pediatric and other vaccines in the us  germany  italy  the united kingdom and other international markets 
vaccine product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales of our flu vaccines were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
flu vaccines sales increased in as compared with  primarily as a result of additional sales of flu vaccine products following our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
powderject pharmaceuticals flu vaccine sales were million in excluding powderject pharmaceuticals  sales of our remaining flu vaccines increased primarily as a result of the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate and price and volume increases in germany and italy 
the increase in flu vaccine sales in as compared with resulted from being first to the market in germany  increased sales to new countries  such as china  increased sales to existing countries due to increased awareness in the overall influenza vaccines market and improved production yields 
menjugate  our conjugate vaccine against meningococcal infection caused by the bacterium n 
meningitidis serogroup c  sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in menjugate sales in as compared with primarily related to the tender sales to australia and the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
in there were  as expected  fewer shipments to existing markets than in as a result of a universal vaccination program that occurred in the province of quebec  partially offset by shipments to new markets 
sales of our travel vaccines  comprised of tick borne encephalitis  rabies vaccines and two products we obtained as part of our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals  arilvax and dukoral were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in travel vaccines sales in as compared with primarily resulted from i increased fourth quarter sale of tick borne encephalitis for vaccines that are typically sold in the first half of the year  ii additional sales of travel vaccine products following our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals and iii the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
the increase in travel vaccine sales in as compared with primarily resulted from increased tick borne encephalitis vaccine sales with the launch of a new adult formulation and a pediatric formulation in germany 
sales of our pediatric and other vaccines were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in pediatric and other vaccines sales in as compared with was primarily due to i additional sales of other vaccine products following our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals  ii the timing of tender sales for measles  mumps and rubella vaccines and diphtheria  tetanus and pertussis vaccines and iii the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
contributing to the increase in pediatric and other vaccines sales as compared with were increased polio vaccine sales to non profit organizations and developing markets such as india 
certain of our vaccine products  particularly our flu vaccines  are seasonal and typically have higher sales in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
in addition  we expect menjugate sales to continue to fluctuate as public health authorities consider adoption of broad vaccination programs 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our vaccine products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  including  but not limited to  new combination vaccines  as listed in part i  item  business competition above 
collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our vaccines segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the first quarter  we entered into an agreement to supply a vaccine for meningococcal meningitis caused by the bacterium n

we recognized million of revenue under this arrangement in in addition  as a result of our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals  we recognized revenue under an agreement with medimmune  inc the balance of collaborative agreement revenues recognized in our vaccines segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount and timing of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  the collaboration agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the collaborative partners commercialize a product using our technology 
also  our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
royalty and license fee revenues our vaccines segment earns royalties on third party sales of  and license fees on  several products 
the vaccines segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
glaxosmithkline an agreement with glaxosmithkline plc provides for royalties on sales of certain vaccine products 
under this agreement  we recognized million  million and million of such royalties in  and  respectively 
other in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of royalty revenues primarily on third party sales of hepatitis b virus vaccine products 
the decrease in as compared with primarily related to i a decrease in sales of hepatitis b virus vaccine products due to competitive multivalent hepatitis b virus vaccine products and ii reduced royalties starting in the fourth quarter due to certain terms of one of the hepatitis b virus arrangements expiring in the third quarter certain patents related to the production of hepatitis b vaccine products expire beginning in  which will result in reductions in royalty revenues recognized under one arrangement 
royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
other revenues our vaccines segment recognized other revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
grant and contract revenues our vaccines segment other revenues included grant and contract revenues of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in the second quarter  we entered into an agreement with the us national institutes of health to advance our hiv vaccine program into human clinical trials 
under this arrangement  we could receive million over five years 
under supplemental arrangements  we may perform other work related to the national institutes of health s hiv vaccine program on a grant or contract by contract basis 
a majority of the grant and contract revenues  million  million and million in  and  respectively  were recognized under these arrangements 
contract manufacturing revenues included in our vaccines segment other revenues are contract manufacturing revenues of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations resulted from a change in the level of contract manufacturing activities 
the balance of other revenues recognized in our vaccines segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material 
other revenues recognized in our vaccines segment may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
gross profit vaccines gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit in as compared with related to additional costs of million in associated with the sale of inventory acquired during the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
these additional costs related to a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
excluding these additional costs  vaccine gross profit as a percentage of net product sales for would have been 
in addition  the vaccine gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by the shutdown of certain facilities  in the first quarter  to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
the decrease in vaccine gross profit margin in as compared with primarily related to i increased product reserves in due to various issues  including seasonality patterns  excess and obsolete inventory and production yields  ii lower sales of menjugate vaccine  which has a relatively high gross profit margin and iii the commencement  in the fourth quarter  of royalty payments to novartis ag based on menjugate sales under the december limited liability company agreement see note  related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
vaccines gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods due to product and customer mix  seasonality and ordering patterns and production yields 
research and development our vaccines segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending in compared with resulted mainly from the advancement of several programs in our meningococcal franchise and flu cell culture 
also  there was million of incremental research and development expense following our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
we have recently completed a phase iii trial in the us for menjugate vaccine 
we are currently compiling the data from this trial and anticipate filing a bla for menjugate in the study was conducted in conjunction with the northern california kaiser permanente vaccines research center  and will expand the vaccine s safety database for a us population relative to the safety profile of the current us licensed meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine menomune a  c  y  w 
the increase in research and development spending in compared with primarily was due to progress in the development of our meningococcal franchise and work related to the hiv vaccine program  partially funded by the us national institutes of health 
in april  chiron  rhein biotech nv now a part of berna biotech and greencross vaccine corporation entered into a collaboration agreement to research and develop certain pediatric combination vaccine products for sale outside of europe and north america 
under the collaboration agreement  we have commitments for a portion of the research and development expenses  which actually began in the first quarter  with berna biotech and greencross vaccine corporation 
the collaboration agreement also requires capital commitments from chiron  berna biotech and greencross vaccine corporation see liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash below 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative our vaccines segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with primarily relates to additional expenses following our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals 
excluding million of additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with powderject pharmaceuticals  including integration costs of million  the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from additional costs associated with the enhancement of current business processes and headcount and the euro to us dollar exchange rate fluctuation 
these increases were partially offset by i a payment made in the first quarter to the german government in lieu of statutory price reductions on prescription drugs that are reimbursed under the german government s healthcare program that was expensed in the first quarter and ii increased sales and marketing costs associated with the launch of our newly formulated tick borne encephalitis vaccine 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with related to i a payment made in the first quarter to the german government as discussed above  ii increased sales and marketing costs associated with the launch of our newly formulated tick borne encephalitis vaccine and increased flu vaccine sales and iii additional costs associated with the enhancement of current business processes and headcount 
these increases were partially offset by the reduced commissions paid under a co marketing and co promotion agreement with aventis pasteur msd related to sales of menjugate vaccine 
amortization expense our vaccines segment recognized amortization expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense in as compared with relates to the intangibles acquired following our acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals in the third quarter acquired intangible assets included the fair value of distribution rights  a contract manufacturing agreement and developed product technologies 
the distribution rights and the contract manufacturing agreement are being amortized on a straight line basis over to years 
developed product technologies are being amortized using either the estimated sales method over years or on a straight line basis over to years 
in the second quarter  we acquired the remaining interest in chiron behring from hoechst ag and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
acquired intangible assets included the fair value of trademarks  patents and customer lists  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over to years 
acquired intangible assets also included the assembled workforce 
on january   the assembled workforce was reclassified to goodwill and goodwill was no longer amortized 
this change was the primary reason for the decrease in amortization expense in as compared with as circumstances dictate  we will evaluate the useful life and carrying value of each intangible asset  which may result in future adjustments to the amortization periods or book values 
the goodwill and assembled workforce amortization expense was million in biopharmaceuticals product sales biopharmaceutical product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
biopharmaceutical product sales in  and consisted principally of betaseron interferon beta b  tobi tobramycin and proleukin aldesleukin 
betaseron interferon beta b we manufacture interferon beta b which is marketed by schering ag and its affiliates  including berlex laboratories  inc collectively schering  under the trade names betaseron in the u 
s and other non european markets and betaferon in europe 
boehringer ingelheim also supplies betaferon to schering for sale in europe 
for product manufactured by us  we recognize a portion of revenue for product sales upon shipment to schering and the remainder based on a contractual percentage of sales by schering  both of which we record as product sales 
for product manufactured by boehringer ingelheim and marketed by schering in europe under the trade name betaferon  we receive royalties calculated at the same percentage of sales less supply costs  which we record in royalty and license fee revenues 
starting in the fourth quarter  the amount we recorded as product sales  based on a percentage of sales by schering  and betaferon royalties  declined by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering 
as a result  we estimate that the percentage of sales per unit on which our payments are based will decrease  reducing our per unit revenue by approximately for sales of chiron product and approximately for royalties from sales of boehringer ingelheim product from that received prior to the decline 
however  there are a number of mitigating considerations  including i the transitional supply agreement  discussed in royalty and license fee revenues betaferon below  ii the volume mix of chiron product and boehringer ingelheim product and iii the launch of product upgrades with ease of use features 
we believe these considerations will partially offset this contractual change 
in october  the us food and drug administration approved a new pre filled diluent syringe for betaseron 
the pre filled diluent syringe was launched in january and enhances the delivery mode and shortens preparation  helping to simplify injections of betaseron 
in the first quarter  the us food and drug administration approved new labeling for betaseron 
the labeling expands the indication for betaseron to treat all relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis include relapsing remitting  the most common form  and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses 
pursuant to our agreement with schering  we began supplying betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets  which were previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  and a decrease in royalty revenues beginning in the fourth quarter in  schering extended its supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim through the exact shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity  schering s minimum purchase commitment under the extended supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim  and market demand 
the shift to product sales is expected to increase over the next three years 
we expect overall  biopharmaceutical earnings to be largely unaffected by the transition 
in order to supply betaferon to schering  we are required to make capital improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities to increase capacity 
during and  we recorded charges related to process development and test runs associated with this project 
see research and development below 
betaseron product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in betaseron product sales in as compared with  primarily related to i price increases  ii the benefit of the movement in foreign exchange rates and iii increased patient demand attributed to an overall increase in the market for interferon beta b products for multiple sclerosis 
these increases were partially offset by i a decline in the amount we recorded as product sales  based on a percentage of sales by schering  by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering  ii fluctuations in wholesaler ordering patterns  and iii incremental revenues recognized in the first quarter related to the effect of recording revenue based on more current information available from schering 
in  schering converted to wholesaler distribution from direct distribution method 
prior to the first quarter  we accounted for revenues from non us product sales based on information provided by schering on a one quarter lag 
more current information of non us betaseron sales became available in  and as a result  we were able to begin recognizing revenues from betaseron product sales on a current basis 
this change resulted in incremental revenues recognized during the first quarter of million 
inventory ordering patterns as well as foreign currency exchange rates may influence future betaseron sales 
the increases in betaseron product sales in as compared with  primarily related to i increased underlying patient demand from end users in the us and certain international markets  ii price increases and iii fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels  following the conversion to wholesaler distribution in as discussed above  prior to  we accounted for non us product sales based on information provided by schering on a one quarter lag 
more current information of non us betaseron sales was available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize betaseron product sales on a current basis 
as a result  there were incremental product sales revenues recognized during the first quarter of million 
as discussed in royalties and license fee revenues below  betaferon royalties also increased in as compared with  and in as compared with tobi tobramycin we sell tobi directly in the us and certain international markets 
we recognized tobi sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
increased tobi sales in as compared with  primarily related to i greater product penetration in various european countries  ii price increases  iii the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate and iv increased use and improved compliance in the us by patients with cystic fibrosis 
these increases were partially offset by a change in sales adjustments 
increased tobi sales in as compared with primarily related to i the progress of the tobi product launch in various european countries  ii increased use and compliance in the us by patients with cystic fibrosis and iii price increases 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro  have also contributed slightly to the increase in tobi sales 
in  these increases were partially offset by an increased level of medicaid rebates 
we continue to pursue the use of tobi to treat other serious lung infections and to seek approval in other countries 
wholesaler ordering patterns as well as reimbursement and government pressures  competition  foreign currency exchange rates and the level of rebates may influence future tobi sales 
in december  the us food and drug administration tentatively approved an abbreviated new drug application for an inhaled tobramycin for sale in the us following expiration of the orphan drug status of tobi in december subsequently  the application was withdrawn and under terms of a settlement agreement reached in october  approval will not be sought to market this generic product until the expiration of our patent in the us covering the formulation of tobi 
proleukin aldesleukin proleukin is approved in over countries for the treatment of metastatic stage iv renal cell carcinoma and in canada and the us for the treatment of metastatic stage iv melanoma 
sales of proleukin were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in proleukin product sales in as compared with primarily related to i price increases  ii increase in patient demand in the us and iii the benefit of the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
these increases were partially offset by wholesaler ordering patterns and a decrease in underlying patient demand in europe 
proleukin product sales in as compared with increased primarily as a result of stabilization of wholesale ordering patterns  from those experienced in  relative to demand and price increases 
in  wholesalers significantly reduced inventories from quantities held at the end of in  wholesalers decreased inventories only slightly 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro  have also contributed slightly to the increase in proleukin sales 
wholesale ordering patterns  reimbursement pressures and foreign currency exchange rates may influence future proleukin sales 
the balance of product sales recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other products  which individually were not material 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our biopharmaceutical products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item  business competition above 
collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
s bio in the second quarter  we invested in a singapore based venture  s bio pte ltd  to research and develop therapeutic  diagnostic  vaccine and antibody products 
we also granted s bio certain rights to our gene expression and combinatorial chemistry technology 
under this arrangement  we received approximately million for technology transfer and research services 
we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million and million in and  respectively  under this arrangement 
the technology transfer period and the related revenue recognition period ended in the third quarter glaxosmithkline plc in the fourth quarter  we entered into a collaboration agreement and license agreement with glaxosmithkline plc related to certain of our mc r compound patents 
under this arrangement  we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million for novartis in  chiron and novartis entered into an agreement which provided  among other things  for certain cross licenses between chiron and novartis  and under which novartis paid us million over five years 
in connection with this agreement  we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million in this agreement expired in the fourth quarter our other segment also earned collaborative agreement revenues under a third novartis agreement 
see other collaborative agreement revenues below 
the balance of collaborative agreement revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount and timing of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and our achievement of performance milestones

in addition  the collaboration agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the collaborative partners commercialize a product using our technology 
also  our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
royalty and license fee revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment earns royalties on third party sales of several products  including betaferon interferon beta b and recombinant insulin and glucagon products 
our biopharmaceuticals segment also earns license fees for technologies  such as hepatitis c virus patents  used by third parties to develop therapeutic products 
the biopharmaceuticals segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
betaferon interferon beta b we manufacture interferon beta b which is marketed by schering ag and its affiliates  including berlex laboratories  inc collectively schering  under the trade names betaseron in the u 
s and other non european markets and betaferon in europe 
boehringer ingelheim also supplies betaferon to schering for sale in europe 
for product manufactured by boehringer ingelheim  we receive royalties calculated as a percentage of sales less the amount paid or incurred by schering for supply costs  including schering s cost to purchase product from boehringer ingelheim 
in  and  we recognized betaferon royalties of million  million and million  respectively  under this arrangement 
the increase in betaferon royalties in compared with was due to i benefit in the movement of the euro to us dollar exchange rate  ii the benefit of a reduction of the allocated cost under a three year limited cost sharing arrangement under the transitional supply agreement with schering  iii increase in demand and iv a positive impact of the difference between the adjustment of estimated royalty to actual royalty 
these increases were partially offset by i a decline in our royalty rate in the fourth quarter by five percentage points  pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering  ii incremental revenues recognized during the first quarter of million related to a change in our methodology of recognizing these royalties and iii a shift in revenue from royalty revenue to product sales 
prior to  we accounted for betaferon royalties as a percentage of forecast received from schering  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of european betaseron sales was available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize betaferon royalties on a current basis beginning in the first quarter the increase in betaferon royalties in compared with was due to i increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis  ii fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally the euro and iii incremental revenues recognized during the first quarter of million related to a change in our methodology of recognizing these royalties as discussed above 
these increases were offset partially by the shift of revenue from royalties to product sales related to switzerland as schering began to sell product purchased in into the market 
as discussed in product sales betaseron above  we began supplying betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets  which was previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  with a decrease in royalty revenues  beginning in the fourth quarter in  schering extended its supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim through the exact shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity  schering s minimum purchase commitment under the extended supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim and market demand 
the shift to product sales is expected to increase over the next three years 
we expect overall biopharmaceutical earnings to be largely unaffected by the transition 
future betaferon royalties will be influenced by demand  price changes  decline in our royalty rate and foreign currency exchange rates 
novo nordisk we earn royalty revenues on insulin and glucagon product sales by novo nordisk as 
we recognized million  million and million in  and  respectively  under this arrangement 
patents related to the production of insulin and glucagons began expiring in late and as a result  significant reductions in royalty revenue recognized under this arrangement in future periods are expected

results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
also  the license agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the licensees commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the licensees will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
other revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized other revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized contract manufacturing revenues of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in as compared to  and in as compared to  resulted from the level of activity and the timing of contract manufacturing activities 
biogen and serono settlements a us court of appeals partially reversed a district court ruling in connection with certain patents owned by chiron and licensed exclusively to schering ag s us subsidiary  berlex laboratories 
as a result of the ruling and prior agreements between biogen and berlex  biogen was required to make a settlement payment to schering 
in accordance with an earlier contract between chiron and berlex  we recognized approximately million in  which represented our share of this settlement payment 
in addition  there was a similar settlement between berlex and serono of which we recognized approximately million in the balance of other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material

in connection with this project  we are continuing to incur expenses relating to the development of new processes and the performance of test runs related to the installed equipment 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the activities for various clinical trials  including i transfer of the responsibility of the silcaat trial to niaid and the university of minnesota in the fourth quarter  discussed below  and ii termination of our development activities for hbv mf  an immunotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis b infection and pa  a compound for gram negative infections in cystic fibrosis patients 
in april  we acquired exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights from novartis for aerosolized cyclosporine acsa  a therapy under evaluation for treatment of rejection and reduction of mortality in lung transplant recipients 
in october  we entered into a license agreement with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc for the development and commercialization of cubist s antibiotic daptomycin for injection in western and eastern europe  australia  new zealand  india and certain central american  south american and middle eastern countries 
in exchange for these development and commercialization rights  we have agreed to pay cubist up to million 
this million includes million  which was paid by chiron up front in the fourth quarter  million of which was used to purchase restricted cubist common stock at a percent premium over market price and up to million of additional payments to cubist upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones 
we will also pay cubist a tiered royalty on daptomycin for injection made by chiron

purchased technologies  which were concluded to have alternative future uses  represented the fair value of research and development projects  which we will develop further after the acquisition date 
we are amortizing purchased technologies on a straight line basis over years 
acquired intangible assets included the fair value of trademarks and trade names  patents and databases  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over to years 
on january   assembled workforce was reclassified to goodwill and goodwill ceased to be amortized 
this change was the primary reason for the decrease in amortization expense in as compared with as circumstances dictate  we evaluate the useful life and value of each intangible asset  which may result in future adjustments to the amortization periods or carrying values 
goodwill including assembled workforce amortization expense was million in other collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our other segment did not recognize collaborative agreement revenues in and our other segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million in under an agreement with novartis ag

currently  the applicable issued hepatitis c virus related patents expire in for the us and in for europe 
currently  the applicable issued hiv related patent in europe expires in an hiv related patent directed to nucleic acid testing methods for hiv was issued in the us on march  this patent will expire seventeen years from the date of issuance 
the issuance of the patent triggered a milestone payment to chiron of million from f 
hoffmann la roche  which was received in april as permitted under the terms of its licensing agreement  f 
hoffmann la roche has decided to institute arbitration proceedings in regard to the application of the us patent 
we have deferred recognition of this million milestone payment and interest as of december  during any pending arbitration proceedings  f 
hoffmann la roche remains obligated to make all quarterly royalty payments  subject to a right to be reimbursed by chiron if it is determined in the arbitration that such royalty payments were not due 
see blood testing royalties and license fee revenues above for a discussion of the third agreement entered into with f 
hoffmann laroche in october and two additional agreements entered into with f 
hoffmann laroche in may  which superseded the october agreement 
bayer in connection with the sale of chiron diagnostics to bayer corporation  we granted bayer rights under hiv and hepatitis c virus related patents for use in nucleic acid diagnostic tests excluding blood screening 
in exchange for these rights  bayer paid us a license fee of million  which became nonrefundable in decreasing amounts over a period of three years  commencing in we recognized license fee revenues in  which represented the portion of the million payment that became nonrefundable during that period 
we recognized the final portion of revenue in the fourth quarter in addition  the cross license agreement provides for royalties to us on hiv and hepatitis c virus products sold by bayer  which increased in compared with primarily due to increased donations and a contractual increase in the royalty rates 
f 
hoffmann laroche pcr agreement under a july agreement between f 
hoffmann laroche limited and cetus corporation a company acquired by chiron  we received royalties on sales of polymerase chain reaction products and services sold by f 
hoffmann laroche and its licensees 
we did not recognize any revenue under this agreement in in and we recognized million and million  respectively  under this agreement 
f 
hoffmann laroche s royalty obligations  with certain limited exceptions for future products  expired in the fourth quarter we recorded the adjustment of the estimate to actual for the final fourth quarter royalties in the first quarter the amount recognized in is a back royalty relating to that resulted from a royalty audit conducted in the balance of royalty and license fee revenues for  and consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
other revenues our other segment recognized other revenues of million in relating to matrix pharmaceutical contract manufacturing projects that were not completed at the time of the acquisition 
selling  general and administrative in  and  our other segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with primarily resulted from integration costs of million incurred by the other segment associated with our third quarter acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals  an impairment charge associated with long lived assets  employee related expenses  severance costs  additional consulting costs and a charitable donation to the chiron foundation 
these increases were partially offset by lower litigation costs in related to our investment in and defense of our patents and technology 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was due to our continued investment in and defense of our patents and technology partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses

we assumed revenue from tezacitabine to commence after as with all pharmaceutical products  the probability of commercial success for any research and development project is highly uncertain 
interest expense in  and  we incurred interest expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in as compared with primarily related to interest expense recognized on the million convertible debentures that were issued on july  the increase in interest expense in as compared with was primarily due to the interest expense recognized on the liquid yield option notes that were issued in june interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  primarily consisted of interest income on our cash and investment balances and other non operating gains and losses 
in  and  we recognized interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in as compared with primarily was due to lower average cash and investment balances following the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals and lower average interest rates 
the decrease in interest income in as compared with was primarily due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances following the million received upon issuance of the liquid yield option notes in june in  and  we recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively  related to the sale of certain equity securities 
there were no losses attributable to impairment of equity securities in in and  we recognized losses attributable to the impairment of certain debt and equity securities of million and million  respectively

the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition 
the effective tax rates for and after excluding the impact of the in process research and development charges were and 
the effective tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate due to increased benefits associated with our research and development activities and an increase in income earned in lower tax jurisdictions 
the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  which reflects the amortization of goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets related to the pathogenesis corporation acquisition 
the reported effective tax rate is slightly higher than the reported effective tax rate due to the charge for non deductible in process research and development in  which outweighed the increased benefits realized in from foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us tax rate and the absence of non deductible goodwill amortization in the effective tax rate may be affected in future period by changes in management s estimates with respect to our deferred tax assets  by the impact of acquisitions and new tax legislation  or by other items 
management believes the acquisition of powderject pharmaceuticals may cause an increase in the future effective tax rate and is in the process of evaluating certain options that may mitigate any potential increase 
specifically  most of powderject pharmaceutical s profits earned are in the united kingdom  subject to a marginal tax rate 
discontinued operations in a strategic effort to focus on our core businesses of blood testing  vaccines and biopharmaceuticals  we completed the sale of chiron diagnostics and chiron vision in and  respectively

 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations

the holders of the lyons may require us to purchase all  or a portion of  their lyons on june  at a purchase price of per lyon 
the accreted value on june  will be million 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of chiron common stock or any combination thereof 
given our ability to pay the purchase price in shares of chiron common stock  we continue to classify the lyons as long term liabilities as of december  additional alternatives open to us to satisfy requests to purchase the lyons include issuing new debt or equity securities 
the next dates on which the holders may require us to purchase the lyons following june  are june   and every fifth year thereafter until maturity in we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  together with funds provided by operations and leasing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable operating cash requirements over at least the next twelve months including any cash utilized under our stock repurchase program  the potential purchase of all  or a portion  of the lyons and our contractual obligations of million in the next twelve months as discussed in the contractual obligations table below

operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to i higher income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges  which increased mainly due to flu vaccine sales following the acquisition of powderject and higher product sales of procleix system  partially offset by increases in research and development costs 
increases in research and development costs were primarily due to the development of a dry powder formulation of our inhaled tobi tobramycin product  the development of tezacitabine  the development of interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies  expansion of our meningococcal franchise and development of flu cell culture

as a result  our italian subsidiary made significant tax payments in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were offset partially by a million license fee payment received from bayer corporation in june  as discussed in blood testing royalty and license fee revenues above 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures in will primarily be driven by i those activities under our december and june collaboration agreements with nektar therapeutics formerly inhale therapeutic systems  inc related to  among other things  the development of a dry powder formulation of our inhaled tobi product for the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients  ii those activities related to the development of interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies  iii expansion of our meningococcal franchise  iv development of flu cell culture  v research activities focused on identifying several novel vaccines and therapeutics for clinical development in the areas of oncology and infectious disease and vi those activities related to development with tifacogin in severe community acquired pneumonia

at the inception of the lease  the future minimum lease payments  exclusive of a residual value guarantee  are approximately million over the lease term 
the interest payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to a three month london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
the lease provides a million residual value guarantee from us to the lessors in the event of property value declines 
consequently  our maximum payment obligation is million upon termination of the lease on or before july  on or before july   we can choose to either purchase the facility from the lessors or sell the facility to a third party 
this option accelerates if we default on our lease payments or in the event of other defined events 
as of july   novartis ag had guaranteed under provisions of the investment agreement payments on this lease commitment  including payment of the residual value guarantee  to a maximum of million 
other non current liabilities as recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we lease laboratory  office and manufacturing facilities  land and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through effective august   chiron and ibm corporation amended and restated the previous ten year information technology services agreement which was effective on july  under this revised agreement  ibm agreed to provide us with a full range of information services until march  we can terminate this agreement at any time beginning april   subject to certain termination charges 
if we do not terminate this agreement  future payments to ibm are expected to be approximately million 
payments to ibm are subject to adjustment depending upon the levels of services and infrastructure equipment provided by ibm  as well as inflation

there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december  and december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt arrangements 
market risk management our cash flow from operations and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  the fair value of equity securities held and the realized value of investment securities sold 
we attempt to limit our exposure to some or all of these market risks through the use of various financial instruments 
these activities are discussed in further detail in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
factors that may affect future results as a global pharmaceutical company  we are engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this k and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by us from time to time reflect our current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond our control  which could cause actual results to differ 
if our focus on the research and development of emerging technologies does not result in the creation of commercial products  our business could be harmed 
we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of these programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it lacks the intended therapeutic or prophylactic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects  which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
further  success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment  adversely affecting short term profitability  to bring such products to market 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
conflicts with or decisions by third parties we collaborate with could harm our business 
an important part of our business strategy depends upon collaborations with third parties  including research collaborations and joint efforts to develop and commercialize new products 
as circumstances change  chiron and our strategic partners may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
we may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  we may disagree with our strategic partners as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the strategic partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect our strategic partners  causing them to reprioritize their efforts related to the research collaborations and other joint efforts with us 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact our profitability 
if we fail to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals we need to market our products  our business will suffer 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of our products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis 
in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
product candidates that appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
in addition  regulations may be amended from time to time 
revised regulations may require us to reformulate products on a country or regional basis  obtain additional regulatory approvals  or accept additional risks that our products will not maintain market acceptance or be eligible for third party insurance coverage 
increased regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding marketing practices for products that are subject to government reimbursement may impact the sales of such products 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy these new regulatory requirements and may suffer a loss of revenue as a result 
our products are complex and difficult to manufacture on a large scale basis  which could cause us to delay product launches  experience shortages of products or prevent us from offering products on a volume basis 
most of our products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process  that is  to show that the process works and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process  including quality control  labeling and packaging  may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures or product recalls  or liability to a third party to the extent we are contract manufacturing products in our facilities for such third party 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products that require novel manufacturing processes 
additionally  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval  which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
for some of our products  we rely on others to supply raw materials and to manufacture those products according to regulatory requirements 
in addition  any prolonged interruption in our operations or those of our partners could result in our inability to satisfy the product demands of our customers 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including equipment malfunctions or failures  interruptions due to labor action  damage to a facility due to natural disasters  such as an earthquake  suspension of power supplied to these facilities arising out of regional power shortages or terrorist activities and armed conflict  including as a result of the disruption of operations of our subsidiaries and our customers  suppliers  distributors  couriers  collaborative partners  licensees and clinical trial sites 
our mishandling of hazardous materials could result in substantial costs and harm to our business 
in connection with our research and manufacturing activities  we utilize some hazardous materials 
we believe we take great care to ensure we have appropriate procedures and permits in place for storing and handling such hazardous materials 
we could be subject to loss of our permits  government fines or penalties and or other adverse governmental action if such hazardous materials are stored  handled or released into the environment in violation of law or any permit 
a substantial fine or penalty  the payment of significant environmental remediation costs or the loss of a permit or other authorization to operate or engage in our ordinary course of business could result in material  unanticipated expenses and the possible inability to satisfy customer demand 
if any of our third party suppliers or manufacturers cannot adequately meet our needs  our business could be harmed 
we use raw materials and other supplies that generally are available from multiple commercial sources 
certain manufacturing processes  however  use materials that are available from sole sources  or that are in short supply  or are difficult for the supplier to produce and certify in accordance with our specifications 
from time to time  concerns are raised with respect to potential contamination of biological materials that are supplied to us 
these concerns can further tighten market conditions for materials that may be in short supply or available from limited sources 
moreover  regulatory approvals to market our products may be conditioned upon obtaining certain materials from specified sources 
our ability to substitute material from an alternate source may be delayed pending regulatory approval of such alternate source 
although we work to mitigate the risks associated with relying on sole suppliers  there is a possibility that material shortages could impact production 
we purchase bulk powdered tobramycin  the primary basic raw material in tobi tobramycin  from two of the principal worldwide suppliers of the drug 
we anticipate that either one of these suppliers alone will be able to supply sufficient quantities to meet current needs  however  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet future demand in a timely and cost effective manner 
as a result  our operations could be adversely affected by an interruption or reduction in the supply of bulk powdered tobramycin 
we have entered into contracts with third parties for the production and packaging of tobi 
over time  we can use alternative production and packaging sources 
however  if the contracted third parties become unable to produce or package sufficient quantities of tobi due to work stoppages or other factors  our operations could be disrupted until alternative sources are secured 
in connection with the production of our flu vaccine products  we must purchase large quantities of chicken eggs 
currently  for fluvirin vaccine  we purchase those eggs and incubation services from a single supplier in the united kingdom and  pursuant to the contract with that supplier  we are required to make specified minimum purchases from that supplier through if our supplier were to fail to supply eggs in sufficient quantities or quality  including as a result of any health or other issues related to the chickens  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics 
in nucleic acid testing  we rely on our collaborative partner  gen probe  to manufacture the west nile virus assay  currently in use on an investigational use basis in the us and the procleix hiv hcv assay 
we currently source the related instrument system from third party suppliers 
currently  gen probe is the only manufacturer of nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology 
in immunodiagnostics  under the ortho clinical diagnostics  inc contract  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits sold in the clinical diagnostics and blood screening fields 
while we and our partners work to mitigate the risks associated with being a key provider  there can be no assurance that our partner  gen probe  will be able to provide sufficient quantities of the procleix hiv hcv assay or that we will be able to manufacture sufficient bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits for immunodiagnostic products 
our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply  as well as increase costs and cause loss of revenue or market share 
if we cannot obtain necessary licenses to third party patents for the manufacture or sale of our products  we may have to withdraw from the market or delay the introduction of the affected product 
third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the us and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain products and products in development by us and our strategic partners 
it is likely that third parties will obtain these patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be broad enough to prevent or delay us and our strategic partners from manufacturing or marketing products important to our current and future business 
we cannot accurately predict the scope  validity and enforceability of these patents  if granted  the extent to which we may wish or need to obtain licenses to these patents  and the cost and availability of these licenses 
if we do not or cannot obtain these licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around these patents  or we could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
we could also incur substantial costs in licensing or challenging the validity and scope of these patents 
because most of our products are based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community  they may not be accepted by healthcare providers and patients  which could harm our business 
we may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
we have no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products 
in addition  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of our products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of our product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or a government entity withdrawing its recommendation to screen blood donations for certain viruses or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over our product 
if we are unable to avoid significant exposure to product liability claims  our business could be harmed 
we are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
while we will continue to take precautions  we may not avoid significant product liability exposure 
although we maintain product liability insurance  there is no guarantee that this coverage will be sufficient 
it is not feasible to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain products and we are self insured in relation to these products 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our products  we could suffer a significant financial loss 
as we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics  we may have product liability in addition to contract exposure  in the event that our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply 
if we are unable to successfully compete in the highly competitive healthcare industry  our business could be harmed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  and biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than us 
accordingly  even if we are successful in launching a product  we may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater access to certain raw materials  the competitor may have more efficient manufacturing processes  the competitor may adapt more quickly to technological change  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages  or new competitors may enter into markets where we currently have significant competitive advantage 
the technologies applied by our competitors and us are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
in addition  we may be impacted by competition from generic forms of our products or substitute products 
specific to one product  tobi  a generic form of this product may be available from our competitors  which may cause loss of revenue or market share 
in december  the us food and drug administration tentatively approved an abbreviated new drug application for an inhaled tobramycin for sale in the us following expiration of the orphan drug status of tobi in december subsequently  the application was withdrawn and under terms of a settlement agreement reached in october  approval will not be sought to market this generic product until the expiration of our patent in the us covering the formulation of tobi 
our patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues 
we seek to obtain patents on many of our inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use our inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by us and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate us for the use of the invention 
we have no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to us will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets 
we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will be granted  or the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the us and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor the enforceable scope of its claims 
we have engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of our patents and expect to continue to do so 
an adverse outcome of litigation could result in the reduction or loss of royalty revenues 
engaging in patent litigation against one party may place significant royalty revenues received or to be received from other parties at risk 
even if we are successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to resolve patent litigation successfully may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by our patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
in addition  royalty revenues may decline as patents expire 
sales of our products may be adversely affected by the availability and amount of reimbursement to the user of our products from third parties  such as the government and insurance companies 
in the us and other significant markets  sales of our products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
if the united states congress enacts legislative proposals addressing parallel importation currently being deliberated  revenues from certain products may be affected by this change in us policy 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
if our efforts to integrate acquired or licensed businesses or technologies into our business are not successful  our business could be harmed 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to continue to grow our business through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
for example  we are currently in the process of completing the integration of powderject pharmaceuticals 
the failure to adequately address the financial  operational or legal risks raised by such transactions  including our integration of powderject  could harm our business 
financial aspects related to these transactions may alter our financial position  reported operating results or stock price  and include use of cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  impairment losses or restructuring charges  large write offs and difficulties in assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets 
operational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from such transactions include challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business  difficulties in assimilating the operations  products  technology  information systems or personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company  including intellectual property claims  and subsequent loss of key personnel 
legal risks may include requirements to obtain the consent of our stockholders or a third party  or the approval of various regulatory authorities 
if such efforts to integrate acquired or licensed businesses or technologies into our business are not successful  our business could be harmed 
if we cannot initiate and maintain revenue generating relationships with third parties  we may not be able to grow our revenues in the near to medium term 
many products in our current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
our ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of our technologies  and on our ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
we may fail to establish such other sources of revenue 
fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and levels of indebtedness could harm our business 
we have significant cash balances and investments 
our financial results  therefore  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  we sell products in many countries throughout the world  and our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we have significant debt balances following the issuance of our most recent convertible debt offerings 
therefore  our financial results will reflect increased interest expense and we could be harmed by a negative change to our credit rating by the debt rating agencies 
the holders of the liquid yield option notes lyons due may require us to purchase all  or a portion  of the lyons on june  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or in shares of chiron common stock 
to the extent we elect to purchase the lyons for cash  our inability to replace the lyons with new debt securities could adversely affect our cash balances and our business 
to the extent we elect to pay for the lyons in shares of chiron common stock  the existing common stockholders would experience dilution as a result of the newly issued shares of chiron common stock 
our relationship with novartis ag could limit our ability to enter into transactions  pursue opportunities in conflict with novartis and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we have an alliance with novartis ag  a life sciences company headquartered in basel  switzerland 
under a series of agreements between chiron and novartis  and as a result of subsequent stock issuances by chiron  novartis ownership interest in chiron was approximately as of december  the governance agreement between chiron and novartis contains provisions that require the approval of novartis before we enter into certain corporate transactions 
these transactions generally include significant debt or equity issuances  debt or equity repurchases  most mergers and acquisitions  the payment of cash dividends  amendments to chiron s certificate of incorporation or by laws  and other transactions that would adversely impact the rights of novartis  or discriminate against novartis  as a chiron stockholder 
in addition  a majority of the independent directors must approve any material transactions between chiron and novartis 
these provisions may limit our ability to enter into transactions with third parties otherwise viewed as beneficial to chiron 
all of our shares owned by novartis are eligible for sale in the public market subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws 
we have agreed that  upon novartis request  we will file one or more registration statements under the securities act in order to permit novartis to offer and sell shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by novartis in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
volatility of our stock price could negatively impact our profitability 
the price of our stock  like that of other pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation fluctuations in earnings from period to period  results of clinical trials conducted by us or by our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with strategic partners  corporate restructuring by us  the sale of a substantial number of shares held by our existing stockholders  licensing activities by us  and the acquisition or sale by us of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with our research and development collaborations  from time to time we may invest in equity securities of our strategic partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect our stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
we are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions and changes to the corporate tax rate and laws of any of these jurisdictions could increase the amount of corporate taxes we have to pay 
we pay taxes principally in the us  germany  italy  the netherlands and  with the acquisition of powderject  the united kingdom 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws  which could increase our future tax provision 
we have negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes that are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  income taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while we believe that all material tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we are presently under audit in several jurisdictions and may be subject to further audits in the future  and we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  we have assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of our former subsidiaries  chiron vision subject to certain limitations and chiron diagnostics 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact our entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering our effective tax rate 
volatility of earnings could negatively impact our business 
our operating results may vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
any number of factors may affect our quarterly operating results 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following inventory management practices  including wholesale ordering patterns  the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities  seasonality of certain vaccine products  the tender driven nature of certain vaccine products  the nature of our collaborative  royalty and license arrangements and other revenue sources  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the level of product reserves due to various issues  including seasonality patterns  excess and obsolete inventory  and production yields 
our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year 
revisions to accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time  attention and resources  especially by senior management 
we must follow accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the us and other countries where we do business 
from time to time  these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws 
these new and revised accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws may require changes to our financial statements  the composition of our board of directors  the composition  the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees  the information filed by us with the governing bodies and enforcement of tax laws against us 
implementing changes required by such new standards  requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time  attention and resources  especially by our senior management 
it is impossible to predict the impact  if any  on chiron of future changes to accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws 
in addition  it is possible that the application of certain current accounting standards may change due to environmental factors  which may necessitate a change in our standard practice related to these accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in western european countries 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of those countries 
our primary exposures to foreign exchange rates are associated with the value of the euro and the value of the great british pound 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar vis vis the euro will result in a higher value of our non us dollar based revenues 
similarly  a decrease in the value of the us dollar vis vis the great british pound will result in a higher value of our pound denominated expenditures 
to manage foreign currency exchange risks  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase foreign currency option contracts 
we do not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional principal amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
at december   our exposures amounted to million and were offset by foreign currency forward contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the foreign currency forward contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a movement against our portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a gain or loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus our portfolio of transaction exposures has occurred only once in the last quarters in the second quarter of 
foreign currency gains from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we may selectively hedge anticipated currency exposures by purchasing foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts 
our primary anticipated exposures are related to foreign revenues and expenditures related to our western european operations 
to limit hedging costs  we generally purchase out of the money foreign currency option contracts 
at december   anticipated exposures associated with certain euro denominated revenues amounted to million and were partially offset by foreign currency option contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the foreign currency option contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a adverse movement against this portfolio of anticipated exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus this portfolio of anticipated exposures has occurred once in the last quarters  in the second quarter interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates in both our investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments where interest rates are tied to the london inter bank offered rate 
we have a diversified portfolio of financial instruments  including money market funds and instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our convertible debentures because the debentures bear interest at fixed rates 
our investment portfolio amounted to approximately  million at december  as of that date  we also had million of floating rate obligations tied to the london inter bank offered rate 
we have a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of our portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to the london inter bank offered rate 
the analysis below describes the impact of changes in interest rates to us and is based on a net investment portfolio of million 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to us over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income of million over the month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in reported income of million 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by changed in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
a larger than basis point movement in short term interest rates has occurred in two of the last ten years  a basis point movement has occurred in four of the last ten years  and a basis point movement has occurred in four of the last ten years 
equity securities risk we have exposure to equity price risk because of our investments in equity securities 
typically  we obtain these securities through our collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we classify a majority of these securities as available for sale and  consequently  record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
we periodically review the carrying values of these securities 
we recognize other than temporary losses against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
changes in share prices affect the value of our equity portfolio 
to reduce this risk  we hedged a portion of our exposure through forward sales contracts 
the forward sales contracts substantially offset the long position and  in effect  neutralize the impact of market valuation shifts on the hedged securities 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million versus a fair value of million 
a lower fair value indicates a gain on forward sales contracts since we sold the shares forward at higher prices 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
in the future  we may use additional hedging strategies in order to mitigate the potential adverse impact from changes in the market value of stock prices 
we have no assurance that other than temporary losses will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively  to write down certain available for sale equity securities for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
there was no such charge in at december   if the market price of our equity investments  including warrants  decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk we manage the risk of counterparty default on our debt securities and derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
we execute debt securities and derivative financial instruments with financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings  which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment or deterioration in credit rating 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down debt securities with a face value of million due to the decline in the credit rating of the issuer 
on march   the issuer paid us the full principal plus interest  thus offsetting the prior loss 
we have not experienced any permanent losses due to counterparty default
