table of contents contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed in item and elsewhere in this report 
overview agilent  incorporated in delaware in may  is a global diversified technology organization that provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
prior to our initial public offering of percent of our stock in november  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hewlett packard 
hewlett packard distributed the remaining percent of our stock to its stockholders on june  in the form of a stock dividend 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
reclassifications amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended october  and october  have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in executive summary the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor market  electronics industry  computer industry and telecommunications markets  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 
in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider  our revenue is dependent on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers  who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 
we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the foreseeable future 
given these spending patterns  we are moving towards a more variable cost structure in order to minimize any adverse impact to our profitability 
this includes the use of contract manufacturers and third party service providers 
we generate revenue directly from sales of components incorporated in consumer electronics  such as cell phones  cameras  games  personal computers  and printers  or indirectly from sales of test and measurement equipment used to design  manufacture or test such components 
sales of these components and test and measurement equipment are concentrated during the holiday season 
this seasonal pattern means that we typically experience higher revenues and orders during our fourth quarter as manufacturers ramp up production and then decline in our first quarter 
we also experience larger volumes of business in our fourth quarter for products that we sell to the aerospace and defense industry and the us government and generally experience reduced volumes during our first quarter 
however  in the fourth quarter of our usual seasonal increase in revenues and orders did not occur 
we experienced a decline in orders in the third and fourth quarter largely in the semiconductor and wireless handset manufacturing test markets 
orders in were up by percent  with much of that growth in the first half of the year 
test and measurement orders increased percent year over year related to a strong aerospace and defense industry  growth in consumer electronics  and expansion of the asian handset manufacturing capacity 
semiconductor products orders grew percent over  with strength in the personal systems market  offset by a decline in the networking market 
our automated test business saw a slight decline in orders over the prior year  caused by a market decrease in the second half of the year 
orders increased percent over last year in the life sciences and chemical analysis markets 
this increase was driven by the demand for replacement systems over our large 
table of contents installed base  increased us government spending for homeland security  spending related to environmental testing in asia  and increased demand from generic drug manufacturers 
annual revenues were at their highest level since net revenue for the year was  million  an increase of percent over our test and measurement and our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses experienced revenue growth throughout however our automated test and semiconductor products business experienced revenue declines in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
these declines were in large part due to our customers excess capacity and excess inventory in the semiconductor industry 
cost of sales as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points from to this is a reflection of our continued work on lowering our cost structure 
we will continue to see the benefits of a more variable cost structure  including the impact of using contract manufacturers and third party service providers 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue have declined from percent in and percent in to percent in in dollar terms  operating expenses have declined million from to and million from to reduced restructuring and asset impairment charges  coupled with increased savings from these efforts  account for the majority of the expense reduction in both years 
in  pension and post retirement benefits decreased by million due to additional funding  better investment results and a favorable interest rate environment 
our efforts to reduce our infrastructure costs and to control discretionary spending also contributed to the decrease 
we completed the implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp and customer relationship management crm projects  and have now begun to see some of the benefits in cost savings and operational improvement 
total cash and cash equivalents increased million to billion at october  net cash provided from operating activities was million for cash on hand as of october  was  million 
days sales outstanding decreased to days as of october  from days a year ago 
we have improved our inventory days on hand from days as of october  to days as of the end of the current period 
income from operations in was million  an increase of approximately  million 
the increase was due to an increase in revenue of  million  as well as the benefit of our restructuring plans 
as we increased our revenues  we continued to keep spending under tight control allowing this revenue increase to fully impact our profit increase 
looking forward  we expect increases in the test and measurement and life sciences and chemical analysis markets in we expect the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment markets to be slightly down 
we intend to further reduce our costs and expenses to meet our operating cost structure goals 
the announced sale of our camera module business is not expected to have a material impact on operating profits in the revenues for associated with the camera module business were approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the 
table of contents estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  restructuring and asset impairment charges  inventory valuation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns and distributor price protection  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairment charges are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab  emerging issues task force  liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and lastly  sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic 
table of contents conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
retirement and post retirement plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate  which are used to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of october   the expected long term rate of return in the us was percent  and ranged from to percent for our plans outside the us we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective 
management will continue to assess the assumptions on the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the us and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions were based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
we are also required to make assumptions for the long term health care cost trend rates for our post retirement benefit plans 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our benefit plan expenses would also change 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would result in increased pension expense of million for in the us and million for for all plans outside the us retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
workforce related events such as restructuring cause curtailment and settlement gains or losses when they have a material impact on the average future working lifetime or total number of participants in our retirement and postretirement plans 
our restructuring programs have resulted in material changes to our plan demographics in the us and several other countries in and the curtailment and settlement gains and losses related to each event are separately identified in note  retirement plans and post retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets 
we performed our fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization  at that time  we concluded that we did not have any impairment 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
we incurred million of asset impairment charges in  primarily relating to a manufacturing site in california 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses  which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we then determine the carrying value of these businesses 
we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets 
table of contents and liabilities to these businesses 
we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we performed the required transitional impairment test upon our adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of and recorded a million charge related to goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets such as our property plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of billion  which included approximately billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of resulting in an approximately billion net tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and in the uk jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence  which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
profits or losses incurred in the us and the us affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance 
we expect that pre tax income in fiscal will be recognized at a lower rate because future income taxes in the us and the uk will be offset against adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions 
income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on a portion of our non us subsidiaries undistributed income as of october  because we intend to reinvest such income indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 

table of contents on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of percent for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca  at an effective tax cost of percent on any such repatriated foreign earnings 
agilent may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we have begun an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision 
however  agilent does not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that agilent is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax is between zero and million 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
restructuring and asset impairment summary we currently have three restructuring plans one initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan  a second initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan  and a third initiated in the first quarter of the plan after it became clear that the actions taken in fiscal and fiscal would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
all of our plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability 
as of the end of  we have reduced our workforce by approximately  people approximately  from involuntary terminations and approximately  from net attrition to approximately  employees 
our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements 
we have exited more than production  support and sales facilities in the us  korea  japan  uk and other countries  representing more than million square feet  or about percent of our worldwide property 
we will continue to make lease payments on some of this space over the next five years 
we lease most of these buildings from third parties  and the closures impacted all segments 
in most cases  we are exiting administrative office buildings which house sales and administrative employees 
however  a small number of production facilities were closed as a result of our plans to consolidate manufacturing into fewer sites 
actions for all plans have been focused on segments that were impacted most severely by the market downturn primarily our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses but actions have also been taken to reduce the costs associated with support services such as finance  information technology  workplace services and to a lesser extent our other business segments 
cost reductions were initiated by moving manufacturing and some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions  reducing the number of properties  particularly sales and administrative sites  and by reducing our workforce through involuntary terminations and selected outsourcing of manufacturing and administrative functions 
our strategy is to move towards a more variable operating cost structure 
we have executed all key actions under our plan  although there may be changes in estimates for the consolidation of excess facilities due to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the time the charges were recorded 
our plan is complete 
we are continuing to see the estimated savings of million per quarter million from the plan 
table of contents and million from the plan that was initially projected 
the plan is still being implemented  however  we have already realized the expected million reduction in quarterly operational costs 
we expect to incur further restructuring costs and increase the savings related to the plan in the first half of we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges of million in for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements related to our and plans 
similar charges in and were million and million  respectively 
we will continue to make lease payments on some of this excess facility space over the next five years 
charges associated with workforce reductions and asset impairments related to our plan were million and million  respectively  for similar charges relating to all plans were million for and million for the restructuring accrual for all plans  representing future outlays  which totaled million as of october  and million as of october  is recorded in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

accounting of income taxes 
see the discussion of the potential impact on agilent in critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for income taxes  above 
acquisitions we made one acquisition during and three during  which were not significant to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these acquisitions were accounted for either under the purchase method of accounting as defined in sfas no 
or as a purchase of assets 
for the acquisitions accounted for under sfas no 
 the results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on fair values at the date of acquisition 
residual amounts were recorded as goodwill 
in process research and development write offs were insignificant 
unaudited pro forma statement of operations information has not been presented because the effects of the purchase method acquisitions were not material on either an individual or an aggregated basis 
foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet as our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
however  movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net income loss in the periods presented 
for example  the weakening of the us dollar throughout led to an increase in revenue of approximately million  which primarily affected europe and japan 
however  this was offset by an increase to cost of sales of approximately million and an increase to operating expenses of approximately million relating to those foreign currency movements 
our hedging activities resulted in an increase of cost of sales of approximately million for the fiscal year end october  the effect of exchange rate movements on our consolidated statement of cash flows was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
indemnifications indemnifications to hewlett packard company we have given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard company in connection with our activities prior to our spin off from hewlett packard for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
these indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  employee  tax  intellectual property and environmental matters 
the agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on form s filed on august  in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 

table of contents indemnifications to koninklijke philips electronics  nv philips in connection with the sale of our healthcare solutions business to philips on august   we indemnified philips for various matters  including product liability issues arising within two years of the sale agreement 
in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
indemnifications to officers and directors our corporate by laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors  as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request  against expenses  judgments  fines  settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to agilent 
in addition  we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board appointed officer of agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances 
the indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by laws and the indemnification agreements 
see exhibits and of this document 
we purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers 
since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made payments related to these obligations  and the fair value for these obligations is zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of october  other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the us and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers  as well as our suppliers  contractors  lessors  lessees  companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts  against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services  the use of their goods and services  the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities  the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts  usually up to a specified maximum amount 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material 
results of continuing operations income from continuing operations increased to million in from losses of  million in and  million in the increase in income from to of approximately  million was primarily due to revenues increasing by  million  gross margins improving by percentage points  while operating expenses were down million year over year 
the provision for taxes also decreased by  million year over year due to the  million valuation allowance charge in the increase in loss from to of approximately million was also primarily due to this tax provision of  million  offset by a reduction of million of goodwill amortization charges 
fiscal year was an improved year for agilent 
agilent had strong profitability in all four quarters of due to tight controls on our operating structure and percent revenue growth 
this is despite a weakening in our semiconductor related businesses markets  which we began to experience in the third quarter after a strong first half 
we have accomplished cost reductions via streamlining our it systems environment and the number of it applications 
this was brought about by the completion of the implementation 
table of contents of our erp and crm projects 
direct it costs incurred for the implementation of our erp and crm projects were million in  million in and million in we have also reduced our workforce to  employees from a peak of  in april the final step of our restructuring was the consolidation of excess manufacturing facilities and moving global shared services to lower cost regions and outsourcing services where it made economic sense 
our gross margins improved in we have reduced our indirect spending by approximately million 
this reduction was accomplished by focusing our spending with preferred suppliers and by continuing to reduce spending on it consulting services 
we have also continued to monitor our professional service agreements for savings and value provided to the business 
indirect spending has been reduced through a combination of stronger sourcing negotiations  demand management and compliance with our policy of using preferred suppliers 
we have continued to maintain our research and development expenditures in order to prepare for our future 
we introduced several new products including new proteomic tools and the industry s first fully automated lab on a chip system for basic research and drug discovery in our life sciences and chemical analysis business 
in our automated test business  we introduced a new memory test system as well as strengthened the systems on a chip platform with enhancements and new products 
we have also entered into the flat panel display test market with our acquisition of ibm s flat panel display business 
in our test and measurement segment we introduced the world s first gigahertz oscilloscope

table of contents orders in were up by percent  with much of that growth in the first half of the year 
orders were up year over year in all businesses except automated test  which saw a percent decrease over the prior year  primarily caused by our customers excess capacity and excess inventory that had built up over the second half 
we started experiencing a weakening in orders in the third and fourth quarters largely in the semiconductor related and wireless handset manufacturing test markets 
the order demand remained strong in aerospace defense  personal systems  life sciences and chemical analysis markets 
orders in were flat compared to  although during the fourth quarter of  we saw a marked increase from earlier in the year 
orders in were driven by an increase in orders from cell phone manufacturers and demand for components that are included in consumer electronics  such as cell phones  cameras  games  personal computers  printers and test and measurement solutions used in the design and manufacturing of consumer electronics 
net revenue in increased by percent over  including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
all of our businesses experienced this increase in revenue 
the semiconductor products market was very strong in the first half  but we have seen a decline as our customers work off inventory 
we experienced a similar decline in the second half of the year in our automated test business  which is also highly dependent on the semiconductor market 
geographically  net revenue significantly increased in europe and especially in asia pacific while having a modest increase in the us  canada  latin america collectively referred to as the americas 
this modest improvement in the americas was as expected as the economy in the us recovered and the excess supply of used equipment was depleted 
the strong growth in asia pacific was due to continued growth in the contract manufacturing and outsourcing markets in that region 
net revenue in was flat compared to  although during fiscal year we saw an increase at the end of the year during our seasonally high fourth quarter

total cost of sales as a percentage of net revenue was relatively flat from to cost of services and other as a percentage of services and other revenue increased by percentage points 
table of contents while cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly from the increase in cost of services and other was driven by increased materials consumption for our service and support businesses 
cost of products decreased primarily due to net incremental restructuring savings of million  and a reduction of inventory charges 
this decrease was offset by unfavorable mix and volume impacts and the unfavorable currency impact due to the weakening of the us dollar 
inventory charges totaled million in  million in and million in inventory charges in included a million charge relating to our camera module business 
inventory charges in reflected continuing weakness in some of our largest markets  particularly in the telecommunications market 
we experienced a significant decline in inventory charges in compared to primarily due to our efforts to effectively manage our inventory levels 
sales of previously reserved inventory were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased by percentage points in as a result of net incremental savings from our restructuring efforts of approximately million 
the actual decrease from to was million 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in from as a result of savings from our restructuring efforts of approximately million and decreased indirect spending of approximately million in these savings were offset by increased costs due to the weakening of the us dollar of approximately million 
our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies in communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
at our central research facility  agilent laboratories  we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas anticipated to be important in the very long term  foundation technologies research  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications research  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences research  which enables new measurement solutions to facilitate the development of next generation pharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics  and measurement research  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
the research at agilent laboratories represents less than percent of agilent s consolidated spending on research and development and is intended to be relatively high in technical risk and to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon  generally five to ten years out 
the majority of our research and development is nearer term and occurs in agilent s four business segments 
this research and development is aimed at improving the more than  products already in production and on new product releases 
because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses and at agilent laboratories  it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects 
we are committed to bringing new products to the market and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in compared to of the million decline  approximately million related to our ongoing restructuring cost savings 
the decline was also driven in part by the decrease in indirect spending 
the remainder of the decrease reflects our efforts in reducing our infrastructure costs and initiatives to control discretionary spending 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in compared to selling and general and administrative expenses declined primarily due to a decrease in goodwill amortization and impairments of million 
the decline was also driven in part by a decline in indirect spending of million  and incremental net restructuring savings of

tax valuation allowance and provision benefit for taxes years ended october  in millions provision benefit for taxes for the year ended october   we recorded an income tax provision of million as compared with an income tax provision of  million  for the year ended october  the current year to date provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in certain jurisdictions 
table of contents other than the us and the us during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of billion which included approximately billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of  resulting in an approximately billion net deferred tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and the uk in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent 
with the exception of other comprehensive income oci  this tax rate reflects taxes in jurisdictions other than the us and the us  in which income tax or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance 
from time to time the company undertakes certain employment  capital and other investment actions that subjects the company s income to reduce tax rates 
this tax rate may change over time as the amount or mix of income and taxes changes 
our effective tax rate is calculated using our projected annual pre tax income or loss and is affected by research and development tax credits  the expected level of other tax benefits  the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions  the impact of changes to the valuation allowance  changes in oci  as well as changes in the mix of income and losses outside the us and the us jurisdictions having varying statutory rates 
the income tax provision of million includes a million percent benefit for valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in oci items during  which is comprised of million due to increases in currency translation adjustments and million due to the elimination of the minimum pension liability in the uk under sfas no 
 adjustments to the valuation allowance may be required to be recorded to the provision for income taxes line item  even though the tax effects arose from changes in items in other comprehensive income 
for  the effective tax rate was affected by the charge for the valuation allowance 
for  the effective tax rate was percent 
in compared to  the lower tax rate in results principally from the company recording a net billion deferred tax expense related to the valuation allowance charge in combined with the mix of income and losses outside the us and us jurisdictions having varying statutory rates 
as a result of cumulative actions we have undertaken such as restructuring  geographic location of activities and other actions  our tax rate is lower than in the past and we expect it to continue to be lower in the future 
for  we expect an effective tax rate of roughly percent plus or minus percentage points 
general infrastructure and shared services overall  we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily through our restructuring programs and cost controls 
we have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance  information technology and workplace services  decreased the space that we occupy in our sales and administrative buildings and moved some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions 
compared to the same time last year  incremental savings for infrastructure costs for the twelve months ended october  associated with restructuring plans and cost controls were approximately million 
we allocated these savings to all businesses according to usage of related services 
the general infrastructure and shared services ended with approximately  employees  a decrease of approximately employees from one year ago and approximately  employees from two years ago 

table of contents segment overview agilent is a global diversified technology company that provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries

test and measurement our test and measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design  development  manufacture  installation  deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services 
our communications test solutions generated approximately percent of test and measurement revenues in while our general purpose test solutions generated approximately percent 
overall order activity over the last years demonstrates the cyclical nature of the markets for our test and measurement products 
orders dropped dramatically during percent and percent and grew percent year over year in orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders net revenue from products net revenue from services and other total net revenue income loss from operations operating margin deficit ppts ppts return on invested capital roic ppts ppts the increase in orders in compared to  was related to strong aerospace defense business  growth in consumer electronics dvd players  lcd tvs  cell phones and expansion of the asian handset manufacturing capacity 
compared to  test and measurement has experienced an percent increase in orders 
while our wireline test orders grew slightly from last year  we experienced significant growth in our wireless communications test primarily one box testers  network analyzers and wireless systems and general purpose test mainly driven by integrated circuit ic lithography and basic instruments like multi meters  oscilloscopes and counters businesses 
the decrease in orders in compared to was driven by the deterioration of the wireline communications market  pricing pressures  the competitive pressures of the used equipment market and reduction in capital expenditure spending by telecommunications providers 
test and measurement revenues were up percent year over year 
leading this trend in the communications test markets  wireless test revenues were up percent while wireline test was down percent year over year 
the good results in wireless test was in large part due to the expansion of cell phone handset production in asia 
pricing pressure and the used equipment market impacted wireline revenues 
communications test makes up approximately percent of the test and measurement revenues and wireless test makes up approximately percent of communications test 
general purpose test revenues were up percent year over year mainly as a result of growth in aerospace defense as well as in our logic analyzers  oscilloscopes and design software 

table of contents we saw a reduction in orders from wireless handset manufacturers in the fourth quarter of  as they began to absorb the excess capacity that they put in place earlier in the year 
this was partially offset by growth in our wireless handset r d products as customers began to focus on new cellular formats  investments in g technologies and the development of converged cellular and wireless network devices 
in the fourth quarter of  we saw growth in our wireless infrastructure test as top base station manufacturers continued to expand capacity of existing formats to upgrade or improve the quality of service 
in some regions  the expansion of g capacity has increased the need for additional test equipment 
we expect our wireless test business to remain soft through most of the first half as handset manufacturers rebalance their manufacturing capacity versus the demand 
in our general purpose test market  we expect to see continued demand from the us government and prime military contractors  as recapitalization and modernization continues 
net revenue for declined percent compared to  following the same trends as orders 
the decline in net revenue was primarily the result of the slowdown in the telecommunications industry partially offset by favorable currency impacts

inventory charges were not material for or and were million in the impact of sales of inventory previously reserved was million in  was not material for and was million for cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased by percent year over year in the reduction in was attributable to incremental restructuring savings of approximately million from consolidation of manufacturing sites  transfer of some manufacturing lines from sonoma  california to penang  malaysia and savings in people related expenses due to headcount reductions  benefit of higher volumes  and improvements in discount levels 
by the end of  the restructuring plans had provided cumulative savings to cost of products and services of million 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased in over by percent year over year 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percent year over year 
on a dollar basis  expenses were down percent  mainly due to million of restructuring savings and an million reduction in indirect expenses 
we have reduced our research and development headcount to match the size and focus of the business 
we have focused our development efforts on strategic opportunities that align our business with available markets and have cancelled new product introductions that would not result in an adequate return on investment 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percent in from due to restructuring savings and reduction in indirect expense savings

income loss from operations operating profit increased by million compared to on a revenue increase of only million 
aggressive restructuring through workforce reductions  reduction in our cost structure and strict discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results 
this resulted in restructuring savings of million for the test and measurement business 
this segment s return on invested capital roic was percent  negative percent and negative percent for  and  respectively 
automated test our automated test business provides test system solutions that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices  electronics primarily printed circuit board assemblies and flat panel displays 
our test solutions enable electronics designers and manufacturers to shorten the design to production cycle  lower manufacturing cost of test  confirm the functional quality of their devices and of their manufacturing processes  and accelerate the high volume delivery of their products 
the main driver of our customers business it  networking  and internet infrastructure are the consumers who drive the market for pc s  cell phones  electronic games  and similar consumer electronics 
our automated test segment experienced a difficult last quarter in as the business environment was much weaker than expected 
this segment is undergoing major product transitions in several of its product lines 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders net revenue from products net revenue from services and other total net revenue income loss from operations operating margin deficit ppts ppts roic ppts ppts orders in decreased percent compared to  primarily due to a weak second half caused by our customers excess inventory 
our customers also delayed purchases in anticipation of our recently released next generation flash memory and system on a chip soc test systems 
semiconductor test orders were down percent while electronic manufacturing test orders were up percent compared to last year 
in the fourth quarter of  our automated test segment reached its lowest level of quarterly orders since the first quarter of this downturn could continue through the first half of next year 

table of contents orders in increased percent compared to primarily due to increasing strength in the semiconductor test market as customers started to build increased production capacity for next generation devices 
this increase was mainly driven by demand for consumer products in computation such as pc chip sets  graphics  and networking  digital consumer products and wireless products 
in the fourth quarter of  our automated test segment reached its highest level of quarterly orders since the fourth quarter of and continued to achieve market growth through design wins 
net revenue in increased percent compared to primarily due to an improved marketplace 
semiconductor test revenue growth was mixed  with strong parametric test revenue from our investments in millimeter fabrication and wafer production test and solid soc test revenue 
revenue for our flash memory business declined percent 
services and other revenue increased percent 
services and other includes the sale of support for hardware and software  and the sale of services such as  training  application development and test consulting for new installations and our installed base 
we expect the downturn in orders we experienced in the second half of to impact revenues in the first half of net revenue in increased percent compared to primarily due to increased sales of our products across the board in semiconductor test such as  flash memory and soc  and electronic manufacturing test markets 
semiconductor test grew percent and electronic manufacturing test also grew percent

cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased in compared to our automated test segment continued to control costs through outsourcing to contract manufacturers  and monitoring indirect and direct material costs 
the decreases were driven primarily by higher revenue  savings from costs controls  lower infrastructure costs and efficiencies from outsourcing to contract manufacturers 
the pricing environment remains highly competitive 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased in compared to savings from cost controls  and efficiencies from outsourcing to contract manufacturers were offset by competitive pricing pressures 
in  integrated device manufacturers idms  design houses  and contract manufacturers focused on buying technology capability through high margin testers 
however in  as we saw signs of economic recovery  our customers added capacity and bought more focused cost effective systems 
pricing pressures affected the majority of our products 
we sold million of inventory in that was previously reserved compared to million in and million in 
table of contents research and development expenses in as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points from on a dollar basis  expenses increased percent compared to last year 
the increase is related to the company s plan to aggressively expand the breadth of its offerings in flash and soc test systems 
the percentage point decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue in compared to was due to aggressive cost controls put in place  which focused our efforts on more strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses in decreased percent from selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in compared to  while on a dollar basis  expenses were down percent 
the decreases reflect our efforts in reducing our infrastructure costs and initiatives to control discretionary spending 
in  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were down percentage points compared to  while on a dollar basis  expenses were down percent 
the decrease reflects our success in controlling discretionary spending 
income loss from operations in  our automated test segment achieved an operating profit of million  a rebound from an operating loss of million from this million profit improvement was the result of million in revenue growth  gross margin improvement and expense controls 
in  our automated test segment reduced operating losses by percent compared to while revenue increased percent 
automated test returned to profitability in the second half of the reduction in loss from operations in compared to was primarily due to higher net revenue and reduced spending resulting from our cost reduction measures 
in addition  operational efficiencies arising from outsourcing to contract manufacturers contributed to the return to profitability in the second half and improvement in this segment achieved a roic of percent in compared to a roic of negative percent in and negative percent in semiconductor products our semiconductor products business is a leading supplier of semiconductor components  modules and assemblies for consumer and commercial electronics applications 
we design  develop and manufacture products for the networking and personal systems markets 
our personal systems products  which accounted for percent of our revenue  are used in mobile phones  optical mice  flat panel displays  printers and plasma televisions 
our networking products include fiber optic transceivers for sending and receiving data over high speed networks and ics for enterprise storage and networking 
overall  marked the semiconductor products business s return to healthy financial performance  with orders and revenue growing over by percent and percent  respectively 
a small operating loss in was replaced by solid profit in after a strong first half of  this business  along with most of our industry  experienced a decline in the second half  due to our customers working off excess inventory 
the decline is expected to extend into  but we do anticipate growth opportunities for some of our new products  such as e phemt based front end modules and laser mouse navigation devices

table of contents the erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the industry and new products typically yield larger gross margins 
consistent with trends in the semiconductor markets  we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to deteriorate in however  as part of our normal course of business  we plan to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions 
the sale of previously reserved inventory  due to unanticipated demand for products previously considered to be unmarketable  had a small impact on year over year cost of sales comparisons 
in we sold million worth of inventory that we had previously written down  compared to million in and million in inventory charges were not material in any of the periods presented 
research and development expenses dropped percentage points expressed as a percentage of revenue from to selling  general and administrative expenses dropped percentage points as a percentage of revenue from to this improvement resulted from the increase in revenue from to in combination with expenses being held slightly under s level in absolute dollar terms 
total semiconductor products headcount was flat from to income loss from operations operating profit in of million represents a million improvement over the operating loss of million in  and a percentage point improvement in operation margins 
the segment s roic was percent  negative percent and negative percent for  and respectively 
the improvement achieved in drew from a variety of previously mentioned sources  such as higher revenue  erp efficiencies  restructuring efforts from early  and the continual release of new products 
restructuring efforts played a proportionally larger role in the improvement seen in compared to in the fourth quarter of we agreed to sell inventory and fixed assets relating to our camera module business 
we will continue to sell the image sensors that are a component part of the camera modules  but after the sale we will no longer produce the assembled modules 
we will retain intellectual property and research and development activities associated with the image sensor technology 
this announced sale is not expected to have a material impact on operating profits in the revenues for associated with the camera module business were approximately million 
life sciences and chemical analysis our life sciences and chemical analysis business provides application focused solutions that include instruments  software  consumables and services that enable customers to identify  quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products 
our seven key product categories include microarrays  microfluidics  gas chromatography  liquid chromatography  mass spectrometry  software and informatics  and related consumables  reagents and services

cash contributions in were approximately million or percent less than in in  we expect funding requirements for our various benefit plans to continue to decrease 
our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities  among other factors 
as the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status 
in  as in  we recorded no goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
depreciation and amortization decreased from million in to million in reflecting the reduced acquisitions of property plant and equipment over the past few years and the full amortization of other intangibles relating to business combinations

if we choose to redeem the debt  the holders may elect to receive common stock at the initial conversion price of per share in place of cash 
holders of the debentures have an option to require us to repurchase debentures  in whole or in part  on december in each of  and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases and vendor financing arrangements with cit and others 
we provide lease guarantees on these financing arrangements and we have no other material guarantees or commitments 
see note  commitments in item of this report for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
on february  standard and poor s rating services lowered its corporate credit and senior note ratings for agilent to speculative grade status  from bbb minus to bb 
on may  moody s investors service downgraded its senior unsecured rating of agilent from baa to ba moody s also assigned the company a first time senior implied rating of ba both moody s and s p attached a negative outlook to their ratings at the time of the downgrades 
the downgrades did not have any material impact on our liquidity

there are no financial covenants related to our senior unsecured convertible notes 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and other financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs for contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors

long term debt obligations 
our senior convertible debentures bear interest of percent per annum  or approximately million 
see note  senior convertible debentures and lines of credit in notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill the purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our allowance for inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at october  and  and are not included in the preceding table 
other purchase commitments 
relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
retirement plans 
retirement plan funding includes the expected tax deductible contribution planned for funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october

risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline 
we recently experienced reduced demand for our products and services in many of the markets that we serve worldwide  as was the case in semiconductor test and semiconductor products 
revenues in the semiconductor test and semiconductor products businesses fluctuated significantly over the past three years 
however  other markets we serve have stabilized or demonstrated growth  such as life sciences and chemical analysis 
agilent consists of several diverse businesses  and demand in our markets remains cyclical and volatile 
pricing pressures and competition remain especially intense in semiconductor related industries  which could prevent achievement of our long term gross margin goals and could require us to implement additional cost cutting measures to sustain profitability 
visibility into our markets is limited 
any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services 
for example  if the asia pacific market does not grow as anticipated  or if the semiconductor market continues to slow  our results could suffer 
as the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our test and measurement business  a continued slowdown in the semiconductor market could result in a slowdown in our test and measurement business 
also  if our customers markets decline  we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us 
such decline could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 
also  in such an environment  pricing pressures could intensify  and if we were unable to respond quickly enough this could further reduce our gross margins 

table of contents finally  we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing at some time in the future  and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms when required 
if our senior unsecured convertible notes rating is downgraded  we could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future borrowing needs and we may have stricter terms 
we may not be successful in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure  and the actions that we take in order to accomplish this transition could have long term adverse effects on our business 
we have taken  and continue to take  various actions to transition our company to a reduced cost structure 
in response to declining revenues  beginning in we scaled back our operations  reduced our expenses  decreased our workforce by approximately one third  froze hiring  cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending 
we also initiated facility closures to reduce production levels 
although our revenues are no longer declining  we continue to take steps to reach or maintain our quarterly operating cost structure goal 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and hold them at a level necessary to sustain or increase profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges and cause us to take additional actions 
our expenses were higher than anticipated during the second quarter of  which adversely affected our performance 
as we grow  we expect to face ongoing pressure to control expenses 
if we are not able to hold down expenses we may have to further reduce our workforce 
there is also the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products  to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete and to operate effectively 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be  which would adversely affect our stock price 
if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
in addition  many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  price our products competitively  
table of contents anticipate our competitors development of new products  services or technological innovations  and control product quality in our manufacturing process 
dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation 
dependence on outsourced information technology function may impair our ability to operate effectively 
as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs  we have been outsourcing and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing 
if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer 
for example  during a market upturn  our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements  which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers orders on a timely basis 
the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control 
in addition  we outsourced significant portions of our information technology function 
since information technology is critical to our operations  any failure to perform on the part of the contract manufacturers could impair our ability to operate effectively 
in addition to the risks outlined above  problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues  and impact our results of operations and our stock price 
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries  and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 
future changes in financial accounting standards or taxation rules may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or a change in existing taxation rules can have a significant effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
these new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  under the newly issued sfas no 
r we will be required to account for equity under our stock plans as a compensation expense and our net income and net income per share will be significantly reduced 
currently  we record compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value 
for option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value  we calculate compensation expense and disclose their impact on net income loss and net income loss per share  as well as the impact of all stock based compensation expense in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires agilent to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our fourth quarter of  and will require agilent to expense sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights  as compensation cost 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the senior convertible debentures 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
these results are also dependent on the seasonal and cyclical nature of our end markets such as consumer electronics  including cell phones 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
if we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall  this may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 

table of contents our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match our demand 
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet our expectations  our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements 
if  during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments  we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner 
this inability could materially and adversely affect our results 
by contrast  during the economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications  electronics and semiconductor industries 
the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity adversely affected  and could in the future affect our income 
failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 
our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations  including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate 
the sale of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
for example  the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile  making demand difficult to anticipate 
during a market upturn  we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand  which could materially affect our results 
in addition  some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 
should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component  we would be forced to reengineer our product 
in addition to discontinuing parts  suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
by contrast  in order to secure components for the production of products  we may continue to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors  or at times make advance payments to suppliers  which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications  semiconductor and electronics products has decreased 
if demand for our products is less than we expect  we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our employees  contract manufacturers  suppliers  job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political  economic or other conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  
table of contents differing protection of intellectual property  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and geopolitical turmoil  including terrorism and war 
we centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations malaysia and india 
these processes include general accounting  accounts payable and accounts receivables functions 
if conditions change in those countries  it may adversely affect operations  including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables 
our results of operations  as well as our liquidity  may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
since  we have experienced temporary pay reductions  workforce reductions and limited pay increases  which may harm our long term ability to hire and retain key personnel 
as the market continues its recovery  there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit  and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 
our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 
any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers 
table of contents also purchase other agilent products 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
unforeseen problems with the stability and maintenance of our new information systems have interfered and could further interfere with our operations 
as a part of the effort to replace our current information systems  we implemented new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage our business operations 
our profit projections could be inaccurate if we misjudged the potential savings from the implementation of the new systems  or if we are unable to adequately maintain or adjust the systems 
in addition  if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures  we may be unable to improve or maximize our profit margins 
following the first phase of our enterprise resource planning software implementation  we experienced difficulties in providing customer quotes and in acknowledging and shipping customer orders 
although we believe that these systems are stable  as we add additional functionality  new problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlett packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hewlett packard 
hewlett packard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination  perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
in addition  hewlett packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation 
while hewlett packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties  remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties 
we cannot be sure that hewlett packard will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations 
we have agreed to indemnify hewlett packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hewlett packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hewlett packard 
while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties  subsurface contamination may exist  and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 
our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state and local laws governing the environment 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and 
table of contents outside the us  even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 
our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant international  federal  state and local regulations  including but not limited to health and safety  packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission 
we also must comply with work safety rules 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our businesses could be harmed 
some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture  processing  distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act  and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act 
we must conform the manufacture  processing  distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  then we could be made to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  or administrative penalties 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products or services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also 
table of contents require us to enter into costly license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses 
we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents  copyrights or trademarks 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and result in lost revenues 
furthermore  some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies  allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property 
if we suffer loss to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations 
our production facilities  headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california  and our production facilities in washington and japan  are all located in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 
in addition  since we have recently consolidated our manufacturing facilities  we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location 
although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
