the fair value of the total consideration paid in the acquisition  including assumed liabilities of approximately million and acquisition costs of million  was million 
the million in liabilities that we assumed included million of notes payable which were subsequently converted into our preference shares

lan yang  the chairperson and a major shareholder of sun media for a consideration of million in cash and approximately million of our newly issued ordinary shares and transaction costs of million for a total purchase price of million 
we originally accounted for our investment in sun media using the equity method of accounting 
we ceased to maintain significant influence over sun media s operations after our equity interest fell below and our board representation was decreased in the quarter ended december  accordingly  commencing october   we began accounting for our investment in sun media as an investment in marketable equity securities under the provisions of sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
such investment is classified as available for sale and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains losses  if any  recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
we had recorded million of equity loss from this investment through september  so the carrying value of this investment was million at the time when the accounting method changed 
the fair market value of this investment began to drop below the carrying value starting may at december   the fair market value of this investment was million 
we considered the decline in the value of this investment to be other than temporary and therefore recognized million as impairment of investment during the three months ended december  in november  we completed the acquisition of equity interest in shanghai techur technology developing co  ltd 
techur for million in cash 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets was approximately million  representing intangible assets relating to customer relationships  which was amortized over a period of three years 
because the revenue and the gross margin of techur did not grow as expected  we reassessed the carrying value of the intangible assets at june  and concluded that there would not be significant future income generated from these customer relationships 
the 
table of contents carrying value of the intangible assets of million was therefore written off during the three months ended june  due to the permanent impairment of value

if we are unable to generate sufficient net income from our operation in the future  we may have to finance our operation from the current fund available 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition policies advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising arrangements  sponsorship arrangements  or a combination of them 
online advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of our web sites  in particular formats and over particular periods of time 
advertising revenues from online advertising arrangements are recognized ratably over the displayed period of the contract when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
multiple element advertising arrangements are broken down to single element arrangement based on relative fair value for revenue recognition purpose 
in some of our advertising contracts  we guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenues are recognized on the basis of the number of impressions delivered or ratably over the period in which the advertising is displayed  whichever amount is lower  when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impression deliveries are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions deliveries are achieved 
for the year ended december   advertising revenues from contracts that require guaranteed minimum impressions were minimal 
sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our web sites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period of sponsorship 
advertising revenues derived from the design  coordination and integration of online advertising and sponsorship arrangements to be placed on our web sites are recognized ratably over the term of such programs 
revenues from barter transactions are recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed in our properties 
barter transactions are recorded at the lower of the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the advertisement given  provided the fair value of the transaction is reliably measurable

revenues from mobile value added services are charged on monthly or on per usage basis 
such revenues are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated 
we contract with third party mobile operators for billing and transmission services related to the mobile value added services transmitted to our users 
we record the gross amount we bill to our users for our mobile value added services as revenues and the fees charged or retained by the third party mobile operators as cost of revenues 
we considered eitf in determining whether we should recognize such revenues at gross or net of revenue sharing by mobile operators for billing and transmission services 
we believe that based on our arrangement with the third party mobile operators as stipulated in our agreements with them  the gross approach is appropriate as we are the primary obligor to the user with the respect to the mobile value added services 
our estimation of revenue is based on our internal records of billings and transmissions for the month  adjusted by prior periods confirmation rates with the third party mobile operators  and further adjusted by prior periods discrepancies between our estimated revenue and actual revenue confirmed by the third party mobile operators 
historically  there were no significant true up adjustments to our estimates 
to the extent that such revenues cannot be accurately estimated  we rely on the billing statements from the third party mobile operators to record revenues 
due to the time lag of receiving the billing statements from the third party mobile operators  for revenues recorded based on the billing statements from the third party mobile operators  we have adopted a one month lag reporting policy 
such policy has been applied on a consistent basis 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded million and million of revenues from our mobile value added services  respectively 
if we had not used the one month lag reporting policy  our revenues from our mobile value added services for those periods would have been million and million  respectively 
there was no significant mobile value added services revenue before the year ended december  we purchase certain content from third party content providers for our mobile value added services 
most of these arrangements state that the fees payable to the third party content providers are calculated based on certain percentages of the revenue earned by their content after deducting the fees paid to third party mobile operators 
our mobile value added service revenue is inclusive of such fees since we act as the principal in these arrangements by having the ability to determine the fees charged to end users and being the primary obligor to the end users with respect to providing such services 
fee based services allow our users to subscribe for services on our web sites including online games  virtual isp and paid email services 
revenues from these services are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated 
e commerce revenues are derived principally from slotting fees charged to merchants for selective positioning and promoting their goods or services within our online mall  sinamall  and from commissions calculated as a percentage of the online sales transaction value of the merchants 
slotting fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period the products are shown on our web site while the commission revenue is recognized on a net basis after both successful on line verification of customers credit cards and shipment of products 
product returns have not been significant and are assumed by vendors 
enterprise services mainly include paid search and directory listings  corporate emails  classified listings and enterprise e solutions

table of contents that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated

software license agreements are non refundable and allow the oem partners to reproduce our software products for a specified period of time for a fixed fee or a specified number of copies for a predetermined unit price 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of a master copy when the fixed fee agreements become effective or based upon activity reports provided by the oem partners under the per copy arrangements 
provision is made for expected sales returns and allowances when revenue is recognized 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop these statements generally require revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
our software product agreements do not involve multiple elements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts we use the rolling average bad debt rate for the previous twelve months to estimate the provisions for accounts receivable 
we also provide specific provisions for bad debts when facts and circumstances indicate that the receivable is unlikely to be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

determination of whether declines in value are other than temporary requires significant judgment

we believe that the terms of such service agreements are in compliance with the laws in china 
some of these agreements were reviewed by the tax authorities in china in the past and no comments were raised

in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation fin r to clarify some of the provisions of fin consolidation of variable interest entities  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the adoption of fin and finr for vies did not have any significant impacts on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that under previous guidance issuers could account for as equity 
it requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in balance sheets 
the guidance in sfas is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective on july  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and security market risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash to government or quasi government securities and in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
due to the fact that a majority of our investments are in short term instruments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure in this area 
as of december   we had unrealized losses of million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
our convertible bonds issued in july in the amount of million bear no interest and are denominated in us dollar and therefore there is no interest or foreign currency exchange risk associated with the outstanding convertible bonds 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues derived and expenses and liabilities incurred were in chinese renminbi  taiwan dollars and hong kong dollars 
thus  our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the currencies of china  taiwan and hong kong 
see risk factors currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting our ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if renminbi were to decline in value  reducing our revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as 
table of contents a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation during the year ended december  was not material to us 
investment risk on september   we acquired an approximately interest in the equity of sun media sun media group  a satellite tv broadcaster and a cable tv program syndicator listed on the hong kong stock exchange 
as of december   our interest had been diluted to as a result of issuances of new shares by sun media 
we invested in this company for business and strategic purposes and have classified this investment as a long term investment  which had been accounted for using the equity method until september  we ceased to maintain significant influence over sun media s operations after our equity interest fell below and our board representation was decreased 
accordingly  commencing october   we began accounting for our investment in sun media as an investment in marketable equity securities under the provisions of sfas such investment is classified as available for sale and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains losses  if any  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
we had recorded million of equity loss from this investment through september  so the carrying value of this investment was million at the time when the accounting method changed 
the fair market value of this investment began to drop below the carrying value starting may at december   the fair market value of this investment was million 
we considered the decline in the value of this investment to be other than temporary and recognized million as impairment of investment during the three months ended december  we will continue monitor the developments of sun media closely 
if the fair market value continues to drop  we will need to recognize additional impairment charges in the future periods
