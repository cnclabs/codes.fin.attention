item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
since we defined our aspiration and launched our blueprint for growth strategy  we ve gained some important insights 
we ve learned that to achieve sustainable revenue growth of to  we need to be even more intensely focused on our customers success 
we have always had a customer focus  but now we are intensifying that focus 
to better reflect our commitment to our customers success  we have decided to evolve our aspiration 
our new aspiration is to be the most trusted source of business insight so our customers can decide with confidence 
our intention to become a growth company has not changed 
but our new aspiration provides the way for us to achieve growth and create value for our shareholders 
while our aspiration has shifted focus  our underlying strategy remains the same as when we launched it in october our blueprint for growth strategy is the roadmap to our aspiration 
this strategy has five components  which we believe  taken together  will drive our financial performance leverage our brand  create financial flexibility  enhance our current business  become an important player in e business  and build a winning culture 
for the reasons described further below  we believe that our brand  our flexible business model  and our winning culture form a powerful competitive advantage 

table of contents leverage our brand we believe that the d b brand tm stands for confidence our customers rely on d b tm when they make critical business decisions 
this confidence is the product of dunsright tm a quality proprietary process that we believe is the best in our industry 
through our dunsright tm process  our customers have access to comprehensive business information that we constantly endeavor to make accurate  complete  timely and consistent  globally 
the foundation of dunsright tm is quality assurance which includes over  separate automated checks  plus many manual ones  to ensure that data meets our high quality standards 
in addition  five quality drivers work sequentially to enhance the data and make it useful to our customers in making critical business decisions 
each of these quality drivers is described below first  by leveraging our core competency in global data collection  we bring together data from thousands of sources worldwide and enhance it into quality information to help our customers make profitable decisions 
we have the world s largest global business database  with over million businesses in over countries  including over million businesses in the united states 
we update our database more than million times a day 
as a result  we provide our customers a one stop shop for global business data from around the world 
we integrate the data into our database through our patented entity matching process  which produces a single  more accurate picture of each business 
entity matching ensures that disparate data elements are associated with the right businesses in our database by doing such things as allowing and correcting for variations in spelling  format  trade names and addresses 
we apply our nine digit global d u n s tm number as a unique means of identifying and tracking a business globally through every step in the life and activity of the business 
we use the d u n s tm number to link headquarters  branches  parents and subsidiaries 
in today s global economy  the d u n s tm number has become a standard for business identification and verification 
the d u n s tm number is exclusively ours and is never reassigned to another business 
it follows a business through every phase of its life  including bankruptcy  and allows verification of information at every stage of the dunsright tm process 
we use the corporate linkage process to enable our customers to view their total risk or opportunity across related business entities 
linkage means we view each entity in relation to its corporate family  providing our customers with increased awareness of risk exposure  new opportunities to penetrate existing customers  and increased leverage with their suppliers 
finally  our predictive indicators use statistical analysis to rate a business s past performance and to indicate how the business is likely to perform in the future 
as an example  predictive indicators are used to predict the likelihood of a company going out of business or not paying its bills 
by providing predictive indicators  we make the information in our database even more actionable for our customers 
with the power of dunsright tm at its foundation  we believe the d b brand tm is a competitive advantage that will help us achieve our aspiration 
create financial flexibility as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability 
we view almost every dollar that we spend as flexible 
what we mean is that we view very little of our costs as fixed we make a conscious decision about every investment we make 
through the structured process we call creating financial flexibility  we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost 
specifically  we seek to eliminate  consolidate  standardize  and automate our business functions  or migrate them to the web 
after we have 
table of contents fully realized internal efficiencies  we evaluate the possibility that others can provide improved quality and greater efficiencies through outsourcing 
as part of our financial flexibility initiatives  we have eliminated non core operations  such as our receivable management services business  which we sold during  within our international segment  consolidated our european operations from separate country operations into one continent wide operation  begun to standardize our best practices  and substantially reduced country level management infrastructure  consolidated data collection telecenters  automated and simplified data collection from third party data sources  and outsourced certain technology functions  including our data center operations  and certain data collection functions 
since the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  we have implemented four phases of financial flexibility initiatives 
in each of these phases we identified ways to reduce our expense base  then reallocated some of the identified spending to other areas of our operations to improve revenue growth 
with each phase of initiatives we have incurred a restructuring charge which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
the initial impact of each phase on our expense base before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending  and the related restructuring charge and transition costs for each phase  are as follows phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  of which million was reversed in as excess 
it also resulted in million of transition costs incurred primarily in phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of it also resulted in an aggregate of million of transition costs primarily in and phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of it also resulted in an aggregate of million of transition costs in and phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in an aggregate of million of restructuring charges in it also resulted in million of transition costs in  with minimal related costs expected for in february  we announced plans to create additional financial flexibility through cross functional re engineering that is expected to reduce our expense base by million to million on an annualized basis  before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending 
we expect to incur related restructuring charges of approximately million to million in related to these initiatives 
the decision about how much to reallocate to other areas of our operations to drive revenue growth is initially made as part of our annual business planning and budgeting process 
we then revisit the allocation of our expenditures over the course of the year 
the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year our blueprint for growth strategy was launched through during this period  our total revenue 
table of contents declined by million  or  primarily due to the sale of non core businesses  partially offset by our core revenue growth and the impact of our acquisitions 
over the four year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million 
even after incurring these charges  our total operating costs were reduced over the period by million  or and our operating income increased million  or 
this re engineering phase will have a high start up cost  due to the use of consultants in lieu of in house staff 
as such  we will incur a significant amount of consulting costs  within corporate and other  in the first quarter of in april  we plan on communicating the final program estimates for each of these actions including final annual savings amounts  restructuring charges  transition costs  and headcount impacted by this series of initiatives 
build a winning culture by building a winning culture  we are transforming d b tm into a company focused on winning in the marketplace and creating shareholder value 
we believe that superb leadership will enable our transformation by driving the results that will lead to the achievement of our aspiration 
to build superb leadership  we have developed and deployed a consistent  principles based leadership model throughout the company 
our leadership development process ensures that team member performance goals and financial rewards are linked to our blueprint for growth strategy 
it also enables team members to receive ongoing feedback on their performance goals and on their leadership 
all team members are expected to have a personal leadership action plan that is focused on their own personal development  building on their leadership strengths and working on their areas of development 
we also have a talent assessment process that provides a framework to assess and improve skill levels and performance across the organization and acts as a tool to aid talent development and succession planning 
to measure our progress  we have an employee survey mechanism that enables team members worldwide to give feedback on our progress in building a winning culture 
we believe that our passion around improving our leadership daily to win in the marketplace is another of our competitive advantages 
enhancing our current business and becoming an important player in e business we have four customer solution sets risk management solutions  sales marketing solutions  supply management solutions  and e business solutions 
we believe each of our solution sets will contribute to our growth and enable us to achieve our aspiration 
we believe we have significant opportunities for growth because of the strength of our customer value propositions 
our risk management solutions help customers manage credit exposure and cash  our sales marketing solutions help customers find profitable clients and grow  our supply management solutions help customers manage suppliers effectively and save money  and our e business solutions help customers convert prospects to clients faster 
risk management solutions risk management solutions is our largest customer solution set  accounting for of our total revenue in within this solution set we offer traditional and value added products 
our traditional risk management solutions  which consist of reports from our database used primarily for making decisions about new credit applications  constituted of our risk management solutions revenue and of our total revenue in our value added products  which constituted of our risk management solutions 
table of contents revenue and of our total revenue in  generally support automated decision making and portfolio management through the use of scoring and integrated software solutions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion on trends in this solution set 
our risk management solutions help customers manage their credit exposure and cash by helping them answer questions such as should i extend credit to this new customer what credit limit should i set will this customer pay me on time what is my total credit risk exposure should i change my credit policies how can i proactively manage my cash flow we believe there is potential to grow our risk management solutions business 
in assessing the revenue growth opportunities in this product line  we evaluate the market from the perspective of a chief credit officer 
we believe that businesses today use our traditional products primarily to make large credit decisions on new customers transactions over 
in the current economic climate  companies are under pressure to find more efficient ways to perform traditional credit decision making 
to cut costs  companies sometimes reduce their credit staff resulting in fewer product users and or turn to internal or free sources of business information eg internet  which then reduces demand for our traditional products 
in addition  our migration of customers from traditional to value added solutions are not generating enough consistent new revenue to sustain risk management solutions growth 
to increase risk management solutions revenue  we are taking actions to mitigate the decline in our traditional products 
specifically we are developing a longer term strategic answer to the decline by investing to increase the power of dunsright tm 
for example  we are increasing the quality of our information by strengthening our database coverage and expanding the scope of the information we maintain about the businesses in our database 
improving our entity matching capabilities so that we can better meet our customers requests for information 
augmenting our traditional products through predictive indicators with new detailed predictive information 
in addition  to drive revenue in the nearer term  we are controlling price variances more tightly than we had in the past and implementing modest price increases 
focusing our account planning on our largest declining accounts 
ensuring that we continue to meet our customers needs and thereby achieve revenue growth as we migrate our customers to our value added portfolio management solutions 
in addition to actions we are taking to mitigate the decline in the traditional risk management solutions  we are continuing to invest in our value added risk management solutions to further assist customers with automated decision making and portfolio management 
specifically  we are continuing to invest to help 
table of contents customers make confident decisions on new credit applications for small  and under transactions 
these investments include continuing our alliance with fair  isaac company to develop and deliver a comprehensive suite of robust small business credit and risk management solutions for the us and european markets  and promoting our small business risk insight tm solution  our data repository that collects and consolidates performance data from financial institutions on small businesses across the lending  credit card  and leasing industries 
leveraging our investments in data house spa  which allows us to assist customers in more risk management decisions about small businesses in italy 
we are also continuing to invest in the portfolio management space  to help our customers manage the credit risk associated with their entire customer base 
specifically  in we promoted our portfolio monitoring and alert services  which allow our customers to easily and inexpensively track changes in the credit status of their customers  suppliers  competitors or even themselves 
we repositioned our automated risk portfolio management tools called ram tm  and we launched an enterprise version of that product  called eram tm  to better respond to customer needs 
we also invested in the sales and marketing of these products 
we are investing in these value added solutions because  in today s business environment  many of our customers have shifted from manual to automated decision making for both efficiency and consistency in decision making 
we believe that customers need to increase cash flow at a time when economic pressure is causing their customers to pay more slowly 
in addition  we think that customers are under pressure to make their credit functions more efficient  but do not want to take on increased risk to do so 
we believe our value added solutions help them increase their profitability and cash flow  while mitigating risk 
to summarize  we are taking actions to mitigate the decline in the traditional products  and we are investing in our value added products which are increasingly relevant to our customers needs 
sales marketing solutions sales marketing solutions is our second largest customer solution set accounting for of our total revenue in within this solution set we offer traditional and value added products 
our traditional products generally consist of marketing lists  labels and customized data files used by our customers in their direct mail and marketing activities 
these products constituted of our sales marketing solutions revenue and of our total revenue in our value added products generally include decision making and customer information management solutions 
these value added products constituted of our sales marketing solutions revenue and of our total revenue in see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion on trends in this solution set 
our sales marketing solutions help businesses find profitable customers and grow by helping them answer questions such as who are my best customers how can i find prospects that look like my best customers how can i exploit untapped opportunities with my existing customers how can i allocate sales force resources to revenue growth potential how can i maximize the return on my marketing campaigns 
table of contents we believe there is potential to grow our sales marketing solutions business 
in assessing the revenue growth opportunities in this product line  we evaluate the market from the perspective of a chief sales or marketing officer 
we also segregate our customers for this solution set into one of three categories based on how they tailor their sales and marketing resources and programs the enterprise customer with multiple business units and a high need for integration  a complex decision making process and potentially very high value per transaction  the business unit or mid market customer with independent budget responsibility  few sites per company but some need for integration and a somewhat complicated decision making process  and the small business customer typically with one location  a relatively simple decision making process and small value per transaction 
we believe that businesses today seek to grow by acquiring new customers and growing existing customers 
profitable  growing companies do both of these to some degree  and we have products and services to meet both needs 
our prospecting solutions are used to acquire new customers 
these solutions include our worldbase database  which enterprise customers license to create a prospect database  market spectrum tm  which combines information with analytic tools without extensive systems integration  and is best suited for our business unit customers  zapdata 
com  a web based prospecting tool for our small business customers  and our lists and labels  which deliver prospecting information in hard copy or on diskette 
our customer information management solutions are used to grow the value of existing customers 
for example  data integrator is used by our enterprise customers to integrate d b matching of data and information into their business processes for both front and back office benefits  corporate family tree is used by our enterprise customers to reveal previously unseen business relationships to uncover who their best customers really are  data integration toolkit is used by our business unit customers to integrate quickly with d b to monitor and standardize their business information  our data cleansing is used by our business unit customers to standardize name and address information in their data files to improve their internal data quality  and our data enhancement service is used by our small business customers to append our business information to their own customer data files to improve their cross sell and up sell activities 
sales marketing solutions revenue growth slowed considerably in the first quarter of compared with growth in  primarily due to weakness in the acquire new customers space 
we believe that this slowdown was due  in part to  the overall economic environment 
results in the grow existing customers space were much stronger 
we believe this was because our customers paid more attention to their existing customer portfolio  even if they weren t spending to acquire new customers 
in response to the slowdown  we invested in our sales force to help us execute with greater intensity 
specifically  we added percent more product specialists in the united states  which significantly increased sales capacity for our value added customer information management solutions 
we also added sales leadership in several of our international markets  each with a dedicated sales marketing team 
in addition  we invested in dunsright tm  and in other product improvements 
with these investments and the strong leadership of our team members  sales marketing solutions revenue improved steadily as progressed 
we believe our sales marketing solutions are well positioned for growth 

table of contents supply management solutions businesses use our supply management solutions to save money by leveraging the total supplier relationship and helping them answer questions such as how much do i spend on purchasing across my whole organization how much business do i do with each supplier how can i increase my leverage with suppliers to save money how can i be confident that this supplier will be reliable how can i know which suppliers are also customers how can i find new suppliers supply management solutions has historically been a small part of our business  representing only three percent of our total revenue in nonetheless  we view supply management solutions as a product line in which we can  with the proper investment and focus  grow 
to drive growth  we have created a suite of offerings that we believe enables customers to save money and time  by helping them understand how much they are spending across the organization  as well as what they are buying  so that they can achieve cost savings and manage their total supplier relationship

business segments since january   we report our business globally through two business segments north america which consists of our operations in the united states and canada  and international which comprises europe  africa  middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
prior to that  we reported our business globally through three segments us and canada  which we referred to as north america  europe  africa and middle east  which we referred to as europe  and asia pacific and latin america  which we referred to as apla 
in accordance with gaap  throughout this report we have reclassified prior period presentations to conform to our current segment reporting 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
north america 
our north america segment has offices and conducts operations in two countries 
this segment accounted for of our total revenue in international 
the international segment has offices in countries and conducts operations in ten other countries through companies in which we have a minority equity investment 
we also have independent correspondents in more than additional countries 
the international segment accounted for of our total revenue in as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our current business  we are implementing an international segment strategy to achieve a leading competitive position in certain markets 
we define a leading competitive position as best in class dunsright tm quality process  a leading provider of risk management solutions  
table of contents a leading provider of sales marketing solutions  and the potential to grow both 
we seek to achieve this leading competitive position through our company wide focus on best in class data quality with our dunsright tm quality process 
we will use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market worldwide 
as part of this process  we evaluate our competitive position and potential in each country or market and determine whether we can best achieve our objectives through continued direct ownership of  and investment in  the local business or by forming strategic relationships to enhance our quality data 
for example  in december  we formed a strategic relationship with bonnier affarsinformation holding ab bonnier  a leading business information provider in the nordic region defined below 
we sold our businesses in sweden  denmark  norway and finland the nordic region to bonnier  who will operate the businesses under the d b tm name and distribute d b tm branded services in the nordic region 
we will receive access to bonnier s nordic business information database for our international use  and provide technical support for the business under a year service agreement 
this strategic relationship will provide our global customers with access to expanded global data coverage  thus enhancing our value proposition and reinforcing the strength of the d b tm brand 
in this way  we will bring value to our customers worldwide  and create value for our shareholders 
internationally  since the launch of the blueprint for growth strategy  we have entered into strategic relationships in thailand  australia new zealand  singapore  indonesia  malaysia  japan  korea  israel  the nordic region  and most recently  india 
operating segment data and other information for the years ended december   and  are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
each of our business segments are subject to a number of challenges  which are discussed in detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
how we evaluate our performance we use the following financial measures to evaluate our performance total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses  which we refer to as core revenue 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange  which we refer to as revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
operating income and diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring charges whether recurring or non recurring and certain other items that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
we refer to these restructuring charges and other items as non core gains and charges 
net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software other intangibles  which we refer to as free cash flow 
core revenue is useful to management and investors because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in a single performance measure without reported revenue of divested businesses which will not be included in future revenue 
management believes that this measure provides valuable insight into the company s revenue from ongoing operations and enables investors to evaluate business performance and trends by facilitating a comparison of results of ongoing operations with past reports of financial results 
in addition  this measure is used by management to evaluate performance for compensation purposes 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because  while we take steps to manage our exposure to foreign currency  we believe that it is useful to investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another both with and without the effects of currency translation 

table of contents operating income and earnings per share before non core gains and charges such as restructuring charges is appropriate because they are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportional positive or negative impact on the results of our on going underlying business operations 
these non core gains and charges are identified in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should not conclude from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
non operating income or expenses and transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy  all of which are reported at the corporate level  are also not included in our segment results 
free cash flow measures the company s available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding necessary to support our ongoing business operations and to support our portfolio of product investment decisions 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure of net cash flows provided by operating activities  and does not necessarily represent amounts available for discretionary expenditures 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe these measures are useful because they reflect how we manage our business 
these adjustments to our results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance 
these adjustments to our gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods and to the evaluate performance of the business and for compensation purposes 
however  these measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  diluted earnings per share or net cash provided by operating activities  prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap and provide a reconciliation of our gaap and non gaap results in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  you should note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  or at all  the presentation of these measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
our products and services  sales force and principal customers our principal risk management products are our business information report  or bir  our commercial credit score and other scores  which help assess the credit risk of a business by assigning a rating or score  our risk assessment manager  or ram tm  and enterprise risk assessment manager  or eram tm  which help our customers manage their credit portfolios  and our monitoring products

our principle e business products are hoover s online subscriptions lite  pro  pro plus  advertising e commerce through www 
hoovers 
com  licensing of hoover s proprietary content  and publishing of the hoover s handbook series 
we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our products  of which approximately  and are in our north american and international segments  respectively 
we have teams of relationship managers and product specialists that sell to our higher revenue customers  teams of telesales that sell to our lower revenue customers and a team that sells to resellers of our products and data such as onesource information services  inc and lexis nexis 
we deliver our solutions primarily through the web and other electronic methods  including desktop and enterprise application software as well as through third party resellers and enterprise software vendors 
our principal customers are major manufacturers and wholesalers  insurance companies  telecommunication companies  banks and other credit and financial institutions 
our e business s principal customers are sales  marketing and business development professionals and executives with similar needs in small to mid sized businesses 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our company s consolidated revenue or of the revenue of our north american or international business segments 
accordingly  neither the company nor any of our business segments is dependent on a single customer or a few customers  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our company s consolidated annual results or the annual results of any of our business segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright tm quality process 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of relative market share and revenue of third party business credit information 
we directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc  which have traditionally primarily offered consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in north america with a broad range of companies offering products similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our direct competitors include acxiom corporation  experian information solutions  inc  and infousa  inc 
in our supply management solutions business  we directly compete with large consulting firms such as cap gemini ernst young and deloitte consulting  as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
on the web  hoover s competition varies based on the size of customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of pricing  hoover s pro and hoover s pro plus competes with other business information providers such as onesource  dialog  factiva and lexisnexis 
on the low end of pricing  hoover s lite mainly competes with free advertising supported sites and other free low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and cbs marketwatch 

table of contents outside north america  the competitive environment varies by country 
in some countries  leadership positions exist  while other markets are highly fragmented 
in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  for example creditreform germany  graydon benelux  coface scrl france  lince italy and experian uk 
however  we believe common links exist among some of these competitors through their membership in two european information network alliances  bignet creditreform experian and eurogate coface scrl graydon 
the european s ms landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers  due to a recent decline in revenues from their core businesses  have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream and growth area eg  euler hermes s launch of first source credit reporting service in the uk 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information products and services 
we believe weak economic conditions have also resulted in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy  above  we believe that our brand  our flexible business model  and our winning culture form a powerful  competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our proprietary dunsright tm quality process  our ability to attract local customers to the worldwide information services offered by our unique database  our ability to demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  the reliability and quality of our information  our brand perception  our ability to continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth  our ability to deliver business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  our ability to attract and retain a high performing workforce  our ability to enhance our existing services or introduce new services  and our ability to improve our international business model and data quality through the formation and successful management of strategic relationships in our international segment

our executive offices are located at jfk parkway  short hills  nj and our telephone number is prior to september   d b operated as part of a larger company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation old d b 
on september   the board of directors of old d b approved a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies d b and moody s corporation 
on september   old d b distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding shares of d b common stock 
in connection with this transaction  old d b changed its name to moody s corporation 
d b is the accounting successor to old d b  which was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on april  old d b began operating as an independent publicly owned corporation on july  as a result of its june  spin off from the corporation now known as rh donnelley corporation and previously known as the dun bradstreet corporation donnelley 
old d b became the accounting successor to donnelley at the time of the distribution 
prior to the spin off  donnelley was the parent holding company for subsidiaries then engaged in the businesses currently conducted by d b  moody s and donnelley 
prior to november   it also was the parent holding company of subsidiaries conducting business under the names cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation 
on that date donnelley effected a spin off of the capital stock of cognizant and acnielsen to its stockholders 
cognizant subsequently changed its name to nielsen media research  inc in connection with its spin off of the capital stock of ims health incorporated 
for purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between d b and moody s after their separation from each other in and to provide for an orderly transition  the companies entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement  tax allocation agreement  employee benefits agreement  shared transaction services agreement  insurance and risk management services agreement  data services agreement and transition services agreement

table of contents item properties our executive offices are located at jfk parkway  short hills  new jersey  in a  square foot property that we lease 
this property also serves as the executive offices of our north america business

item legal proceedings we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of the uncertainties related to the probability of the outcome and or amount or range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on our review of the latest information available  we believe our ultimate liability in connection with pending tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  with the possible exception of the matters described below 
in order to understand our exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between us and moody s corporation  our predecessors and other parties that  through various corporate reorganizations and contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation d b separated through a spinoff into three separate public companies d b  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution 
this was accomplished through a spin off by d b of its stock in acnielsen and cognizant 
in june  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to rh donnelley corporation donnelley d b  spun off its stock in a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation d b the distribution 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims and nielsen media research  inc nmr the cognizant distribution 
in september  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to moody s corporation moody s and also referred to elsewhere in this form k as moody s d b  spun off its stock in a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation we or d b and also referred to elsewhere in this form k as d b the distribution 
tax matters moody s d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
the status of internal revenue service reviews of these initiatives is summarized below 

table of contents pursuant to a series of agreements  ims and nmr are jointly and severally liable for and must pay one half  and we and moody s d b are jointly and severally liable for and must pay the other half  of any payments over million for taxes  accrued interest and other amounts resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on the tax matters summarized below other than the matter summarized below as amortization and royalty expense deductions royalty income  for which we and moody s d b are solely responsible 
moody s d b was contractually obligated to pay  and did pay  that million in connection with the matter summarized below as utilization of capital losses under the terms of the distribution  we and moody s d b have agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities of moody s d b that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to each party s respective business operations 
utilization of capital losses the irs completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during and and  on june   issued a formal notice of adjustment 
on may   an amended tax return was filed for the and tax periods  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
moody s d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   and ims paid the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing 
we are continuing to contest  on behalf of donnelley d b  the irs s formal assessment and would also contest any assessment of penalties or other amounts  if any  in excess of the amounts paid 
donnelley d b filed a complaint for a refund in the us district court on september  the case is expected to go to trial in  unless otherwise resolved between the parties 
d b would share in the final resolution of this matter with ims  nmr and moody s d b  as disclosed above 
royalty expense deductions in the second quarter of  we received on behalf of donnelley d b an irs examination report with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in specifically  the irs is proposing to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by donnelley d b on its tax returns 
we estimate that the disallowance of the and royalty expense deductions would result in a loss to us of million in pending tax refunds 
we also estimate that the net impact to cash flow with respect to the disallowance of the and royalty expense deductions could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits 
in addition  and also in the second quarter of  we received on behalf of the partnership associated with the above transaction an irs examination report challenging the tax treatment of certain royalty payments received by the partnership in which donnelley d b was a partner 
in that report  the irs is seeking to reallocate certain partnership income to donnelley d b in january  we received additional irs notices similar to those received in the second quarter of reflecting a net impact to cash flow of million tax  interest  and penalties  net of associated tax benefits associated with donnelley d b s remaining interest in the partnership transaction as described above for the three months in for which the entities were partners 
the net impact to cash flow with respect to our share of this income for the notices received in the second quarter of and january could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits 
we believe that these positions regarding the partnership are inconsistent with the irs position with respect to the same royalty expense deductions described above 
this million would be in addition to the million noted above related to royalty expense deductions discussed in the previous paragraph 
we have filed protests relating to these proposed adjustments with the irs office of appeals 
the parties are attempting to resolve these matters at the appeals phase before proceeding to litigation  if necessary 
if the irs were to prevail in its position  we would share responsibility for the matter with moody s d b  ims and nmr  as disclosed above 
if we  on behalf of donnelley d b  were to challenge any of these irs positions at any time  set forth above in a us district court or the us court of federal claims  rather than 
table of contents in us tax court  the disputed amounts would need to be paid in advance for the court to have jurisdiction over the case 
amortization and royalty expense deductions in the fourth quarter of  we received  on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b  irs notices of proposed adjustment with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in in addition  we received  on behalf of the partnership  various irs materials further explaining the examining agent s position with respect to the activities of the partnership in specifically  the irs asserted that certain amortization expense deductions claimed by donnelley d b and moody s d b on their tax returns should be disallowed 
we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the and amortization deductions and the disallowance of such deductions claimed from to date could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits but not taking into account the moody s d b repayment to us of million described below 
this transaction is scheduled to expire in and  unless terminated by us  the net impact to cash flow  based on current interest rates and tax rates would increase at a rate of approximately million per quarter including potential penalties as future amortization expenses are deducted 
at the distribution date  we paid moody s d b approximately million in cash representing the discounted value of future tax benefits associated with this transaction 
however  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  should the transaction be terminated  moody s d b would be required to repay us an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
if the transaction was terminated at december   the amount of such repayment from moody s d b to us would be approximately million and would decrease by approximately million to million per year 
in addition  the irs has asserted that royalty expense deductions  claimed by donnelley d b and moody s d b on their tax returns for  for royalties paid to the partnership  should be disallowed 
relatedly  the irs has asserted that the receipt of these same royalties by the partnership should be reallocated to and reported as royalty income by donnelley d b and moody s d b  including the portions of the royalties that were allocated to third party partners in the partnership  and  thus  included in their taxable income 
we believe that the irs stated positions with respect to the treatment of the royalty expense and royalty income are mutually inconsistent  making it unlikely that the irs will prevail on both of the positions 
if the irs prevails on one of the positions with respect to the royalty expense and royalty income  we believe that it is unlikely that it will prevail on the other position 
as a result  we believe that after taking into account certain other tax benefits resulting from the irs position on the partnership it is unlikely that there will be any net impact to cash flow in addition to the amounts noted above related to the amortization expense deduction 
in the unlikely event the irs were to prevail on both positions with respect to the royalty expense income  we estimate that the net impact to cash flow as a result of the disallowance of the royalty expense deductions  the disallowance of such deductions claimed from to date and the inclusion of the reallocated royalty income for all relevant years could be up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits 
this million would be in addition to the million noted above related to the amortization expense deduction 
we are discussing the foregoing assertions with the irs and are attempting to resolve these matters with the irs before proceeding to irs appeals or litigation  if necessary 
if we  on behalf of donnelley d b and moody s d b  were to challenge any of these irs positions  at any time  set forth above for years and in us district court or the us court of federal claims  rather than in us tax court  the disputed amounts for each applicable year would need to be paid in advance for the court to have jurisdiction over the case 

table of contents we have considered the foregoing tax matters and the merits of the legal defenses and the various contractual obligations in our overall assessment of potential tax liabilities 
we have million recorded in the consolidated financial statements made up of the following components million of reserves in accrued income tax  since we expect to resolve this amount within one year  million receivable in other receivables  representing the tax benefit for deductible interest  since we expect to realize this amount within one year  and million of reserves in other non current liabilities since we do not expect to resolve this amount within one year 
we believe that these reserves are adequate for our share of the liabilities in these matters 
any payments that would be made for these exposures could be significant to our cash from operations in the period a cash payment took place 
legal proceedings information resources  inc introduction the following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in by information resources  inc iri 
as noted below  d b has contingent liability for this matter as a result of contractual commitments undertaken in connection with various corporate reorganizations since  including our spin off from moody s d b in as more fully described below  vnu nv  a publicly traded dutch company  and its subsidiary acnielsen corporation acnielsen have exclusive liability for any final judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit  subject to a cap 
the cap is determined based on the financial ability of vnu nv and acnielsen to pay for any judgment or settlement 
under the contractual agreements described below  amounts in excess of the cap  if any  would be shared as follows for d b  for moody s  and the remaining is shared by ims and nmr a subsidiary of vnu nv for a description of the terms donnelly d b  moody s d b and moody s and the relationship between donnelly d b  moody s  moody s d b and d b  see page under the heading legal proceedings 
overview of the lawsuit in july  iri filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants a company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation and now known as rh donnelly referred to in this k as donnelley d b  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant corporation 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a wholly owned subsidiary of donnelley d b the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws under sections and of the sherman antitrust act 
the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited srg 
iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement 
iri s antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine iri s ability to compete within the us and foreign markets in north america  latin america  asia  europe and australia new zealand through a series of anti competitive practices  including unlawfully tying bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which acnielsen competed with iri  entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny iri s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data  predatory pricing  acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding iri s efforts to expand  disparaging iri to financial analysts and clients  and denying iri access to capital necessary for it to compete 

table of contents iri s complaint originally alleged damages in excess of million  which iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws 
iri has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed million  which iri also asked to be trebled 
iri also seeks punitive damages in an unspecified amount 
in april  the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of iri s claims and granted in part a motion by iri seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the court had previously made in favor of the defendants 
the motion granted by the court concerns iri s claims of injuries from defendants alleged conduct in certain foreign markets 
discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing 
the court earlier set a trial date for september the court rescinded that date in january and there is currently no trial date set 
the indemnity and joint defense agreement in connection with the distribution  cognizant now nmr  acnielsen and donnelley d b entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the jda  pursuant to which they agreed to allocate potential liabilities that may relate to  arise out of or result from the iri lawsuit iri liabilities  and conduct a joint defense of such action 
in particular  the jda provides that acnielsen will assume exclusive liability for iri liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the jda the acn maximum amount  and donnelley d b and cognizant nmr will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the acn maximum amount 
as noted above  acnielsen is responsible for the iri liabilities up to the acn maximum amount 
the jda provides that acnielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment  if any  in iri s favor the acn payment 
the acn payment could be less than the acn maximum amount 
the jda also provides for donnelley d band cognizant nmr to pay iri of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the acn payment 
in exchange  the jda requires acnielsen to issue a secured note the acn note  subject to certain limits and offsets  to each of donnelley d band cognizant nmr for the amount of their payment 
the acn notes would become payable upon the completion of the recapitalization plan described in the paragraph below 
the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of acnielsen without impairing the investment banking firm s ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring stockholder approval  and payment of interest on the acn notes and related fees and expenses 

table of contents for these purposes  viability means the ability of acnielsen  after giving effect to such recapitalization plan  the payment of interest on the acn notes  the payment of related fees and expenses  and the payment of the acn maximum amount  to pay its debts as they become due  and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business  as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan  for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented 
the jda also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment  then cognizant nmr and donnelley d b shall obtain the bond required for the appeal  and each shall pay of the costs of such bond  if any  which cost will be added to iri liabilities 
under the terms of the distribution  we would be responsible for of the total costs of any bond 
vnu nv s and d b s involvement in the lawsuit in  acnielsen was acquired by vnu nv vnu nv assumed acnielsen s liabilities under the jda  and pursuant to the jda vnu nv is to be included with ac nielsen for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount 
under the terms of the distribution  d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley d b arising from the iri action 
under the terms of the distribution  d b undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s d b for d b s obligations to donnelley d b under the distribution  including for any liabilities arising under the jda and arising from the iri action itself 
however  as between us and moody s d b  we agreed that under the distribution  each of us and moody s d b will be responsible for of any payments required to be made by moody s d b with respect to the iri action under the terms of the distribution  including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 
d b s potential exposure in the lawsuit as a result of the allocations of liability described above  we will be responsible for the payment of of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the acn maximum amount as adjusted to include vnu nv moody s d b will be responsible for the payment of an additional together constituting donnelley d b s liability under the jda for of such amount and cognizant will be responsible for payment of the remaining of liability in excess of the acn maximum amount 
ims and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the jda 
ims is responsible for of any such liability and nmr is responsible for of any such liability up to million 
however  because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the jda are based on contractual relationships  the failure of a party to the jda to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the iri liabilities 
joint and several liability means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing  the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants 
this is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made  including the allocations described above between vnu nv  acnielsen  ims  donnelly d b  nmr  moody s d b and d b 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the iri action or the financial condition of acnielsen and vnu nv at the time of any such outcome and hence we cannot estimate the acn maximum amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by vnu nv and acnielsen under the jda 
therefore  we are unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents hoover s initial public offering litigation on november   a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against hoover s  certain of its then current and former officers and directors the individual defendants  and one of the investment banks that was an underwriter of hoover s july initial public offering ipo 
the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and purports to be a class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the stock of hoover s during the period from july   through december  a consolidated amended complaint  which is now the operative complaint  was filed on april  the purported class action alleges violations of sections and of the securities act of the act and sections b  rule b and a of the securities exchange act of against the company and individual defendants 
plaintiffs allege that the underwriter defendant agreed to allocate stock in hoover s ipo to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at predetermined prices above the ipo price 
plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for hoover s ipo was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements 
the action seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
the defense of the action is being coordinated with more than other nearly identical actions filed against other companies 
on july   hoover s moved to dismiss all claims against it and the individual defendants 
on october   the court dismissed the individual defendants from the case without prejudice based upon stipulations of dismissal filed by the plaintiffs and the individual defendants 
on february   the court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint against the company 
the company has approved a memorandum of understanding mou and related agreements that set forth the terms of a settlement among the company  the plaintiff class and the vast majority of the other approximately issuer defendants 
the mou and related agreements are subject to a number of contingencies  including the negotiation of a settlement agreement and approval by the court 
if the settlement is ultimately approved and implemented in its current form  hoover s reasonably foreseeable exposure in this matter  if any  would be limited to amounts that would be covered by existing insurance 
if the settlement is not approved in its current form  we cannot predict the final outcome of this matter or whether such outcome or ultimate resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of any potential judgment in this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
pension plan litigation in march  a lawsuit seeking class action status was filed against us in federal court in connecticut on behalf of specified former employees 
the complaint  as amended in july the amended complaint  sets forth the following putative class current d b employees who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  current employees of receivable management services corporation rmsc who are participants in the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account and were previously participants in its predecessor plan  the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  former employees of d b or d b s receivable management services rms operations who received a deferred vested retirement benefit under either the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account or the dun bradstreet master retirement plan  and former employees of d b s rms operations whose employment with d b terminated after the sale of the rms operations but who are not employees of rmsc and who  during their employment with d b  were eligible employees for purposes of the dun bradstreet career transition plan 
the amended complaint estimates that the proposed class covers over  individuals 

table of contents there are four counts in the amended complaint count claims that we violated erisa by not paying severance benefits to plaintiffs under our career transition plan 
count claims a violation of erisa in that our sale of the rms business to rmsc and the resulting termination of our employees constituted a prohibited discharge of the plaintiffs and or discrimination against the plaintiffs for the intentional purpose of interfering with their employment and or attainment of employee benefit rights which they might otherwise have attained 
count claims that the plaintiffs were materially harmed by our alleged violation of erisa s requirements that a summary plan description reasonably apprise participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plans and that  therefore  undisclosed plan provisions in this case  the actuarial deduction beneficiaries incur when they leave d b before age and elect to retire early cannot be enforced against them 
count claims that the interest rate the rate is actually used to actuarially reduce early retirement benefits is unreasonable and  therefore  results in a prohibited forfeiture of benefits under erisa 
the plaintiffs purport to seek payment of severance benefits  equitable relief in the form of either reinstatement of employment with d b or restoration of employee benefits including stock options  invalidation of the actuarial reductions applied to deferred vested early retirement benefits  including invalidation of the plan rate of the actual rate is used to actuarially reduce former employees early retirement benefits  attorneys fees and such other relief as the court may deem just 
we deny all allegations of wrongdoing and are aggressively defending the case 
in september  we filed a motion to dismiss a majority of the claims in the amended complaint on the ground that plaintiffs cannot prevail with respect to those claims under any set of facts 
the motion did not address the claim in count that challenges the sale of the rms business as an intentional interference with employee benefit rights 
although we believe this claim is without merit  the nature of the allegation requires that it be addressed by a summary judgment motion at a later stage of the litigation after discovery has taken place 
we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of this matter or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business since january  we report our business on a geographical basis with two operating segments north america which consists of operations in the united states and canada  contributed   and of our   and total revenue  respectively  and international which comprises europe  africa  middle east  asia pacific  and latin america  represented   and of our   and total revenue  respectively 
prior to that  we reported our business globally through three segments us and canada  which we referred to as north america  europe  africa and middle east  which we referred to as europe  and asia pacific and latin america  which we referred to as apla 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  throughout this report we have reclassified prior period presentations to conform to our current segment reporting 
the following core product lines are sold in our segments risk management solutions our largest solution set  which contributed   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively  sales marketing solutions our next largest solution set  which contributed   and of total revenue in   and respectively  supply management solutions our next largest solution set  which contributed   and of total revenue in  and respectively  and e business solutions our smallest solution set  which contributed of total revenue in these core product lines  or customer solution sets  are discussed in greater detail in item business 
within our risk management solutions and our sales marketing solutions  we monitor the performance of our older  more traditional products and our newer value added products 
our traditional risk management solutions generally consist of reports derived from our database which our customers use primarily to make decisions about new credit applications 
an example is our business information report  or bir 
our traditional risk management solutions constituted   and of our risk management solutions revenue and   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
our value added risk management solutions generally support automated decision making and portfolio management through the use of scoring and integrated software solutions 
our value added risk management solutions constituted   and of our risk management solutions revenue and   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
our traditional sales marketing solutions generally consist of marketing lists  labels and customized data files used by our customers in their direct mail and direct marketing activities  and constituted   and of our sales marketing solutions revenue and   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
our value added sales marketing solutions generally include decision making and customer information management solutions  and constituted   and of our sales marketing solutions revenue and   and of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
for internal management purposes  we use total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses  which we refer to as core revenue  to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments  
table of contents because it provides an indication of the underlying direction of changes in revenue in a single performance measure without reported revenue of divested businesses which will not be included in future revenue 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
divested businesses include our receivable management services business  sold in the second quarter of  our australia new zealand operation  sold in the third quarter of  smaller operations in several other countries in our international segment sold during  our korean operations in the fourth quarter of  and our israeli operation sold in the third quarter of these divested  non core businesses have been classified as receivable management services and other divested businesses in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because  while we take steps to manage our exposure to foreign currency  we believe it is useful to investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another both with and without the effects of currency translation 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both including and excluding the effects of foreign exchange 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges such as restructuring charges because they are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportional positive or negative impact on the results of our on going underlying business operations 
additionally  transition costs  period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy  are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our segments 
when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on diluted earnings per share excluding non core gains and charges because such gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportional positive or negative impact on the results of our underlying business operations 
you should not conclude from our definition of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
these adjustments to our gaap results are made to provide both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance 
these adjustments to our gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods and to the evaluate performance of the business and for compensation purposes 
however  these measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  you should note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations  below  for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
our flexible business model and restructuring as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability during our transformation 
this is a structured process we call creating financial flexibility 
since october  we have implemented four phases of financial flexibility initiatives 
our financial flexibility process is discussed in more detail under item business our aspiration and our strategy create financial flexibility 
with each phase of initiatives  we have incurred a restructuring charge  which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations 
these charges are incurred as a result of eliminating  consolidating  standardizing  automating and or outsourcing operations of our business 
we have also incurred transition costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses to implement our financial flexibility actions 

table of contents we believe the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year the blueprint for growth strategy was launched through during this period our total revenue declined by million  or  primarily due to the sale of non core businesses  partially offset by core revenue growth and impacts from our acquisitions described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
over the four year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million 
even after incurring these charges  our total operating costs were reduced over the period by million  or  and our operating income increased million  or 
see results of operations  below  for a more complete discussion of our financial results  including these restructuring charges 
our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the actual results become known 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we offer substantially all of our us based employees coverage in a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the internal revenue code 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees who retire after age with years of vesting service are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are also determined actuarially 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  our pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by our outside actuaries 
the key assumptions we have made for our us plans  which we evaluate annually  include expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments 
discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
it is based on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds 

table of contents rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators 
health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our financial statements is the change in the expected long term rate of return on assets for the us qualified plan 
at the beginning of  we lowered this assumption to from the assumption we used to calculate pension income in and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
this one percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return has reduced our annual operating income by million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
generally  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return of our us plans will increase or decrease the net periodic pension income by approximately million 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
these rates are adjusted yearly  based on the factors noted above 
for example  as of december   we lowered the discount rate to from used at december  we expect that this one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate applied with respect to the us qualified and non qualified plans will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to average the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total unrecognized actuarial losses as of december  was million  of which million was attributable to the us qualified plan  million was attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
we do not expect to recognize in our net periodic pension cost any of the unrecognized loss attributable to the us qualified plan  as this loss is unlikely to exceed the corridor threshold under sfas no 
for the us non qualified plans and us plans  we expect to recognize losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million and million  respectively  approximately the same as differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic income for our pension plans of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
this income was driven principally by the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
in and  we incurred investment gains of million and losses of million  respectively  in our pension plans  of which million of gains and million of losses  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan 
at january   the market related value of our us qualified plan was  million  which excludes million of unrecognized investment losses from prior periods that will reduce the market related value in future years 
if these unrecognized losses are not recovered in future years  our market related value of assets will decrease  causing our expected return on plan assets and our net periodic pension income to fall 

table of contents changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in a significant future charge to our equity 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 if the plan asset value falls below the related accumulated benefit obligation  we would be required to record a minimum pension liability for the deficient amount and reverse our prepaid pension cost 
this charge would be recorded against a component of shareholders equity net of applicable deferred taxes 
we recognized a million  a million and a million charge  net of applicable tax  to equity for minimum pension liabilities related to our us non qualified plan and our us plans for  and  respectively 
the us qualified plan  our principal plan  is currently over funded 
the excess of the fair value of plan assets over the related accumulated benefit obligation was million at december   compared with million at december  the prepaid pension cost associated with this plan was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our pension plans by changing the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
for the non qualified plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was signed into law 
the act expands medicare  primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligibles starting in the act provides employers currently providing postretirement prescription drug benefits with a range of options for coordinating with the new government sponsored program potentially to reduce this benefit  including providing for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law 
in connection with the act  the fasb has issued a position statement permitting a company that provides prescription drug benefits to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of this act 
pursuant to this guidance  we have chosen to defer recognition of the potential effects of the act in our financial statements 
this decision was made largely due to the number of open questions about select provisions of the act and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance concerning certain technical matters 
therefore  the postretirement benefit obligations and costs reported in our financial statement do not yet reflect any potential impact of the act 
d b will review its retiree health care strategy in light of the act 
we may need to amend our retiree health program in order to obtain the financial benefits allowed under the new medicare prescription drug program 
for information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements  please see future liquidity sources and uses of funds pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements on page also see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

during the year  within our risk management solutions we have added product development resources  increased our sales force  and improved our post sale delivery service 
the growth in the product line was driven by both our north american and international segments 
traditional risk management solutions was flat before the effects of foreign exchange compared with we continue our intentional migration of customers from the bir and related products to our value added solutions to assist them in re engineering their processes 
the impact of this migration was offset by growth in other traditional products such as e portfolio  self analysis  comprehensive report  and monitoring 
value added risk management solutions grew before the effects of foreign exchange 
in our value added risk management solutions  our portfolio management solution products continued to perform well  which reflects the benefits of our recent investment spending in enterprise risk assessment manager  that helps customers manage their credit portfolios 
additionally  the increase was driven by our customers preference to continue to automate their decision making processes through products such as global decision maker tm  and integrate existing systems using our toolkit solutions 
an million  or  growth in sales marketing solutions before the effect of foreign exchange  driven by the growth in our north american segment 
traditional sales marketing solutions declined before the effects of foreign exchange  compared with the decline is indicative of the current economic environment 
this is the area of our business that is the most sensitive to changes in the economy  as sales and marketing expenses are often viewed as discretionary spending by our customers 
we also continue to see competitive pricing pressures in our low end list and label business 
value added sales marketing solutions grew before the effects of foreign exchange  primarily driven by our customer information management cim products and our high end prospecting solutions  including market spectrum tm 
specifically  within the united states  we have added additional product specialists  significantly increasing sales capacity relating to our high end  
table of contents cim products 
we also added sales leadership in several of our european markets within our international segment  each with a dedicated sales and marketing team 
a million  or  growth in supply management solutions before the effect of foreign exchange 
this growth came from both our north american and international segments  primarily driven by customers focus on improving their operating results by optimizing their procurement process

the acquisitions of imarket in the second quarter of  harris infosource in the third quarter of  and data house in the third quarter of  contributed one percentage point to our core revenue growth in on a product line basis  our core revenue results reflect a million  or  growth in risk management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  including one percentage point of growth due to the acquisition of data house in the third quarter of traditional risk management solutions was flat compared with  while our value added risk management solutions grew  both before the effects of foreign exchange 
as noted in item business our aspiration and our strategy enhance our current business  we have invested in our database to increase the power of dunsright tm to stabilize our traditional risk management solutions growth 
a million  or  increase in sales marketing solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  including three percentage points of growth due to the acquisitions of imarket and harris infosource in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
this growth is from a smaller base in as a result of economic weakness  the events of september and the subsequent anthrax scare  which depressed direct mail marketing activity 
traditional sales marketing solutions grew compared with  and our value added sales marketing solutions grew  both before the effects of foreign exchange  driven by investments to enhance our product offerings and by the addition of imarket and harris infosource to our traditional sales marketing solutions results 
a million  or  increase in supply management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange compared with a small base in  reflecting increased investment spending in overall  during the latter half of and throughout  the weak global economy adversely impacted our business 
in general  our customers spent less 
they took longer regarding decisions on purchasing our products  thus causing us to spend more time closing sales 
this in turn caused our sales resources to spend less time on new prospects 
in addition  some of our customers had gone out of business or combined with other companies 
when companies combine  their level of post consolidation spending on our products is often less than their pre consolidation spending 
in addition  the number of new credit applications  which is a major driver of demand in our risk management solutions business  had been depressed as a result of a lower level of business activity 
in addition  in a weak economy  customers increasingly look to free or lower cost credit information available from alternate sources  including the internet 
finally  companies were streamlining their credit departments  thus reducing the number of users of our risk management solutions products and  in some cases  product usage 

table of contents consolidated operating costs the following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income for the years ended december   and amounts in millions operating expenses selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charges net reorganization costs operating costs operating income as described above in the section how we manage our business  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on our operating income and  therefore  our operating costs before non core gains and charges  since we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business operations 
we have identified under the caption non core gains and charges below such gains and charges that are included in the following discussion of our gaap results 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  from to the increase was due to the following a million loss on sale of the building in high wycombe  england in july  additional investments relating to data and product enhancements  and an increased expense base as a result of the hoover s inc  data house  and the three italian real estate acquisitions 
operating expenses decreased million  or  from to as headcount in the data collection  fulfillment and technology areas decreased 
this decrease was also affected by the following charges included in operating expenses a million charge for the write off of capitalized software associated with products and internal use systems no longer in use million  write down of customer lists in europe million  lease and contract termination costs and miscellaneous other costs million  a million write off of assets lost in the world trade center attack  and a million impairment write down in the fourth quarter of for our murray hill  new jersey  facility  which was sold in the second quarter of selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  from to the increase was primarily due to additional costs relating to revenue generating investments  such as additions to our sales force to improve our marketplace coverage in sales marketing solutions  as well as additional variable costs such as commissions and bonuses incurred as a result of increased revenues 
additionally  we have increased our expense base as a result of the hoover s  inc  data house  and three italian real estate acquisitions 
the increase in the costs mentioned above was partially offset by administrative cost savings such as lower compensation costs achieved through our financial flexibility program 
selling and administrative expenses declined million  or  from to  as a result of administrative cost savings such as lower compensation costs achieved through our financial flexibility program partially offset by spending on advertising to reinvigorate the d b brand  training and hiring new leaders  additions to our sales force  and transition costs incurred in implementing our financial flexibility program 
transition costs were million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents we had net pension income and postretirement benefit costs of million and million in  respectively  million and million in  respectively  and million and million in  respectively 
the decrease in pension income in was primarily due to the one percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return assumption used in for our us qualified plan 
we lowered this rate from in and to in we consider these amounts to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  net pension income and postretirement benefit costs are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
we expect pension income will be approximately the same in as in in the fourth quarter of  an amendment was made to d b s postretirement benefit plan 
starting january   we will limit the amount of our insurance premium contribution based on the amount d b contributed in per retiree 
this change is expected to reduce our annual postretirement benefit costs by approximately million a year for the next five to six years 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  from to and million  or  from to the decrease in was largely driven by the sale of our facility in high wycombe  england in and the sale of our facilities in berkeley heights and murray hill  new jersey in  lower capitalized spending in  and the impact of our outsourcing of certain technology functions to computer sciences corporation csc 
the lower capitalized spending is a result of d b delivering more products over the web  and in turn  resulting in investment projects becoming less capital intensive 
the decrease in resulted from the write off and sale of certain assets in in connection with our financial flexibility program  the previously mentioned outsourcing  and the impact of no longer amortizing goodwill in  which reduced amortization expense by million compared with see note to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges we have incurred charges related to our financial flexibility program in each of the past four years 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges in connection with the fourth phase of our financial flexibility program 
the charge includes million for severance and termination costs related to approximately employees including a million pension plan curtailment charge due to the fourth phase as discussed in the following paragraph and million for lease termination obligations 
as of september   all of the approximately employees had been terminated under the fourth phase of our financial flexibility program 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we are required to recognize a one time curtailment charge for the estimated pension expense impact to the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account the us qualified plan related to the headcount actions of the fourth phase of our financial flexibility program announced on january  the curtailment accounting requirement of sfas no 
requires us to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost and the cost of any special charges related to benefit enhancements that might occur as a result of the layoffs eg  full vesting 
for the eg qualified plan  these items cumulatively resulted in an immediate curtailment charge to earnings of million in the first quarter  which is included in the million severance and termination charge described above

the charge included million for severance and termination costs related to approximately  employees  million for the loss on asset disposals and the write off of assets that were abandoned including million from the outsourcing discussed in the following paragraph  and million for lease termination obligations

however  it was stabilized in as a result of our investments in database expansion  improving our match rate and product enhancements 
these investments have mitigated the following trends a decline in new credit applications due to the economic slowdown  streamlined credit departments  resulting in fewer actual users of our products  pricing pressures from some of our larger customers  the substitution of less expensive consumer credit information for making some decisions about new credit applications from small businesses  the substitution of the bir for free or less expensive demographic information that can be obtained over the internet  and our intentional migration of our customers from the bir and related products to our value added solutions to assist them in re engineering their processes and automating their decision making 
the performance of our value added products also reflected the benefits of our investments  particularly in those products that provide insight on new credit applications for smaller transactions  and in our customers portfolio management processes

the following table presents our international product revenue and operating income for the years ending december   and amounts in millions revenue risk management solutions sales marketing solutions supply management solutions international core revenue receivable management services and other divested businesses total international revenue operating income vs 
our international total revenue increased million  or  from international core revenue increased million  or increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
the increase in international s core revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of data house in the third quarter of and the additional italian real estate acquisitions in the second quarter  which contributed six percentage points of growth

traditional risk management solutions increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange  including eight percentage points of growth due to the acquisition of data house and the italian real estate acquisitions 
within our traditional products  we are experiencing competitive pricing pressures on our low end traditional products 
we are also experiencing a shift in our customers spending from higher priced  comprehensive reports to low priced  less detailed reports 
these competitive and pricing pressures have been partially offset by the continued success of our new monitoring product  e portfolio 
value added risk management solutions increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange  driven by the customers preference to continue to automate their decisioning process through products such as global decision maker tm  and integrate existing systems using our toolkit solutions 
a million  or  increase in sales marketing solutions decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
traditional sales marketing solutions increased by decrease before the effect of foreign exchange  and our value added sales marketing solutions increased increase before the effect of foreign exchange 
the continued decline in our traditional sales marketing solutions is indicative of economic pressures in the eurozone  compounded with low growth forecasts in larger markets such as germany 
we also continue to see competitive pricing pressures in our low end list and label business 
the improvement in our value added sales marketing solutions can be attributed to specific management actions that occurred in the third quarter those actions included the following i added sales leadership in five major markets  each with a dedicated sales 
table of contents team  ii continued increase of focus by our sales teams on value added products  iii expanded demand generation programs  and iv growth in linkage products resulting from our customers movement from cd to web based solutions 
a million  or  increase in supply management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  primarily due to the continued growth in our data rationalization products 
international s operating income increased million  or in to million  primarily due to the benefit from the positive impact of foreign exchange 
to a lesser extent  an increase in our acquisitions of data house and the three italian real estate companies  and savings obtained as a result of our financial flexibility program also contributed to the increase in operating income 
the savings from our financial flexibility program were partially offset by the additional cost base as a result of our acquisitions noted above 
the following factors affecting our international segment create particular challenges to our revenue growth in most international markets we do not have market leadership positions 
this makes us particularly susceptible to pricing pressures 
we also face entrenched local competitors 
european businesses tend to manage their credit exposures through credit insurance rather than through the credit approval process using expert business information of the type provided by d b 
in many local markets in europe  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources thus reducing our data collection advantage 
prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion across the international marketplace 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local markets 
we will continue to use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market worldwide 
in some markets  we are investing to strengthen our position  either through organic growth or by acquisition 
in other markets  we may establish strategic relationships to strengthen our global data coverage and our customer value propositions 
we have used each of these approaches already in different parts of the world  and we anticipate evaluating and implementing these and other approaches in the future 
additionally  we will also continue to leverage our dunsright tm quality process to establish leadership positions in our international markets

our international total revenue decreased million  or  from  resulting from the sale of the receivable management services business during  partially offset by a million  or  increase in core revenue 
the increase in international s core revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of data house in the third quarter of  which contributed two percentage points of growth  and the favorable effects of foreign exchange rate movements  which contributed four percentage points of growth 
in general  deteriorating market conditions in international have resulted in competitive pricing pressure and lower demand for our risk management solutions and sales marketing solutions  which is reflected in the results described below 
on a product line basis  international s core revenue results reflect a million  or  increase in risk management solutions flat before the effect of foreign exchange  including two percentage points of growth due to the acquisition of data house

a million  or  increase in supply management solutions increase before the effect of foreign exchange  aided by investments to enhance our product offerings made in the second half of to drive growth in this solution set 
despite declining revenue  international s operating income grew million  or  in to million  primarily due to the lower cost base obtained as a result of our financial flexibility program 
specifically  cost improvements were achieved in our technology infrastructure and development  administrative areas  and data collection 
the adoption of sfas no 
 discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  resulted in a million reduction in goodwill amortization expense in operating income growth also benefited from the positive impact of foreign exchange 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk  below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to achieve our policy objectives  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
in  we issued million in principal of five year  fixed rate notes that mature in march see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with that note issuance  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with notional principal amounts totaling million see note to our consolidated financial statements  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term  fixed rate notes 
the arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge and  therefore  the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
foreign exchange risk we have offices in countries and conduct operations in ten other countries through companies in which we have minority investments 
our international operations generated approximately of total revenue in as of december   approximately of our assets were located outside north america  and no country outside north america  other than the united kingdom  had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances 

table of contents our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
from time to time  we may also hedge the value of our foreign currency denominated earnings and investments 
we use short term foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of six months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and the swedish krona 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  in  we used foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the option contracts expired as of december  the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter  are fully disclosed within our financial statements and have a minimal impact on earnings 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  with net unrealized losses of million 
if exchange rates were to increase from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be million 
if exchange rates were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized gain would be million 
however  the estimated potential gain or loss on these contracts is expected to be offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions and investments 
therefore  a movement in foreign exchange rates would have a minimal net impact on earnings 
liquidity and financial position in accordance with our blueprint for growth strategy  we have used our cash for three primary purposes first  we have invested in our current business  such as the investments in our patent pending dunsright tm data collection and quality process and the creation of new products and solutions such as our enterprise risk assessment manager eram tm  e portfolio  global decisionmaker tm  data integration toolkit tm and supply optimizer tm 
second  in each of the past three years we have made acquisitions such as imarket  harris infosource tm  data house  hoover s  and a controlling interest in three italian real estate data companies 
third  we have repurchased shares 
during  and  we have invested million to repurchase million shares  or of shares outstanding 
this investment is in addition to shares we systematically repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued in connection with employee benefit plans 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares for this purpose using the cash generated from our ongoing operations 
in january   our board approved a new one year  million share repurchase program 
we believe that cash flows generated from our operations and supplemented as needed with readily available financing in the commercial paper markets are sufficient to meet our short term and long term needs  including the cash cost of our restructuring charges  transition costs  contractual obligations see note and contingencies see note  excluding the legal matters identified therein for which the exposures are not estimable 
we access the commercial paper market from time to time to fund working capital needs and share repurchases 
such borrowings have been supported by our bank credit facilities

we do not expect to make any contributions to our us qualified plan 
b represents projected benefit payments related to our unfunded plans  including the us non qualified plans and our postretirement benefit plan 
c the expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service 
a closed group approach is used in calculating the projected benefit payments  assuming only the participants who are currently in the valuation population are included in the projection and the projected benefits continue for approximately years 
financial flexibility program in february  we announced our intentions to implement the next phase of our financial flexibility program 
the actions associated with this phase  which will be implemented continuously throughout  include continuing to streamline our data acquisition to delivery process  re engineer business operations in our international segment  consolidate technology spending  improve controls and increase emphasis on business decision support  and consolidate our purchasing spend worldwide 
these program actions are expected to deliver million to million of savings before any reallocation of spending 
as a result  we expect to incur restructuring charges recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 in  of million to million associated with this series of initiatives 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur transition costs of between million to million to complete the actions embedded within the plan 
this re engineering phase will have a high start up cost  due to the use of consultants in lieu of in house staff 
as such  we will incur a significant amount of consulting costs  within corporate and other  in the first quarter of in april  we plan on communicating the final program estimates for each of these actions including final annual savings amounts  restructuring charges  transition costs  and headcount impacted by this series of initiatives 
share repurchases and dividends in february  we announced that our board of directors authorized a one year share repurchase program of up to million  funded with cash on hand and future cash flow 
this program is in addition to our existing share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans 
at current market prices  this represents approximately of shares outstanding 
through february   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
at current market prices  when we complete this program  we will have reduced shares outstanding by over since the beginning of we have not paid cash dividends since we separated from moody s in after considering all of the implications of the new us tax laws regarding deductibility of tax dividends  we have decided to continue our policy not to pay dividends to shareholders 
the sale of our nordic and indian operations in on october   we signed an agreement to sell our operations in sweden  denmark  norway  and finland to bonnier affarsinformation ab 
on december   the transaction closed and we received proceeds of million  consisting of cash of million  notes receivable of million and another receivable of million 
we will recognize a pre tax gain of million in the first quarter of 
table of contents on december   we signed an agreement to sell our operations in india and our distribution channels in pakistan and the middle east for million 
we will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of the transaction closed on february  potential payments in settlement of tax and legal matters we and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are at various stages of resolution  but could ultimately result in cash payments in the amounts described in item legal proceedings 
we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in tax matters 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements for financial statement reporting purposes  the funded status of our pension plans  as determined in accordance with gaap  improved to a deficit of million at december   from a deficit of million at december  the improvement was due primarily to gains in the plans equity investments and was achieved despite a decrease in interest rates which increased plan liabilities 
this is detailed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the improvement in the funded status is primarily attributable to the largest of our six plans  the us qualified plan 
the funded status of this plan improved to million at december   from million at december  for funding purposes  governed by the internal revenue service regulations  we are not required to contribute to the us qualified plan in as the plan is considered fully funded under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
if the us qualified plan assets remain at current levels  and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same  we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until if plan assets appreciate between now and  the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond if plan assets depreciate  we could be required to make contributions sooner than in addition  if the us congress does not pass the pension funding equity act  we could be required to make contributions starting in this act includes a provision governing the current liability interest rate to be used beginning in for calculating the additional funding requirement under the internal revenue code 
whether or not contributions are required  we may voluntarily make contributions to this plan sooner than  if allowable under internal revenue code funding provisions 
we expect to continue to make cash contributions to our five other pension plans in the expected contribution amount is approximately million  compared with approximately million in in addition  we expect to make benefit payment related to our postretirement benefit plan of approximately million in see the table of contractual cash obligations  on page  for projected contributions and benefit payments beyond off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions we do not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements 
additionally  we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions 
forward looking statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission  in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor webcasts 
you can identify these forward looking statements by use of words like anticipates  aspirations  believes  continues  estimates  expects  goals  guidance  intends  plans  projects  strategy  targets  will and other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying 
table of contents assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in  or remain invested in  our securities 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
demand for our products is subject to intense competition  changes in customer preferences and  to a lesser extent  economic conditions 
our results are dependent upon our continued ability to reallocate expenses to invest for growth through our financial flexibility program  invest in our database and maintain our reputation for providing reliable data  execute on our plan to improve the business model of our international segment and thereby improve our global data quality while realizing improved financial performance in that segment  stabilize the decline in the traditional risk management solutions transactional usage  manage employee satisfaction and maintain our global expertise as we implement our financial flexibility program  protect against damage or interruptions affecting our database or our data centers  and develop new products or enhance existing ones to meet customer needs 
we are also subject to the effects of foreign economies  exchange rate fluctuations and us and foreign legislative or regulatory requirements 
our results are also dependent upon the availability of data for our database 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected 
we elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document  particularly in the discussion of our prominent trends  risks and uncertainties  below 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors 
consequently  you should not consider the above list of important factors or the trends  risks and uncertainties discussed below to be a complete discussion of all our potential trends  risks and uncertainties 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time 
trends  risks and uncertainties we may be unable to achieve our revenue and earnings per share growth targets 
we have established revenue and earnings per share growth targets for and aspirations for the long term 
while we believe our initiatives to transform our business have established a platform to reach these goals  we have not yet attained our revenue growth goals 
in order to reach our goals  we are undertaking a number of initiatives to increase our revenue in each of our product lines 
for example  in our risk management solutions product line  we are introducing new report products and pricing options that will encourage use of our reports and data products  strengthening our automated risk decisioning and portfolio management solution products and improving the predictiveness of our data and scores for automated risk management of smaller transactions 
while we believe that our initiatives in each product line will be sufficient to achieve our desired revenue growth  no assurance can be made as to when or if we will be successful 
a failure to reach our desired revenue growth or to continue to reach our earnings per share growth could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 

table of contents we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth 
successful execution of our blueprint for growth strategy will include reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives that produce our desired revenue growth 
while we have been successful at reducing our expense base to date  our reallocations into initiatives have not yet resulted into our desired level of revenue growth 
if we fail to continue to reduce our expense base or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth  the market value of our common stock may suffer 
our results of operations may suffer if the economy weakens 
demand for some of our products is influenced by economic trends 
as a result of the economic climate  during the last two fiscal years  we experienced a reduction in the demand for certain of our products as customers have looked for ways to reduce their expenses 
the effect of this reduced demand was felt most acutely in our project based revenue in our sales marketing solutions product line in our international segment 
economic weakness may also result in certain of our customers going out of business or combining with other companies 
when companies combine  their post consolidation spend on our products is invariably less than their aggregate pre consolidation spend 
in addition  companies may streamline their credit departments  thus reducing the number of users of our products 
customers may also take longer to make spending decisions  causing us to expend greater resources and divert sales resources from other opportunities  negotiate harder on price and seek cheaper alternatives to our products 
in challenging economic times  price competition may increase  which adversely impacts our revenue and profit margins 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or difficult economic conditions are changing the way our customers use business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding lower prices and more from our products  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
for example  our customers have recently been switching from our traditional products such as the business information report  or bir  which generally offer raw information  to other lower priced products that offer credit ratings and decisions 
if we do not successfully adapt our products to our customers preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
recently  we have faced increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information products to help their customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming increasingly available  principally as a result of the expansion of the internet and as new providers of business information products and services emerge 
weak economic conditions have resulted in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

table of contents our operations in europe and in other regions outside the united states are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
our international segment accounted for of our total revenue in in particular  our business in europe is subject to many challenges  the most significant being we do not have market leadership positions in most european countries  making us particularly susceptible to pricing pressures  our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in many european markets  thus reducing the demand for information based credit risk mitigation tools  such as those offered by us  in many local markets in europe  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing our data collection advantage  and prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy in october  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion across the european marketplace 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local european markets 
our european strategy includes forming strategic relationships in certain markets with third parties to improve our data quality 
while we are applying methodical processes to ensure these potential alliances will create a competitive advantage for d b  there are no assurances that these alliances will be successful 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in our non us business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions we could be harmed by a failure in the integrity of our database 
the reliability of our products is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party inquiries  complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  including claims based on theories of negligence and libel 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our products 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the business partners to whom we grant non exclusive licenses  they may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  we cannot assure you that these licensees will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies 
we rely on annual contract renewals 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents we may not be able to develop the e business component of our strategy 
one component of our blueprint for growth strategy is to become an important player on the web 
to implement this component  we have acquired a web based business and are transitioning our business to a web based business model 
there are risks associated with a web based business model 
some of the risks are unique to our planned initiatives and others apply to any web based business 
for example  our business will suffer if we are unable to successfully utilize marketing to acquire  retain and grow web based small business customers  successfully accelerate the overall growth of the hoover s business  successfully develop new features to justify higher price points for hoover s services  develop products that are understandable and easy to use over the web  minimize disruptions in our service and other system failures that reduce customer satisfaction  develop features and sales channels in support of increasing market penetration of large accounts  and minimize difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of our web based products 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links or power sources 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect our data centers and related technology against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
we believe reasonable precautions are in place to protect our data centers and telecommunications links from events that could interrupt operations 
nonetheless  any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes interruptions in operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we are dependent upon third parties for certain services 
as part of our financial flexibility program  we have outsourced various functions  including certain of our data center operations and certain development functions 
if one of the third party providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us may suffer 
data suppliers might withdraw data from us  leading to our inability to provide products and services 
we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  direct contact with businesses through our call centers and by purchasing data from public record sources 
as we implement business model changes in various countries in our international segment  we are entering into agreements with a single provider for all of our local data requirements from those countries 
we could suffer a material adverse effect if owners or providers of the data we use were to withdraw the data  cease making the data available or not adhere to our data quality requirements 
if a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data  cease making it available or not adhere to our data quality standards  our ability to provide products and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material effect on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under item legal proceedings above  certain of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 

table of contents acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies 
in  we completed the acquisition of hoover s  inc and several data companies in italy these and other future acquisitions are subject to the following risks acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  and we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any acquisition 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data 
certain data and services we provide are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states  canada  europe and certain countries within the asia pacific and latin america regions 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy concerns  particularly as they relate to consumer privacy and the internet 
this concern is likely to result in new laws and regulations 
compliance with existing federal  state and local laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future international  federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of data  and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  may increasingly affect our operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
changes in the legislative or regulatory environments may adversely affect our benefits plans 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of illinois affirmed its earlier ruling that the cash balance formula used in ibm s pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions under erisa 
this decision  however  conflicts with the decisions of two other district courts and with proposed regulations for cash balance plans issued by treasury and the irs in december in addition  on february   the treasury department proposed legislation that would clarify that cash balance plans do not violate the age discrimination rules that apply to pension plans as long as they treat older workers at least as well as younger workers 
ibm has announced that it will appeal the decision to the seventh circuit court of appeals 
the retirement account formula used for our pension plan may not meet the standard set forth in the ibm court s decision 
the ibm decision may have an impact on d b s and other companies cash balance pension plans 
the effect of the ibm decision on our cash balance plan or our financial position has not been determined at this time
