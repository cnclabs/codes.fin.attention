as of november   the company makes pawn loans in its ezpawn locations and makes payday loans in of its ezpawn locations  ezmoney mono line payday loans locations mono line stores  and through its austin  texas based call center 
the company earns pawn service charge revenue on its pawn loans 
while allowable service charges vary by state and by amount of the loan  a majority of the company s pawn loans are in amounts that permit service charges of per month or annually 
the company s average pawn loan amount has historically averaged between and  but varies depending on the valuation of each item pawned 
the allowable term of pawn loans also differs by state  but is typically days with a day grace period 
the company earns payday loan service charge revenue on its payday loans 
as of november   the company markets and services payday loans made by county bank of rehoboth beach county bank  a federally insured delaware bank in locations and its call center 
after origination of the loans  the company may purchase a participation in the loans made by county bank and marketed by the company 
in of its locations  the company makes payday loans in compliance with state law 
the average payday loan amount is approximately and the terms are generally less than days  averaging about days 
the service charge per loaned is typically for a to day period  but varies in certain locations 
in its ezpawns  the company sells merchandise acquired primarily through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customer merchandise 
the realization of gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on the company s assessment of the property s resale value 
improper assessment of the resale value of the collateral in the lending or purchasing process can result in the realization of a lower margin or reduced marketability of the property 
in fiscal  the company s net income improved to million compared to million in fiscal contributing to the earnings improvement was significant growth in the company s payday loan balances and related earnings contribution  as well as improvements in its gross profits on merchandise sales and the absence of a cumulative effect of an accounting change  as was seen in fiscal partially offsetting these factors was the incremental operating costs at the new mono line stores and an increase in same store operating costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for losses on payday loans  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  observable trends  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management uses this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan revenue recognition pawn service charges are recorded using the interest method for all pawn loans the company deems to be collectible 
the company bases its estimate of uncollectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates  and the amount of loans due in the following three months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could increase or decrease the company s estimate of collectible loans  affecting the company s earnings and financial condition 
in fiscal  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  offset by million from a decrease in accrued pawn service charges receivable 
payday loan revenue recognition payday loans and related service charges reported in the company s consolidated financial statements reflect only the company s participation interest in these loans 
the company accrues service charges on the percentage of loans the company deems to be collectible using the interest method 
accrued service charges related to defaulted loans are deducted from service charge revenue upon loan default  and increase service charge revenue upon subsequent collection 
in fiscal  million of recorded payday loan service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million resulted from an increase in accrued payday loan service charges receivable 
the company considers a loan defaulted if the loan has not been repaid or renewed by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  the company charges defaulted loan principal to bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
subsequent collections of principal are recorded as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
the company s payday loan net defaults  included in bad debt and other payday loan direct expenses  were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  representing and of loans made in the respective periods 
allowance for losses on payday loans the company also provides an allowance for losses on active payday loans and related service charges receivable 
this estimate is based largely on recent net default rates and expected seasonal fluctuations in default rates 
the accuracy of the company s allowance estimate is dependent upon several factors  including its ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
changes in the principal valuation allowance are charged to bad debt expense in the company s statement of operations 
changes in the service charge receivable valuation allowance are charged to payday loan service charge revenue 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
the company believes it effectively manages these risks through its underwriting criteria  closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio  and participating in loans made by a bank using similar strategies 
inventory if a pawn loan is not repaid  the forfeited collateral inventory is recorded at cost pawn loan principal 
the company does not record loan loss allowances or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost specific identification or market net realizable value  the company provides an allowance for shrinkage and excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory 
the company s allowance is based on the type and age of merchandise as well as recent sales trends and margins 
at september   this allowance was approximately million  or of the gross inventory balance 
changes in the inventory valuation allowance are recorded as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of the company s inventory allowance is dependent on its ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  inventory turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold values could increase or decrease the company s inventory allowance 
valuation of tangible long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of tangible long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of tangible long lived assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
no impairment of tangible long lived assets was recognized in fiscal   or effect of adoption of new accounting principle the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  under its provisions  goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill and pawn licenses  which lowered amortization expense approximately  annually  beginning october  the company also ceased goodwill amortization related to its equity investment in a b  resulting in a  annual increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 
during the quarter ended december   the company completed impairment tests of its goodwill and pawn licenses 
the goodwill testing estimated enterprise value based on discounted cash flows and market capitalization and indicated an implied fair value of goodwill of based on the allocation of enterprise value to all of the company s assets and liabilities 
this resulted in an million  net of tax  impairment charge for goodwill  recorded as a cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle 
separately  the estimated fair value of pawn licenses was compared to their carrying value  indicating no impairment 
the company assesses its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of july of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
the company concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets in fiscal income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
in the event that the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be charged to the income tax provision in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a decrease to a valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
no adjustment was made to the company s valuation allowance in fiscal at september   the company reversed its million valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  based on management s estimate of taxable income in the three years following fiscal projected levels of pre tax earnings over the next three years  primarily attributable to ordinary and recurring operating results  are sufficient to generate the million required amount of taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets at september  the company intends to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if any 
uncertainties that might impact the realization of the deferred tax assets include possible declines in revenues and margins 
property and equipment property and equipment is shown net of accumulated depreciation of million and million at september  and  respectively 
equity in net income of a b the company accounts for its investment in a b using the equity method 
since a b s fiscal year ends three months prior to the company s fiscal year  the income reported by the company for its investment in a b is on a three month lag 
in accordance with uk securities regulations  a b files only semi annual financial reports  for its fiscal periods ending december and june the income reported for the company s fiscal year represents its percentage interest in the results of a b s operations from july through june stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  encourages expensing the fair value of employee stock options  but allows an entity to continue to account for stock based compensation to employees under apb with disclosures of the pro forma effect on net income had the fair value accounting provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
been adopted 
the company has calculated the fair value of options granted in these periods using the black scholes option pricing model and has disclosed the pro forma impact on net income in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
disclosure and internal controls based on an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures  accounting policies  and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and procedures  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company in all material respects 
there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation 
management identified no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls 
other risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report as well as changes in business strategies  could adversely impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows in future periods 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company s fiscal pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from fiscal to million 
the improvement was due to a larger average outstanding pawn loan balance in fiscal  with yields remaining constant at 
fiscal sales increased million from fiscal to million 
the increase was due to a million increase in jewelry scrapping and a million increase in same store merchandise sales 
below is a summary of fiscal and sales and margins fiscal year ended september  dollars in millions merchandise sales jewelry scrapping sales total sales gross profit on merchandise sales gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales gross margin on merchandise sales gross margin on jewelry scrapping sales overall gross margin fiscal overall gross margins on sales increased percentage points from fiscal to 
margins on merchandise sales increased percentage points as a result of less discounting and more conservative loan values on forfeited collateral 
jewelry scrapping margins improved percentage points due largely to higher gold values 
future fluctuations in gold values would have an immediate and direct impact on the proceeds of scrapped jewelry 
in response to these fluctuations  the company may adjust the amount it lends on jewelry  which would ultimately impact the cost of inventory sold and sales margins 
inventory shrinkage  included in cost of goods sold  was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal at september   the company offered payday loans in locations and a call center 
this is an increase from september   when the company offered payday loans in locations and a call center 
during fiscal and  respectively  the company opened four and mono line stores specializing in payday loans

shared costs at adjoined mono line stores  such as rent and manager labor  have been excluded from these figures  as they did not increase with the build out of adjoined stores 
payday loan service charge revenue increased from fiscal primarily due to higher average loan balances at existing stores and the addition of new mono line stores 
payday loan bad debt also increased million in fiscal approximately of the increase in bad debt was related to the higher average loan balances  while was caused by the increase in the net default rate from to of loans made and renewed during the year 
slightly offsetting the increase in bad debt was a million reduction in other payday loan direct transaction expenses 
the company provides a valuation allowance on payday loan principal and fees receivable 
due to the short term nature of these loans  the company uses recent net default rates and anticipated seasonal changes in the default rate as the basis for its valuation allowance 
at september   the valuation allowance was of payday loan principal and fees receivable 
store operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing a percentage point decrease when measured as a percent of net revenue 
of the total million increase  million related to new mono line stores 
the remaining million increase was largely due to a million increase in labor and labor related costs and a million increase in facility repairs and maintenance 
administrative expenses were million of net revenue in fiscal compared to million of net revenue in fiscal the million increase is due primarily to million in restricted stock grants and related taxes  a million increase in legal and professional fees  and a million increase in incentive compensation related to the company s improved performance 
also contributing to the increase was the impairment of a million note receivable from a former chief executive officer of the company due to its doubtful collection 
included in administrative expenses are management fees and expense reimbursements for a related party totaling  and  in fiscal and  as more fully discussed in item of this report 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in fiscal to million  primarily due to the net effect of assets that became fully depreciated versus assets placed in service during the year 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased to million from million in fiscal the improvement resulted from lower average debt balances and lower effective interest rates 
at september   the company s total debt was million compared to million at september  decreases in the debt balance were funded by cash flow from operations after funding all investment activity 
in fiscal  the company invested million in an internet related start up company 
based on the investee s performance  the company determined at september  that its investment was fully impaired  and recorded a million impairment charge in fiscal fiscal had no similar impairment 
the fiscal income tax expense was million  or of pre tax income  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the fiscal benefit includes the reversal of a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance as the company projected during that period that its future taxable income would be sufficient to fully realize its deferred tax asset 
excluding the reversal of the valuation allowance  the company s fiscal income tax provision would have been million  or of pre tax income 
the increase in the fiscal effective tax rate is due to an increase in non deductible executive compensation and an increase in state income taxes 
operating income for fiscal improved million over fiscal to million 
the million improvement in gross profit on sales and million increased contribution from payday loans account for most of the improvement 
coupled with these are a million increase in same store pawn service charges and a million reduction in depreciation expense 
these improvements were partially offset by the million increase in administrative expenses and million increase in same store operating expenses 
after a million improvement in interest expense  the absence of a million investment impairment as was seen in fiscal  and other smaller items  income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
improved to million from million in fiscal after the changes in income taxes and the fiscal cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 net income improved from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the company s fiscal pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from fiscal to million 
this represents an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million offset by the decrease in pawn service charge revenue from closed stores million 
the improvement in same store pawn service charge revenue was due to a three percentage point improvement in loan yields to in fiscal variations in the annualized loan yield are due generally to changes in the statutory fees that can be charged  changes in the level of loan forfeitures and a mix shift between loans with different yields 
excluding the effect of closed stores  the company s fiscal average balance of pawn loans outstanding was higher and ending pawn loans outstanding were lower than in fiscal fiscal sales increased million from fiscal to million

margins on merchandise sales decreased percentage points as a result of higher loan values on forfeited collateral  more aggressive discounting  and a higher inventory valuation allowance  primarily on aged general merchandise 
jewelry scrapping margins improved percentage points due largely to higher gold values 
future fluctuations in gold values would have an immediate and direct impact on the proceeds of scrapped jewelry 
in response to these fluctuations  the company may adjust the amount it lends on jewelry  which would ultimately impact the cost of inventory sold and sales margins 
inventory shrinkage  included in cost of goods sold  was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal during  the company offered payday loans in of its pawnshop locations and through its austin  texas based call center

payday loan service charge revenue and bad debt expense each increased from fiscal primarily due to higher average loan balances 
the loan balance increased primarily due to the maturing of the product 
the company s significant improvement in net defaults was primarily due to continued refinements in the company s collection efforts and improvements to its underwriting criteria as it gains more experience with this product 
the company provides a valuation allowance on payday loan principal and fees receivable 
due to the short term nature of these loans  the company uses recent net default rates and anticipated seasonal changes in the default rate as the basis for its valuation allowance 
at september   the valuation allowance was of payday loan principal and fees receivable 
in fiscal  store operating expenses increased to million from million in fiscal  representing a percentage point increase when measured as a percent of net revenues 
this increase is largely due to a million increase in labor and labor related costs and a million increase in robberies related primarily to one gang that was apprehended 
fiscal operating expenses also reflect million higher rent on computer equipment upgrades  and a million increase in rent from the sale leaseback of previously owned store locations 
the incremental sale leaseback rent expense was largely offset by related decreases in depreciation of the sold locations and lower interest expense from debt retired with the proceeds of the sale leaseback transactions 
administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million  of a percentage point higher than fiscal when measured as a percent of net revenue 
the increase is due primarily to higher employment related costs and payday loan related costs 
employment cost increases include benefit costs  general inflation  limited staff additions  and greater incentive compensation related to the company s improved overall performance in fiscal the increased volume of payday loans in fiscal required the increase in payday loan related costs  primarily labor in the debt collection area 
included in administrative expenses are management fees and expense reimbursements paid to a related party totaling  and  in fiscal and  as more fully discussed in item of this annual report on form k 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in fiscal to million

excluding the removal of the valuation allowance  the company s income tax provision would have been million of pretax income compared to an income tax provision of million of pretax income for fiscal the decrease in effective tax rate for fiscal is due to non deductible items having a smaller percentage impact on pretax earnings 
operating income for fiscal increased million over fiscal to million 
the million incremental contribution from payday loans  million improvement in gross profit on sales  and million increase in same store pawn service charges account for most of the improvement 
coupled with these is a million reduction in amortization resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and a million reduction in depreciation expense related to the sale leaseback of store locations 
these improvements were partially offset by million higher operating and administrative expenses and million of rent from the sale leaseback of store locations 
income before the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
improved to million from million in fiscal this resulted principally from a million decrease in interest expense  and a million reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  partially offset by a million impairment of an investment 
after the non cash cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 the company s net income was million compared to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the company s million cash flow from operations consisted of i net income plus several non cash items  aggregating to million  and ii million of changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts payable  accrued expenses  and federal income taxes 
in fiscal  the company s million cash flow from operations consisted of i net income plus several non cash items  aggregating to million and ii million of changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily prepaid expenses and other assets

the long term debt obligations included in the table above is the balance outstanding on the company s revolving credit agreement at september  the outstanding balance fluctuates based on cash needs and the interest rate varies in response to the company s leverage ratio 
for purposes of the this table  the company assumed the current outstanding balance and interest rate will be applicable through the maturity date of the credit agreement on april  the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund its contractual obligations  planned store growth  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements during the coming year 
seasonality historically  service charge revenues are highest in the company s first fiscal quarter october through december due to improving loan redemption rates coupled with a higher average loan balance following the summer lending season 
sales generally are highest in the company s first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and the impact of tax refunds 
sales volume can be heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory  which generally occurs during low jewelry sales periods may through october 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
the company s cash flow is greatest in its second fiscal quarter primarily due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season

risk factors changes in customer demand for the company s products and services could result in a significant decrease in revenues 
although the company s customer base commonly uses its products and services  the company s failure to meet changing demands of its customers could result in a significant decrease in its revenues 
changes in governmental rules and regulations applicable to the specialty financial services industry could have a negative impact on the company s lending activities 
the company s lending is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing requirements under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations 
new laws and regulations could be enacted that could have a negative impact on the company s lending activities 
much of the company s payday loan activity is concentrated with county bank  and changes in its relationship with county bank could have a material adverse impact on its lending activities and revenues 
the company markets and services payday loans for county bank  which is subject to fdic guidelines 
if county bank altered or discontinued its relationship with the company for any reason or if the company were unable to attract and retain customers for county bank  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results 
the failure of county bank to provide its service or to maintain the quality and consistency of its service or loan underwriting practices also could result in a material loss of customers  a related loss in revenue  or a significant increase in bad debt from those services 
achievement of the company s planned financial results is dependent upon its ability to open and acquire planned new stores 
the company s expansion program is subject to numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled  such as identifying acceptable locations or attractive acquisition targets and the company s ability to attract  train and retain qualified store managers 
changes in the expected returns from new stores could also significantly affect the company s ability to achieve its planned financial results 
changes in payday loan default and collection rates could significantly decrease the company s planned earnings 
the profitability of payday loans is highly dependent upon the company s ability to manage the default rate and collect defaulted loans 
changes in its default or collection rates could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
additionally  the accuracy of the company s allowance for uncollectible payday loans is dependent upon several factors  including its ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
fluctuations in the company s inventory and pawn loan balances  inventory turnover and sales margins  and average yields on loan portfolios or pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s lending and retail operations 
the company regularly experiences fluctuations in its inventory and pawn loan balances  inventory turnover and sales margins  yields on loan portfolios and pawn redemption rates 
changes in any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the company s profitability and ability to achieve its planned results 
changes in the company s liquidity and capital requirements could limit its ability to achieve its plans 
the company requires continued access to capital  and a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its planned growth and operating results 
similarly  if actual costs to build new stores significantly exceed planned costs  this could materially restrict the company s ability to build new stores or to operate new stores profitably 
the company s credit agreement also limits the allowable amount of capital expenditures in any given fiscal year  which could limit the company s ability to build all planned new stores 
changes in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to achieve its plans 
the company encounters significant competition in connection with its lending and retail operations from other pawnshops  cash advance companies and other forms of financial institutions and other retailers  many of which have significantly greater financial resources than the company 
significant increases in these competitive influences could adversely affect the company s operations through a decrease in the number or quality of payday loans and pawn loans or the company s ability to liquidate forfeited collateral at acceptable margins 
the company s earnings could be negatively impacted by an unfavorable outcome of litigation  regulatory actions  or labor and employment matters 
from time to time  the company is involved in litigation  regulatory actions and labor and employment matters arising from its normal operations 
the company is currently a defendant in several actions  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts 
although the company believes the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operation or liquidity  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these actions 
a failure in the company s information systems could prevent it from effectively managing and controlling its business or serving its customers
