overview we develop  acquire and operate practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   we owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers 
the following table presents the changes in the number of surgery centers in operation  under development and under letter of intent for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a limited partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of the year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers disposed centers in operation  end of the year centers under development  end of the year development centers awaiting con approval  end of year average number of centers in operation  during year centers under letter of intent  end of year in  we closed a center upon the expiration of its real estate lease 
this center operated in conjunction with a center that will continue in operation and is owned by the same limited liability company 
in  we sold our interests in two surgery centers for their approximate book value 
of the surgery centers in operation as of december   centers perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  centers perform ophthalmology surgery procedures  four centers perform orthopedic procedures and five centers perform procedures in more than one specialty 
the other partner or member in each limited partnership or limited liability company is generally an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
we intend to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties and through future same center growth 
our growth targets for include the acquisition or development of a net to additional surgery centers and the achievement of same center revenue growth of to 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while we generally own of the entities that own the surgery centers  and up to in certain instances  our consolidated statements of operations include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center entities 
sources of revenues substantially all of our revenues are derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed in our surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly by the physicians 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers  such as those in which we own a majority interest  depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
the amount of payment a surgery center receives for its services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors  as well as other factors over which we have no control  including medicare and medicaid regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third party payors 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs  primarily medicare 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers in accordance with predetermined fee schedules 
on october  and october   our surgery centers received a and price increase  respectively  from medicare 
however  in we anticipate our surgery centers will receive a price decrease from medicare effective april  critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amsurg and our subsidiaries and the majority owned limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which we are the general partner or majority member 
consolidation of such limited partnerships and limited liability companies is necessary  as we have or more of the financial interest  are the general partner or majority member with all the duties  rights and responsibilities thereof and are responsible for the day to day management of the limited partnership or limited liability company  and have control of the entities 
the limited partner or minority member responsibilities are to supervise the delivery of medical services  with their rights being restricted to those that protect their financial interests  such as approval of the acquisition of significant assets or the incurrence of debt which they  as physician limited partners or members  are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests 
intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we operate in one reportable business segment  the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers 
revenue recognition 
center revenues consist of billing for the use of the centers facilities  or facility fees  directly to the patient or third party payor  and in limited instances  billing for anesthesia services 
such revenues are recognized when the related surgical procedures are performed 
revenues exclude any amounts billed for physicians surgical services  which are billed separately by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors  which we estimate based on historical trends of the surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  contracts with payors and procedure statistics 
in addition  we must estimate allowances for bad debt expense using similar information and analysis 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued expense are adequate  if the actual contractual adjustments and write offs are in excess of our estimates  our results of operations may be overstated 
at december  and  net accounts receivable reflected allowances for contractual adjustments of million and million  respectively  and allowances for bad debt expense of million and million  respectively 
goodwill 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require all business combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method 
sfas no 
requires that  upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will cease and instead  the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will be evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis  impairment of carrying value will be evaluated more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
identifiable intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period and reviewed for impairment 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june   which were subject immediately to the nonamortization provisions of this statement 
we fully adopted sfas no 
on january   and accordingly  ceased to amortize goodwill  which previously had been amortized over years 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component  with the fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
we have determined that we have one operating as well as one reportable segment 
our centers each qualify as components of that operating segment and have similar economic characteristics  and therefore  should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test and have determined that no potential impairment exists 
we completed our annual impairment test as required by sfas as of december   and have determined that it is not necessary to recognize impairment in our goodwill 
purchase price allocation 
we allocate the respective purchase price of our acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
the allocation of purchase price involves first  determining the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
secondly  the excess amount of purchase price is to be allocated to unidentifiable intangible assets goodwill 
a significant portion of each surgery center s purchase price historically has been allocated to goodwill due to the nature of the businesses acquired  the pricing and structure of our acquisitions and the absence of other factors indicating any significant value which could be attributable to separately identifiable intangible assets 
our resulting goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
as described above  is no longer amortized  but will be tested for impairment at least annually 
results of operations our revenues are directly related to the number of procedures our surgery centers perform 
our overall growth in procedure volume is impacted directly by the increase in the number of surgery centers in operation and the growth in procedure volume at existing centers 
we increase our number of surgery centers through both acquisitions and developments 
procedure growth at any existing center may result from additional contracts entered into with third party payors  increased market share of the associated medical practice of our physician partners  new physician partners and or scheduling and operating efficiencies gained at the surgery center 
a significant measurement of how much our revenues grow from year to year for existing centers is our same center revenue percentage 
we define our same center group each year as those centers which contain full year to date operations in both comparable reporting periods 
in  we had centers in our same center group and they had revenue growth of 
while historically our quarter to quarter and year to year same center revenue percentages have varied from to  we believe that our same center revenues in will range between and 
this projected growth rate reflects the anticipated reimbursement decrease from medicare in april see sources of revenues as well as reduced same center procedure growth rates experienced in our industry during recent quarters 
our same center group in will be comprised of centers  which constitutes approximately of our total base of centers 
expenses directly related to such procedures include clinical and administrative salaries and benefits  supply cost and other variable expenses such as linen cost  repair and maintenance of equipment  billing fees and bad debt expense 
the majority of our corporate salary and benefits cost is associated directly with the number of centers we 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued own and manage and tends to grow in proportion to the growth of our centers in operation 
our centers and corporate offices also incur costs that are more fixed in nature  such as lease expense  legal fees  property taxes  utilities and depreciation and amortization 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
our interest expense results primarily from our borrowings used to fund acquisition and development activity  as well as interest incurred on capital leases 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and numerous state income tax returns with varying tax rates 
our income tax expense reflects the blending of these rates 
the following table shows certain statement of earnings items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits supply cost other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income minority interest interest expense  net of interest income earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the following three factors nine additional surgery centers in operation at year end  with an average number of centers in operation throughout the year of in compared to in  primarily resulting from acquisitions  same center revenue growth of  resulting primarily from procedure growth centers included in the same center group  and modest price increases from medicare and private payors in over the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over in order to appropriately staff our surgery centers for these additional procedures  as well as provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers in operation  salaries and benefits increased proportionately by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume 
we also experienced modest cost savings due to favorable supply and drug buying programs in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation and additional corporate overhead 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation 
we anticipate further increases in operating expenses in  primarily due to additional start up centers and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation  as well as insurance cost and scheduled property rent increases at our existing centers 
typically  a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operations and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center until its case load grows to a more optimal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within the months after a center opens 
at december   we had centers under development and four centers that had been open for less than one year 
operating income margin increased by  which is primarily the result of the leverage we achieve from having a high but consistent fixed cost component from year to year at each center 
because each incremental procedure generates only a variable cost component  same center procedure growth generally contributes to operating income at a rate higher than the average operating income margin of the center 
minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest increased due to the fact that all of the acquired and developed centers in have a minority ownership  which continues to dilute the impact on minority interest of those existing centers that have less than minority ownership 
interest expense increased million in  or  from primarily due to additional long term debt outstanding during resulting primarily from acquisition activity and our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources 
we recognized income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was of earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
because we continue to deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the following two factors additional surgery centers in operation at year end  primarily resulting from acquisitions  with an average number of centers in operation throughout the year of in compared to in  and procedure growth resulting in same center revenue growth centers included in the same center group 
the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over in order to appropriately staff our surgery centers for these additional procedures  as well as provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers in operation  salaries and benefits increased proportionately by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase resulted primarily from additional procedure volume 
other operating expenses increased million to million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation and additional corporate overhead 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  in from  primarily due to the non amortization of goodwill starting in as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies goodwill 
operating income margin increased by  which is primarily the result of the elimination of goodwill as described above  as well as the leverage we achieve from having a high but consistent fixed cost component from year to year at each center 
minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest increased due to the fact that our minority partners participate in the increased profitability of our centers 
additionally  all of the acquired and developed centers in have a minority ownership  which diluted the impact on minority interest of those existing centers that have less than minority ownership 
interest expense decreased million in  or  from prior to april  our debt level had grown to approximately million  primarily due to acquisition related borrowings 
however  net proceeds from our public offering  as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  were used to repay a significant portion of our outstanding debt 
additionally  we experienced lower interest rates in than in we recognized income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was of earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
because we continue to deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow activity resulted primarily from an additional million in net earnings  resulting primarily from additional centers in operation and growth in same center revenue  offset by increases in our accounts receivable and income taxes paid 
between december  and  we experienced a significant reduction in our average days in accounts receivable from to  which contributed to additional operating cash flow in at december   our days in accounts receivable was  consistent with days in accounts receivable at december  operating cash flow in also contained an additional million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options received in cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
during  we had total capital expenditures of million  which included million for acquisitions of interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers  including million in notes payable  which were repaid in  million for new or replacement property at existing surgery centers  and for new start up surgery centers 
our cash flow from operations was enough to fund our acquisition cash obligations and development activity  and we received approximately million from capital contributions of our minority partners to fund their proportionate share of development activity 
at december   we and our limited partnerships and limited liability companies had unfunded construction and equipment purchase commitments for centers under development or under renovation of approximately million  which we intend to fund through additional borrowings of long term debt  operating cash flow and capital contributions by minority partners 
during  we had net borrowings on long term debt of million 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which  as amended in march  permits us to borrow up 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to million to finance our acquisition and development projects and stock repurchase program at a rate equal to  at our option  the prime rate or libor plus a spread of to  depending upon borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also provides for a fee of to of unused commitments 
the loan agreement prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants at december  borrowings under the credit facility are due in march and are secured primarily by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our limited partnerships and our membership interests in the limited liability companies 
we incurred approximately  in deferred financing fees during  primarily associated with our credit facility 
during  we received approximately million from the exercise of options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans 
the tax benefit received from the exercise of those options was approximately million 
in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that allows us to purchase up to million of our common stock through august we currently have purchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million under this program  which was funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facility 
the following schedule summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases construction in progress commitments other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations our long term debt may increase based on acquisition activity expected to occur in the future and our stock repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
we may use our operating cash flow to repay existing long term debt under our credit facility prior to its maturity date 
other long term obligations consist of purchase price commitments that are contingent upon certain events 
in addition  as of december   we have available under our revolving credit facility million for acquisition borrowings 
our credit facility matures on march  foregoing any significant adverse impact on our future operating results  we believe that our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will provide us with adequate liquidity for the next three to five years to conduct our business and further implement our growth strategy
