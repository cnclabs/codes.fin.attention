table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general viasat was incorporated in and completed its initial public offering in we are a leading provider of advanced digital satellite communications and other wireless networking and signal processing equipment and services to the government and commercial markets 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the global satellite communications equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for the us government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications products incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
our company is organized principally in two segments government and commercial 
our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes tactical data links  including mids  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  government broadband products and services  which provide innovative solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity  and simulation and test equipment  which allows the testing of sophisticated airborne radio equipment without expensive flight exercises 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
we have been increasing our focus in recent years on offering satellite based communications products and systems solutions to address commercial market needs 
in pursuing this strategy  we have acquired three strategic satellite communication equipment providers the satellite networks business of scientific atlanta in fiscal year  comsat laboratories products business from lockheed martin in fiscal year  and us monolithics  llc in fiscal year our commercial business accounts for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year and of our revenues in fiscal year to date  our principal commercial offerings include very small aperture terminals vsats  broadband internet equipment over satellite  network control systems  network integration services  network operation services  gateway infrastructure  antenna systems and other satellite ground stations 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we won several important projects in the three key broadband markets enterprise  consumer and in flight mobile applications 
our commercial business offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs based technology  mobile broadband products and systems for in flight  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise vsat networks products and services  large antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers  satellite networking systems design and technology development  and mmic design and development  with an emphasis in systems engineering of packaged components  which specializes in high frequency communication technology design and development 

table of contents with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction  and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the unique ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating  and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target high technology satellite communication and other communication markets where the customer places a high priority on the solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining these awards 
generally  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion or based on the number of units delivered 
the company provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which they are first identified 
there were no significant charges for loss contracts in the last three years 
we also have contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  approximately for fiscal year  for fiscal year  and for fiscal year  of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a stipulated price 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the specific requirements of a customer s engineering and production order and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incurr independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year  of revenues during fiscal year  and of revenues during fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop and manufacture satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communications equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  viasat has been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support its business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to its competitors or peers 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
from through fiscal year  the company was profitable and grew its revenue base each year 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry and the terrorist attacks in resulted in the loss of approximately one third of our backlog at the end of calendar year in the ensuing months  viasat began rebuilding its backlog first in the government segment and then in the commercial segment 
while the company was rebuilding backlog  it was also investing significantly in research and development of new products and new business activities 
while awards in fiscal year were a record at the time  it was the first year the company did not grow its revenue on a year over year basis and was not profitable 

table of contents our growth in awards from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and to million in fiscal year became a leading indicator of revenue growth 
our revenues for fiscal year were million and with the awards growth and opportunities we are pursuing  we expect revenues for fiscal year to rise to around million 
there are a number of large new business opportunities we are pursuing in our fiscal year in the government segment  the opportunities include the mids lot v production order  international mids orders  new joint tactical radio system contracts  more funding for current information assurance projects  new information assurance contracts using our haipis technology  and orders for our new kg product 
in our commercial segment  the opportunities include new production orders for consumer and mobile broadband systems  further penetration in the north american market with enterprise vsat customers and large antenna systems 
the timing of these orders is not entirely predictable  so our revenue outlook may vary somewhat from quarter to quarter or even year to year 
our operating objective for income from operations  excluding the deduction for amortization of intangible assets  is ten percent of revenues 
to the extent we are not generating sufficient gross profit from revenues  we strive to adjust other operating expenses to achieve this objective 
due to the need to rebuild our backlog  to expand our product portfolio  the high level of customer funded research and development and our operating performance  we have not achieved this operating objective for the past three fiscal years  however as fiscal year progresses we expect to achieve the ten percent operating objective on a quarterly basis 
strengthening the quality of our balance sheet and generating positive cash flows from operating activities was a financial priority for us in fiscal years and and will continue to be a focus in fiscal year key areas the company monitors to achieve these objectives include monitoring program performance to ensure performance milestones are achieved  reducing the cycle time for amounts billed to customers and their related collection  and reducing inventory on hand 
in fiscal year  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations 
our capital needs will increase for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as we expand our facilities  production test equipment and lab development equipment needs to meet customer program requirements and growth forecasts 
our facility needs have normally been met with long term lease agreements  but we do anticipate additional tenant improvements over the next two fiscal years associated with our expansion 
additionally  as our employee base increases  the need for additional computers and other equipment will also increase 
included in this year s operating cash flow is million received from scientific atlanta and  in proceeds from the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million and a benefit to selling  general and administrative expenses of million as a result of scientific atlanta proceeds and a benefit to selling  general and administrative expenses of  from the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm see liquidity section of our md a for more detail 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
generally  we recognize revenues as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion or based on the number of units delivered 
historically  we have been able to make reliable estimates and have therefore been able to reasonably determine our percent complete 
however  many of our contracts involve the development of new technology and  as a result  the development of estimates underlying our percent complete is inherently subject to greater uncertainty 
even with our experience in estimating contract costs it is possible that our actual results could ultimately differ from our estimates  or that estimates could change as we make progress on a contract 
either 
table of contents of these potential outcomes would result in adjustments to the revenues and profits recorded on a contract 
from time to time we have recorded such changes in estimate 
it is also possible that adjusted estimates could indicate we will incur a loss on a contract 
we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which they are first identified 
there were no significant charges for loss contracts in the last three years 
we also have contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
capitalized software development costs we charge costs of developing software for sale to research and development expense when incurred  until technological feasibility has been established 
software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
once the product is available for general release  we amortize the software development costs based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product not to exceed five years 
the determination of net realizable value involves judgment and estimates of future revenues to be derived from a product  as well as estimates of future costs of manufacturing that product 
we use our experience in the marketplace in making judgments in estimating net realizable value  but our estimates may differ from the actual outcome 
we periodically assess the assumptions underlying our estimates and  if necessary  we would adjust the carrying amount of capitalized software development costs downward to our new estimate of net realizable value 
we did not capitalize any costs related to software developed for resale in the fiscal year ended april  we capitalized costs related to software developed for resale of million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  amortization expense of software development costs was million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and  for fiscal year these software development costs are part of other assets on the balance sheet and we record the related amortization expense as a charge to cost of revenues on the statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales have been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers are making up a larger part of our revenues 
except for orbcomm global  lp  we have experienced a good collection record from our commercial customers 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for more information on orbcomm 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  allowance for warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on certain of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
we classify the amounts we expect to incur within twelve months as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
impairment of goodwill we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for 
table of contents goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on april  in accordance with sfas no 
 we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets is less than its carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairments 
income tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance as of year end 
realization of our net deferred tax assets as of april  depends on our ability to generate sufficient future income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets based on forecasted income 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income

table of contents gross profit 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease gross profit percentage of revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the margin dollars generated from higher revenues and improved program performance in our enterprise vsat networks contracts over fiscal year these increases were partially offset by gross profit reductions from a higher percentage of customer funded products in the development stage for fiscal year  which typically have lower profit margins  cost overruns in our surfbeam product area and higher amortization of capitalized software 
our fiscal year gross profit includes a million benefit from the sa settlement and fiscal year included a million charge related to astrolink

sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development  marketing and sales  bid and proposal  finance  contract administration and general management 
some sg a expenses are difficult to predict and vary based on specific government and commercial sales opportunities 
independent research and development 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease independent research and development percentage of revenues the decrease in independent research and development ir d expenses reflects the reduced efforts for company funded development projects due to the increase of orders over the past months  where customer funded development was part of the contract 
amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from acquisitions in fiscal year and in fiscal year are being amortized over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
the estimated amortization expense of long lived intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease resulted from lower outstanding borrowings coupled with lower loan fees in fiscal year at march   there were million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
at april   there were no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year this decrease resulted from lower average invested cash balances and lower yields 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was a provision of in fiscal year compared to a benefit of in fiscal year we generate research and development credits that are not variable to income  so when there is a loss before tax as it was in fiscal year  the credits increase the tax benefit 
in fiscal year  we have income before tax so the tax credits reduce the tax provision 
therefore  the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year cannot be meaningfully compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year our segment results fiscal year compared to fiscal year government segment revenues 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease revenues the increase in revenues related primarily to the million in awards received during fiscal year we experienced growth across all of our government products including tactical data links  mobile satellite systems and secure networking products 
segment operating profit 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease segment operating profit percentage of segment revenues the increase in segment operating profit dollars was primarily related to the increased revenue year over year 
segment operating profit did not increase as rapidly as revenues primarily due to higher customer funded research and development contract activity  which typically has a lower profit rate  and increased investments by us in our kg product 
commercial segment revenues 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages april  march  decrease decrease revenues the increase in revenues reflects improved competitive positioning across all our commercial products  more favorable market conditions in the commercial telecommunications market for our vsat network products  record awards for our large antenna products  and the further development of our in flight and consumer satellite broadband internet systems 
segment operating profit

our fiscal year segment operating profit includes a million benefit from the sa settlement and  in proceeds from the bankruptcy liquidation of orbcomm 
fiscal year segment operating profits included million of company funded research and development by usm  a january acquisition  the million charge related to astrolink and increased legal costs related to the claim against sa 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues

gross profit 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages march  march  decrease decrease gross profit percentage of revenues the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower sales and related margin  earnings charges from contract overruns on fixed price product development contracts  lower gross profit yielded on certain enterprise vsat network contracts  and a million charge related to astrolink 
these decreases were partially offset by the margin produced by higher sales volume in our government products and higher margins experienced in both the government and enterprise vsat network products related to manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses

excluding the charge relating to orbcomm  sg a expenses increased from million of revenues for fiscal year to million of revenues for fiscal year the increase was primarily related to higher bid and proposal costs to pursue and secure new business  and an increase in legal costs related to the claim against scientific atlanta  partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expenses 
sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development  marketing and sales  bid and proposal  finance  contract administration and general management 
some sg a expenses are difficult to predict and vary based on specific government and commercial sales opportunities 
independent research and development 
years ended dollar percentage increase increase in millions  except percentages march  march  decrease decrease independent research and development percentage of revenues the increase in ir d was primarily due to reduced customer funded product research and development and delays in certain program awards  which resulted in continued development under our funding 
in addition  usm s current products are primarily in the development phase and we included a full twelve months of expenses of million for these products in our fiscal year results versus only one quarter of expenses of million that we included in our fiscal results 
acquired in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development ipr d charge resulted from the acquisition of comsat laboratories and accounted for million of revenues for fiscal year an independent valuation was performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the purchased ipr d projects and other intangibles 
projects were identified in which there were research and development efforts underway where technological feasibility had not been reached 
at the time of the acquisition  comsat laboratories was developing a satellite network terminal that expands the frequencies on which an existing terminal could operate 
the date when the project was expected to reach technological feasibility at the 
table of contents time of the acquisition was september we estimated based on man hours incurred versus man hours required to complete the project that at the acquisition date the project was complete and would require approximately  to complete 
using the income approach  the value calculated for the ipr d associated with the satellite network terminal was million 
the project has proceeded since the acquisition and is now in production 
amortization of intangible assets 
we accounted for the acquisition of the satellite networks business from sa in fiscal year and comsat laboratories and usm in fiscal year by the purchase method of accounting 
we acquired comsat laboratories and usm after june  and they were accounted for under sfas therefore  the goodwill of those two acquisitions has not been subject to amortization 
we amortize the intangible assets over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in amortization was due to a full year of amortization in fiscal year from the fiscal year acquisitions 
the amortization of intangible assets will now decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the increase resulted from higher outstanding borrowings coupled with higher loan fees in fiscal year at march   there were million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
at march   there were million in outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year this decrease resulted from lower average invested cash balances and lower yields 
equity in loss of joint venture 
equity in loss of joint venture was  in fiscal year this was related to the loss from us monolithics for the period where viasat did not maintain a controlling ownership interest 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was a benefit in fiscal year compared to a benefit of in fiscal year we generate research and development credits that are not variable to income  so when the income or loss before tax is close to zero as it was in fiscal year  the tax provision benefit percentage will be impacted to a high degree by the credits 
therefore  the annual effective tax rate for fiscal year cannot be meaningfully compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal year our segment results fiscal year compared to fiscal year government segment revenues

fiscal year included million for the write off of receivables related to orbcomm 
backlog as of april   we had firm backlog of million  of which million was funded 
this compares to firm backlog of million at march   of which million was funded  not including options of million 
of the million in firm backlog at april   approximately million we expect to deliver in fiscal year and the balance of approximately million we expect to deliver in fiscal year and thereafter 
total new awards for both commercial and defense products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
as of april   our firm backlog does not include contract options of million 
these options include million of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts for our uhf dama satellite communications products and million of idiq contracts for our other products 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts
