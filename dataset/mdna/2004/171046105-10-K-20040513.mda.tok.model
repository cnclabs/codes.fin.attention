critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
as a result  actual results could differ because of the use of these estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition sales are recognized by the company at the point of purchase when the customer takes possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase  generally with cash or credit card 
sales from purchases made with gift certificates or gift cards are also recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
gift certificates and gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed 
the company has established an allowance for sales returns by customers 
this allowance has been calculated using estimates based on historical experience that management believes to be reasonable 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out retail inventory method 
permanent markdowns of inventory are recorded monthly based on an evaluation by merchandising management  which includes analyzing inventory levels and aging  as well as rate of sale 
the company further reduces the value of inventory by recording an allowance for permanent markdowns based on inventory levels from the season which immediately precedes the current season as of the reporting date 
permanent markdowns on this merchandise take into account the future anticipated selling price of the inventory 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s gross margins and adversely affect its financial position and results of operations 
for the fiscal years ended february   march  and march   permanent inventory markdowns totaled   and  respectively 
property  equipment and improvements property  equipment and improvements are stated at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life  three to five years for computer hardware and software  seven years for furniture  fixtures and other equipment  and years for the company s corporate office and distribution center and related building improvements 
store leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related leases  which is typically ten years 
repairs and maintenance which do not extend an asset s useful life are expensed as incurred 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income or expense for that period 
the company reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the net book value of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the impairment loss to be recorded would be the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value 
fair value would be determined based upon the best information available under the circumstances including quoted prices or other valuation techniques 
cost of sales cost of sales include the cost of merchandise  markdowns  shrink  freight in to and out from the company s distribution center  buyer and distribution center salaries  buyer travel  rent and other occupancy related costs  miscellaneous merchandise expenses and other costs related to the company s distribution network 
cost of sales excludes all depreciation and amortization expense 
the company s gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities as some entities  such as the company  include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  while other entities exclude a portion of these expenses from cost of sales and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include all salaries with the exception of buyer and distribution center salaries  other employee benefits  advertising  store supplies  credit card processing fees  information technology related costs  insurance  professional services  non buyer travel and miscellaneous other selling and administrative related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses exclude all depreciation and amortization expense 
rent expense most of the company s lease agreements for retail space include escalation clauses in minimum base rent 
for leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rent  the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations 
in addition  the company has a limited number of other lease agreements for retail space which include escalation clauses in minimum rent based on increases in the consumer price index  not to exceed 
for purposes of calculating rent expense and future minimum lease payments  the company utilizes the maximum annual increase of

realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent upon future taxable income 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgements and interpretations of tax laws and published guidance with respect to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of net deferred tax assets will be realized

the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this form k 
certain additional business risk factors investors in the company should consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained herein 
need for optimal retail store locations the success of individual retail stores will depend to a great extent on locating them in desirable shopping venues in markets where the company s target customers shop 
the success of individual stores may depend on the success of the shopping malls or lifestyle centers in which they are located 
in addition  the demographic and other marketing data the company relies on in determining the location of its stores cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy 
as a result  retail stores the company opens may not be profitable or may be less successful than anticipated 
effective management of growth strategy the company s continued growth depends on its ability to open and operate stores successfully and to manage the company s planned expansion 
during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately new stores  of which approximately are expected to be christopher banks stores and approximately are expected to be cj banks stores 
the company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including locating suitable store sites  negotiating favorable lease terms  sourcing sufficient levels of inventory  hiring and training qualified management level and other employees and integrating new stores into its existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that such expansion will be profitable or that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively 
changing customer preferences the company s future success will depend on its ability to continually select the right merchandise assortment  maintain appropriate inventory levels and creatively present merchandise in a way that is appealing to its customers 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty  as they continually change and vary from region to region 
on average  the company begins the design process for its apparel six to seven months before merchandise is available to its customers and the company typically begins to make purchase commitments four to five months in advance 
these lead times make it difficult for the company to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences and amplify the consequences of any misjudgments it might make in anticipating customer preferences 
consequently  if the company misjudges its customers merchandise preferences or purchasing habits  its sales may decline significantly  and the company may be required to mark down certain products to significantly lower prices to sell excess inventory  which would result in lower margins 
fluctuations in comparable store sales results the company s comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect comparable store sales results  including changes in fashion trends  changes in the company s merchandise mix  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
past comparable store sales results are not an indicator of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales results will not decrease in the future 
the company s comparable store sales results are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
competition the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with national and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains and independent retail stores that market similar lines of merchandise 
many competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources and enjoy greater national  regional and local name recognition than does the company 
depth of selection in sizes  colors and styles of merchandise  merchandise procurement and pricing  ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences  inventory control  reputation  quality of merchandise  store design and location  brand recognition and customer service are all important factors in competing successfully in the retail industry 
the company s successful performance in recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other retailers 
such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail environment in which the company operates more competitive 
general economic conditions the company s business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences  which are dictated in part by fashion and season 
in addition  certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise offered by the company  including  among others  unemployment levels  business conditions  interest rates and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or change from time to time in each market in which the company operates and negatively affect the company s net sales and profitability 
reliance on key personnel the company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends to a significant extent both upon the performance of its current executive and senior management team and its ability to attract  hire  motivate and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future 
the company s inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel  or the loss of the services of any of its executive officers  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or management discussions concerning the company or its competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or monthly comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets  in general  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies
