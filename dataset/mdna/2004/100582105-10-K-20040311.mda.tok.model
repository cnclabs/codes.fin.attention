item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations we are a leading provider of real time subscriber management services to the wireless industry through a combination of proprietary software applications  a carrier class hosted environment  a voice resource network and a service and support organization 
with our solutions  wireless carriers can bring new services to market to meet the ever changing demands of the wireless subscriber 
our transaction processing solutions for real time wireless subscriber management  payment services and billing and customer care can be deployed separately or in combination  giving carriers maximum flexibility in how our solutions are integrated to legacy environments 
our solutions provide carriers with distinct competitive advantages by empowering them to attract  retain and maximize the value of subscribers  while lowering the cost associated with customer care  payment processing and churn 
we operate our billing and transaction processing services and roaming services businesses as a business process outsourcer  primarily in the united states 
our prepaid systems business sells turnkey systems primarily to international wireless carriers 
we sell our products and services to our wireless carrier customers through our direct sales force 
our total revenues increased to million in compared to million in the increase was attributable to a increase in our billing and transaction processing service business  partially offset by a decline in roaming service revenues and  to a lesser extent  to an decline in prepaid systems revenues 
in  total revenues increased to million compared to million in the increase was attributable to a increase in our billing and transaction processing service business  partially offset by a decline in roaming service revenues and  to a lesser extent  a decline in prepaid systems revenue 
our operating income of million in represents an increase from operating income of million in and an operating loss of  in the increase in billing and transaction processing service revenues and our corresponding predominantly fixed cost infrastructure were the principal drivers for our sequential year over year increases in operating income in and the specifics of each of our segments revenues and gross margin are discussed in greater detail below 
we anticipate that earnings per share for the first quarter of will approximate to  including approximately per share of legal costs  primarily associated with the freedom wireless lawsuit 
we have not provided guidance for the remainder of due to the uncertainty of our future relationship with verizon wireless 
on july   verizon wireless requested that we provide support services to assist them in testing their own internal prepaid platform in  which could potentially displace the prepaid solutions we currently provide verizon wireless 
our existing prepaid wireless services agreement with verizon wireless is in its auto renewal term and may be terminated by either party upon days written notice 
in an effort to mitigate the impact of this potential loss  we continue to pursue our strategy to diversify our revenue base by offering new and enhanced solutions  expanding relationships with existing customers and evaluating key acquisition opportunities 
our reportable operating segments consist of billing and transaction processing services  roaming services and prepaid systems 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for our operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which our management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
we principally evaluate performance based on the gross margin of each stand alone business 
segment disclosure information is included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that any impact from inflation is not material 
segment data in thousands except for percentages billing and transaction processing services roaming services prepaid systems total revenues gross margin gross margin percentage revenues gross margin gross margin percentage revenues gross margin gross margin percentage billing and transaction processing services billing and transaction processing services revenues increased to million in from million in and increased to million in from million in billing and transaction processing revenues increased in due to the increase in average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month to an average of for the full year ended december  compared to for the full year ended december  the higher billed minutes of use resulted primarily from our carrier customers promoting more full featured prepaid offerings  including sms  data services  ptt  enhanced handsets  etc 
in addition  the net increase in our subscriber base of  subscribers to million at december  from million at december  contributed to the revenue increase 
the increase in the subscriber base resulted from a full year of subscriber additions from nextel and alltel  who launched their prepaid offerings with us in the fourth quarter of and  to a lesser extent  the additional subscriber growth of our existing carrier customers who competitively promoted and enhanced their offerings 
these increases were offset by a decrease in our average billed rate per minute as carriers availed themselves of our volume pricing discounts 
the increase in revenues during resulted from an increase in average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month  resulting from an increase in the number of digital subscribers on our network and increased average usage as our carrier customers promoted more competitively priced and full featured prepaid solutions 
in addition  the increase in our subscriber base to million at december  from million at december  contributed to the revenue increase 
the increase in the subscriber base in resulted from the additional subscriber growth of our existing carrier customers  who competitively promoted and enhanced their offerings  and new carrier customers  who launched their prepaid offerings with us in  in addition to subscribers added from conversions by cingular wireless from markets that were previously served by our competitors platforms 
these increases were offset by a decrease in our average billed rate per minute as carriers availed themselves of our volume pricing discounts 
gross margins for billing and transaction processing services increased to of billing and transaction processing services revenues in from in and in the improvement in gross margins in each year resulted from the significant increases in billing and transaction processing service revenues that leveraged our predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
as we enhance our infrastructure to support our new solutions  including bcgi mobile guardian  and the additional markets that nextel plans to launch  we expect that gross margins for billing and transaction processing services will decrease to approximately to of related revenues in the first quarter of roaming services roaming services revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in the decrease in roaming services revenues in each year was primarily attributable to consolidation in the industry and advancements in handset technology that have improved registered roaming capabilities  reducing the need for this service 
gross margins for roaming services decreased to of roaming services revenues in from in and in the decreases resulted primarily from lower revenues and the resulting lower absorption of fixed costs 
as a result of the continued decline in roaming services  we will not continue to offer this service to our customers  and we expect that we will discontinue this business in the first half of we do not expect any material costs to be recorded related to the discontinuation 
prepaid systems prepaid systems revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in prepaid systems revenues decreased in both and due to a slight decrease in sales of prepaid systems to international customers 
gross margins for prepaid systems decreased to of prepaid systems revenues in compared to in and increased in from in the decrease in gross margins in compared to resulted primarily from decreases in both inter segment sales and sales to external customers 
the increase in gross margins in compared to primarily resulted from an increase in expansion sales to existing customers  which typically yield higher margins 
we currently price and sell all of our systems to international customers in us dollars 
all payments are received in us dollars  which minimizes our need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
operating data in thousands total of revenue total of revenue total of revenue total revenues engineering  research and development expense sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense general and administrative expense legal depreciation and amortization expense impairment of long lived assets engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development expenses primarily include the salaries and benefits for software development and engineering personnel associated with the development  implementation and maintenance of existing and new services 
engineering  research and development expenses were of total revenues in both and  and in the increase in absolute dollars in resulted from additional resources and wages to support the development of our new solutions and the expansion and enhancement of the features and functionality of our billing and transaction processing services business 
the increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in resulted from additional resources devoted to expanding and enhancing the features and functionality of our billing and transaction processing services business 
we intend to continue to increase our engineering  research and development expenditures to support ongoing and future development and enhancements of our new and existing solutions 
as a result of these factors  we expect engineering  research and development expenses to increase in the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  direct mail and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses remained consistent with at of revenues and increased in absolute dollars due to additional wages  partially a result of higher commissions  as well as the full year of expenses from the infotech acquisition and an increased investment in bcgi payment services 
sales and marketing expenses declined to of total revenues in from in this decrease resulted from leveraging our predominantly fixed costs as well as our success in effectively managing costs 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  as we invest in the marketing and promotion of our newest solutions  including bcgi mobile guardian 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide our administrative support 
total general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues for the year ended december  compared to in and the increase in absolute dollars in compared to was due to additional wages  a full year of expenses from the infotech acquisition and higher costs associated with enhanced regulatory requirements for public companies 
the decrease in percentage terms compared to was due to overall increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses legal charges general and administrative legal expenses totaled million in  million in and million in and were incurred primarily for legal expenses to defend the patent infringement suit initiated by freedom wireless 
these legal expenses are expected to approximate million per quarter until the freedom wireless matter is resolved 
however  costs may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of proceedings 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems and software  building  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to of total revenues in compared to in and in and in the increase in absolute dollars in compared to was due to more capital deployed to support growth and continued enhancements in billing and transaction processing services and  to a lesser extent  due to a full year of depreciation expense related to the purchase of our bedford  massachusetts facility and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the infotech acquisition 
the increase in compared to primarily resulted from additional equipment and software purchased and developed to support our growth 
we expect that depreciation and amortization will increase in as our purchases for platform improvements are placed in service in and to support the roll out of our new solutions  including bcgi mobile guardian 
impairment of long lived assets we recognized pre tax charges of  in related to the write down of hardware and software no longer used in our prepaid systems business due to the discontinuance of our voice mail system solution 
interest income  net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in and decreased in compared to million in interest income was earned primarily from investments  which were purchased using the cash generated from operations  from the sale of our teleservices business in and from the proceeds from our public offerings 
although our combined cash and investment positions increased throughout  lower average interest rates during the period resulted in decreased levels of interest income in compared to the decrease in interest income in was also due to lower interest rates in the marketplace 
other expense a non recurring charge of  for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the permanent impairment of a cost based investment 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the years ended december  and the income tax rate decreased in due to the utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards that had not been valued 
excluding this benefit recognized in  our tax rate approximates the statutory rate 
our income tax rate is expected to return to approximately in acquisition in october  we completed the acquisition of isc  a privately held provider of billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace  providing us with an outsourced postpaid billing service for wireless carriers 
we paid million in cash to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of isc 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill 
the fair values were determined by an independent appraiser and were based on fair values as of the date of acquisition 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of acquired technology and customer contracts and are being amortized over five years 
we accrued  at december  for cash consideration payable to isc based on qualified revenues earned in under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
this  was recorded as an increase to goodwill and is payable no later than march  we may be required to pay additional contingent cash consideration of up to million based on isc attaining certain defined annual revenue targets in and any additional cash consideration payments to isc will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the results of operations of isc are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of our operations for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   including such amounts expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
this quarterly information is unaudited  prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of our management  reflects all necessary adjustments  consisting of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented

the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  capitalized software and labor  long lived assets  goodwill and intangible asset impairment  legal expenses  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be our most critical policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in recognizing revenue  however  certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue  changes in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  changes in uncollectible or bad debt estimates  changes in mix  amount of international sales or delays in recognizing revenue  could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we recognize our revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and application of emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we earn billing and transaction processing services revenues in various ways  depending on the type of transaction 
for bcgi prepaid wireless  we earn revenues principally by processing prepaid wireless minutes  net of any penalties incurred related to outages on our platform 
for bcgi payment services  we earn revenues by processing transactions on behalf of wireless carriers subscribers 
for bcgi voyager billing and customer care  we earn revenues by generating a subscriber s monthly bill 
each of these revenues is recognized when the service is provided 
for license fees  special projects and implementation services  revenues are typically recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract with the carrier 
for multiple element arrangements  we determine the fair value of each element based on our specific objective evidence for that element and allocate total revenue from these arrangements to each element based on its fair value 
we earn roaming services revenues by processing wireless calls for unregistered wireless subscribers who have roamed outside of their service area 
roaming services revenues are recognized when the service is provided and are recorded net of unbillable amounts and amounts that are estimated to be uncollectible based on historical experience 
we believe that our estimates fairly represent the anticipated amounts to be disputed 
for our prepaid systems business  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of systems at the time the systems are shipped or delivered to the customer  depending on shipping terms 
in the event there are acceptance terms  we defer revenue until acceptance has occurred 
installation revenue is deferred until the entire installation is complete 
revenues from maintenance and support services are based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support contract period 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when the service is sold separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
in addition to recording revenues net of any penalties incurred related to outages on the prepaid platform and estimated amounts that may be disputed  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we record reserves based on the length of time the receivables are past due and on historical experience 
if circumstances change eg higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet their financial obligations  estimates of amounts recoverable could be adversely affected 
we believe that our allowance for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts fairly represents the potential amount of bad debt we could incur 
legal costs we accrue the costs of settlements  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable  otherwise  such costs are expensed as incurred 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are expensing legal costs related to the freedom wireless lawsuit as incurred due to the lengthy and unpredictable proceedings  which had made it difficult to reasonably estimate legal costs for the lawsuit 
research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of computer software or for the deployment of assets for internal use are capitalized 
the direct labor and payroll related costs of development of computer software  primarily for coding and testing of software  are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the direct labor  travel and payroll related costs to deploy assets for internal use are capitalized until the asset is placed in service 
we make judgments regarding the specific time that can be capitalized based upon the type of project and type of work being performed 
the capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on management s judgment  which contemplates the anticipated future undiscounted net cash flows and changes in hardware and software technologies 
internally capitalized costs totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the solution is made available for general release and amortization of internal use costs begins when the related asset is first placed into service 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which result in an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when indicators of impairment exist and the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets  other than goodwill  may not be recoverable  we compare the projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  which are determined considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and solution development cycles  to their carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and the carrying value is then compared to the asset s fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded immediately in the statement of operations 
fair value is determined by either a quoted market price or use of a present value technique  which requires judgments to be made by management regarding estimating future cash flows  economic life and discount rates  among other assumptions 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
for impairment tests of goodwill  we have determined that our goodwill is attributed to our billing and transaction processing services unit because this unit comprises the majority of our assets and revenues 
as such  we utilize the enterprise wide approach  which is based on the aggregate market value of our common stock  to determine the fair value our reporting segments and compare that to our consolidated net book value to determine if an impairment loss exists 
in october  we acquired infotech solutions corporation and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal asset acquired was completed technology of million related to billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace as well as customer contracts of  the fair value of these assets was determined by management  based in part upon information supplied by the management of the acquired business and a valuation analysis prepared by an independent appraiser 
the valuation of completed technology was primarily based on future cash flow projections over the estimated economic life adjusted for an incremental obsolescence rate discounted to present value 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology is five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits fas  revised 
fas  revised is meant to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
the standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and other relevant information 
in addition to providing enhanced annual disclosures  fas  revised also provides for enhanced quarterly disclosures of information related to pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
fas  revised applies to all fiscal periods ending after december  we have adopted the provisions of fas  revised  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by operations of million in resulted from million in net income  along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income taxes of million and the tax benefit from the exercises of stock options of million 
offsetting these increases was an overall increase in net operating assets of million  primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
our investing activities utilized million of net cash for the year ended december  we spent approximately million for the purchase and improvement of our new building  million for telecommunications systems equipment and software to expand and enhance our real time subscriber management network and billing and transaction processing platform and million for internally capitalized labor 
also  we purchased investments to fund our defined benefit plan  the balance of which totaled million as of december  in addition  we purchased million in short term investments  net of sales 
we anticipate that we will make capital investments of approximately to million in also  in addition to the  of cash consideration owed to isc for  we may pay additional contingent cash consideration of up to million through this contingency is based on isc attaining certain defined annual revenue targets in and we expect to contribute approximately million to fund our defined benefit plan assets in the second quarter of  and we intend to continue to make such contributions for the foreseeable future 
we intend to finance such investments or contingent consideration payments from short term investments or cash flow generated from operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million during due entirely to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the corresponding issuance of common stock 
we believe that our cash  short term investments and the funds we anticipate to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
we have non cancelable operating lease commitments for office space and equipment  many of which are renewable at our option as well as various other commitments for equipment and telecommunications services under which we are contractually obligated beyond the current period 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period total within year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not engage in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities  material trading activities in non exchange traded commodity contracts  or material transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with us 
certain factors that may affect future results the loss or significant reduction of business from one of our major customers  including verizon wireless or cingular wireless  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period has been attributable to a limited number of customers in the wireless telecommunications business 
this concentration of customers continues as verizon wireless represented and cingular wireless represented of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended december  verizon wireless and cingular wireless are expected to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
on july   verizon wireless requested that we provide support services to assist them in testing their own internal prepaid platform in  which could potentially displace the prepaid solutions we currently provide verizon wireless 
our existing prepaid wireless services agreement with verizon wireless is in its auto renewal term and may be terminated by either party upon days written notice 
if verizon wireless stops or materially reduces its usage of our prepaid wireless services for any reason  which may include verizon wireless providing its own prepaid services in house  our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
additionally  if verizon wireless were to renew its prepaid wireless services agreement with us  we expect their pricing and  therefore our revenues  would decrease 
we currently provide prepaid wireless solutions for cingular wireless s tdma markets and cingular wireless uses other vendors to provide prepaid wireless service in its existing gsm markets 
as cingular wireless expands the build out of its gsm network overlay  there is no guarantee that cingular wireless will not migrate its existing tdma prepaid business onto the gsm network or that we would be chosen as a supplier for prepaid solutions on cingular wireless gsm network 
if cingular wireless prepaid tdma customers migrate to gsm technology  our revenue from this tdma business would decrease 
our current contract with cingular wireless expires in the first half of not all of our customer contracts are exclusive 
therefore  our carrier customers have used and or tested and continue to use and or test their own services or services of our competitors in certain markets 
in addition  many of our contracts are up for renewal in and beyond 
if and when each of the contracts is renewed  some contractual rates may be lower than in previous years and at lower rates than we have estimated 
in addition  we depend on our wireless carrier customers to market and sell our solutions to consumers 
we can provide no assurance that they will do so successfully  and therefore  that there will be a significant market for prepaid programs  including our prepaid wireless solutions 
an unfavorable judgment in the freedom wireless lawsuit or any other lawsuit would have a material impact on our business 
in march  freedom wireless filed a suit against us and a number of wireless carriers claiming that we and the other defendants infringe a patent of freedom wireless 
in march  freedom wireless amended the complaint to include a continuation patent 
freedom wireless seeks injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
in addition  we are contractually obligated to indemnify the other defendants for any damages that they incur as a result of any infringement by our technology 
the suit is in the pre trial phase and various summary judgment motions have been filed by both parties in the case 
the court is expected to rule on these motions in the normal course of proceedings 
we cannot yet assess our potential liability  if any 
our failure to prevail in this matter would have any or all of the following material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations injunctive relief against us  which could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our business  an adverse judgment against us for significant monetary damages  a settlement on unfavorable terms  obligations to the other defendants to indemnify them for damages  obligations to customers for breach of a contractual warranty of non infringement  and or a requirement to reengineer our prepaid processing solution to avoid patent infringement  which would likely result in additional expense and delay 
regardless of the outcome  we will continue to incur significant expenses to defend this lawsuit 
we have incurred approximately million in legal costs as of december  to defend this lawsuit  and we expect to incur approximately million per quarter in legal costs until the freedom wireless matter is resolved 
however  this cost will likely continue to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the timing of proceedings 
moreover  this lawsuit may divert the efforts and attention of our management team from normal business operations 
finally  we may become subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits in the future 
if we experience outages in our network  we will be subject to financial penalties that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
each quarter  we have experienced network outages  some of which have resulted in significant reductions in revenue due to penalty clauses contained in certain of our carrier customer contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully support and enhance our real time subscriber management network and billing and transaction processing platform effectively or that our network will successfully support current and future growth 
any failure to successfully support current and future growth  or an increase in the frequency or duration of outages would reduce our revenue and damage our reputation 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect our systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  computer viruses or similar events 
although we have built redundancy into our network  providing for backup systems  equipment and telecommunications connections  there are still parts of the network that are not redundant at this time 
our bedford  massachusetts building is operational and currently performs nearly all significant processing functions of our network  but not all portions of the network have been made fully redundant at our bedford facility 
although the woburn facility is designed for redundancy  until our bedford facility becomes fully operational expected to be in the second quarter of  we will not have complete geographical redundancy 
when the bedford site does become fully operational  we still may not be protected from a natural disaster within the greater boston  massachusetts area 
our business would be materially adversely impacted if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology and our ability to protect such technology 
we have a number of patent applications pending to protect our proprietary technology in the united states and internationally 
if these patent applications are not approved  we may not be able to prevent others from using similar technologies and we may be subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits or royalty payments to use the technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property which may result in the loss of customers 
in addition  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success and could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions 
a key part of our growth and diversification strategy is to engage in acquisitions 
we regularly review future acquisition opportunities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify any appropriate acquisition candidates or that any identified acquisition opportunities will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things possible decreases in capital resources or dilution to existing stockholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and the services or products of the acquired company  difficulties of operating a new business  potential inherited liability for the past actions of the acquired company  risk that any acquired company s internal controls may not be adequate  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  limited ability to predict future operating results of the acquired company  and potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company 
in the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations  we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations or will have the intended financial or strategic results 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business  which would adversely impact our ability to offer competitive solutions and grow 
we have expanded our operations rapidly  creating significant demands on our management  administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
any additional expansion by us may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
inability of our management to manage operational changes effectively  would materially and adversely affect the quality of our solutions  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not continue to develop and offer more functionality and features in our solutions at competitive prices  including the new solutions currently in our pipeline  we will not be able to compete effectively and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business will not be successful if we do not develop and offer more functionality and features in our solutions than those available in competitive offerings or if we are unable to develop new solutions to offer our carrier customers 
in addition  we may be unable to leverage our existing infrastructure to provide enhancements to our current solutions or new solutions cost effectively 
if we cannot develop and provide more functionality and features than our competitors  if we cannot sell our new solutions to our customers  or if we are unable to keep our costs down to provide new and enhanced solutions  we would likely lose market share or be required to reduce our margins  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we do not continue to upgrade our software and hosting environment as new wireless technologies evolve  including but not limited to sim  g and g technologies  we may lose existing and prospective customers 
the market for our solutions is very competitive and depends on the growth and health of the wireless industry and wireless carriers 
we have historically provided our solutions almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
the market for solutions to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change as new technologies are continually introduced in the wireless marketplace 
we anticipate continued growth and competition in the wireless services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
our competitors include independent providers of prepaid and other solutions to wireless carriers and the wireless carriers themselves who provide  or can provide  in house services similar to ours 
these wireless carriers  and many of the independent service providers  have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  the wireless industry is subject to consolidation  which could potentially result in the loss of carrier customers and or subscribers 
competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and may require us to reduce the price of our service solutions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share  resulting in serious harm to our business and operating results 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us  which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business 
a class action lawsuit has been brought against us and two of our senior executives in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of our common stock between april  and july  inclusive 
the lawsuit claims violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder and seeks unspecified damages  attorneys fees and costs 
the lawsuit asserts  among other things  that during the alleged class period we failed to disclose material adverse information about our business  operations and future prospects 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this complaint 
any conclusion of this matter in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding could be substantial  even if such litigation or proceedings could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceeding could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate  which may result in significant fluctuations in our stock price 
we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue and could intensify 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including variations in volumes of minutes of use generated by our carrier customers subscribers  rates per minute paid by our customers  impact and acceptance of existing solutions or the introduction of competing solutions by wireless carriers  including those who are currently our prepaid wireless services customers  our carriers ability to generate additional prepaid subscribers using our solutions  extent of our carriers emphasis on promoting prepaid solutions and the timing of related marketing initiatives  including our carriers allocation of marketing resources for initiatives other than prepaid wireless services  such as wireless number portability  data services  new technologies  etc 
our and our carrier s ability to minimize churn the percentage of total prepaid subscribers that terminate service on our network  decreased demand for our prepaid systems  caused by reductions in capital budgets of our customers  changing technologies  and other reasons beyond our control  changes in the mix of solutions we provide  seasonal trends  particularly in the second and third quarters when carriers are not usually marketing and selling prepaid services as aggressively as in the first and fourth quarters of the year  consolidation within the wireless industry  which could lead to the loss of a major customer or the reduction in rates per minute paid by our customers  and number and significance of network outages in a particular quarter and the severity and timing of penalties that result from such outages 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter our results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
to provide our solutions  we depend on a number of third party software  hardware and service vendors and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we are unable or delayed in our ability to obtain these components and applications 
our operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors  sometimes licensed from single vendors 
there can be no assurance that these vendors will continue to license these components and applications to us or that they will do so at reasonable prices 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by us and our vendors 
if we cannot obtain these components and applications from our existing vendors  we may not be able to timely procure or develop replacement software and hardware at commercially reasonable costs  or at all 
if we are unable to do so  we may be required to delay the development or sale of our current or future solutions  which would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  mci formerly worldcom  inc  who currently provides certain telecommunications services to us  has filed for chapter bankruptcy 
although we have backup and redundancy plans in place  if there are any significant decreases in service levels  or if mci is no longer able to provide certain services to us  our business would suffer during the transition period to a replacement carrier 
changes in international economic conditions could harm our prepaid systems business 
we currently price and sell all of our prepaid systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many prepaid systems customers are multinational corporations 
we currently receive payments in us dollars in order to protect us from foreign currency fluctuations 
however  in the future  prepaid systems sales to foreign countries may result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions beyond our control 
changes in assumptions related to the expected discontinuation of our roaming services business could adversely affect our overall margins and the results of our operations 
we have announced that we are winding down the roaming services business with final shutdown anticipated to be completed in the first half of although there are no material costs expected to be recorded for the closure of this business  certain unforeseen contingencies could arise related to shut down which could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the loss of any key personnel could harm our prepaid systems business 
we depend on a limited number of personnel to sell prepaid systems 
failure to retain such personnel would impair our ability to effectively market and sell prepaid systems for at least several months while we properly train new personnel 
any delay in sales and marketing efforts due to such turnover  or failure of existing personnel to perform at an adequate level would materially and adversely affect the prepaid systems business 
changes in government regulations can adversely impact our business 
proposals to intensify or reduce government regulations of the wireless telephone industry continue to be discussed at both the federal and state levels 
such changes may decrease the growth of the wireless telephone industry  result in new competitors or industry consolidation  limit the number of potential customers for our solutions or impede our ability to offer competitive solutions to the wireless market or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  since our investments are generally conservative in nature and are of a relatively short duration and some are held to maturity  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for either hedging foreign currency exposure risk or speculative trading purposes 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
