item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  if semiconductor manufacturers fail to adopt simox technology during the current or subsequent process cycle such cycles typically last two to three years  widespread adoption of simox technology may never materialize  our technology may become obsolete and we may be required to recognize an additional material impairment loss in the future 
in addition  although we are aware of only one other company manufacturing oxygen implant equipment  other major semiconductor implant equipment manufacturers could develop a less expensive oxygen implanter with superior technology 
our ability to compete with other manufacturers of semiconductor implanters  simox wafers and manufacturers of competing soi wafers  as well as with bulk silicon  epitaxial  strained silicon and compound materials wafer manufacturers  will depend on numerous factors within and outside our control  including the success and timing of our product introductions and those of our competitors  product distribution  customer support  sufficiency of funding available to us  and the price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies 
we must continually improve existing products  design and sell new products and manage the costs of research and development in order to compete effectively 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and required customer specifications 
due to the constant changes in our markets  our future success depends on our ability to improve our manufacturing processes  improve existing products and develop new products 
for example  our oxygen implanters must remain competitive on the basis of cost of ownership  process performance and evolving customer needs 
to remain competitive we must continually introduce oxygen implanters with higher capacity  better production yields and the ability to process larger wafer sizes 
the commercialization of new products involves  among other requirements  substantial expenditures in research and development  production and marketing 
we may be unable to successfully design or manufacture these new products and may have difficulty penetrating new markets 
because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research  development and engineering objectives  actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended 
our business may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to improve our existing products on a timely basis  our new products are not introduced on a timely basis  we incur budget overruns or delays in our research and development efforts  or our new products experience reliability or quality problems 
our simox soi wafer products are difficult to manufacture and small manufacturing defects can adversely affect our customers and our own production yields and our operating results 
the manufacture of our simox soi wafers is a highly complex and precise process 
simox soi wafer production requires a tightly controlled  clean environment 
very small impurities in our manufacturing materials or process  contamination of the manufacturing environment and or equipment failures can cause wafers to be rejected  can adversely affect our customers manufacturing yields of their integrated circuits or can cause shipping delays 
we may experience problems in achieving an acceptable yield in the manufacture of simox soi wafers  and the risk of encountering difficulties increases as we transition to new manufacturing methods or more exacting customer specifications 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties in keeping pace with evolving customer specifications which have led to delayed simox soi wafer shipments and or increased production costs 
the customer qualification process for our wafer products is complex and lengthy 
our customers expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our wafer products before they place any orders with us 
to date  commercial shipments of our wafers have been used principally for evaluation purposes or pilot production in products by our customers 
the time to develop an integrated circuit on simox soi is lengthy  sometimes taking twelve to thirty six months 
the cycle typically goes from initial sampling of simox soi wafers to more intensive sampling  the manufacture of prototype integrated circuits  circuit process modifications  yield optimization  pilot production and finally  production 
this is a normal cycle in the semiconductor industry for any new advanced material such as ibis simox soi 
even after this lengthy qualification process  customers may not purchase our products in substantial amounts  or at all 
this lengthy sales cycle  as well as the practice of semiconductor manufacturers to place sporadic orders and their right to cancel orders prior to delivery  may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from period to period 
the sales cycle for our oxygen implanter equipment is lengthy and complex and we have only received limited orders for our oxygen implanter equipment 
our customers expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our implanters before they place orders with us 
since we began selling implanters in  we have only sold a total of eight ibis oxygen implanters at an average sale price of approximately million each and one i oxygen implanter at a selling price of approximately million 
the sales cycle typically goes from equipment demonstration  equipment specification negotiations  formal quotation  contract negotiations and receipt of order and could take up to one year or longer 
in addition  our potential equipment customers that would like to use the mld process  owned by ibm  to manufacture simox soi wafers using our implanters would be required to license this technology directly from ibm 
we believe two silicon wafer manufacturer have already licensed this technology from ibm and others have developed their own simox process 
our potential equipment customers may wish to secure this license prior to giving us an order for equipment and these negotiations between ibm and our customer are beyond our control and no assurances are given that our customers and ibm would come to terms acceptable to both parties in a timely manner  or at all 
this has caused delays in receiving an order from one customer and could cause delays with other customers in the future 
we do not expect to sell more than a limited number of implanters in the near future 
the sale of one implanter would generally represent a substantial portion of our annual revenue 
accordingly  the delay in the receipt of orders  manufacture or delivery of even one unit would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual results of operations 
the manufacturing and customer qualification process for our implanters is complex  lengthy and costly 
in the semiconductor industry customers regularly require equipment manufacturers to qualify the equipment at the customer s site 
the time required to customer qualify an implanter at a customer s site is very difficult to predict because the qualification process for each of our implanters is complex  lengthy and costly and varies depending on our customer s varying specifications 
the manufacturing and qualification process for each implanter requires us to construct and customer qualify the machine at our premises  disassemble the machine for transportation  and reassemble and requalify it at the customer s premises 
during this qualification period  we invest significant resources and dedicate substantial production and technical personnel to achieve acceptance of the implanter 
each customer will not accept the implanter until it has successfully produced wafers to exact specifications at the customer s premises 
even very small differences in the customer s environment or initially imperceptible changes that may occur to the implanter during the transportation to and reassembly of the implanter at the customer s site can cause a large percentage of wafers produced by the implanter to be rejected  which would delay the acceptance of the implanter by the customer 
historically  we have experienced delays in achieving customer acceptance 
delays or difficulties in our manufacturing and qualification process could increase manufacturing and warranty costs and adversely affect our relationships with our customers 
in addition  because we do not recognize revenue on the sale of an implanter until it is delivered and qualified by the customer  any delay in qualification would result in a delay in our ability to recognize revenue from the sale 
historically it has taken approximately nine to eighteen months to build  ship and obtain customer acceptance of our implanters 
our implanters and associated technology are subject to export regulations  which could prevent or delay the sale of such products in foreign countries 
certain technologies associated with our implanters are subject to export regulations administered by the us department of commerce 
accordingly  we may be required to secure us export licenses with respect to sales of implanters or transfers of technologies to end users in certain foreign countries 
this requirement could result in significant delays in  or the prevention of  sales of implanters or transfers of technology or other such technical data to customers in certain foreign countries 
for example  the sale of an ibis implanter and the corresponding transfer of technology to simgui required an export license which took approximately one year to secure 
there can be no assurance that if necessary  we will be able to secure such licenses in the future in a timely manner  or at all 
the loss of key members of our scientific and management staff could delay and may prevent the achievement of our research  development and business objectives 
our chief executive officer  martin j 
reid  and other current officers and key members of our scientific staff are responsible for areas such as product development and improvements  and process improvements research  which are important to our specialized scientific business 
the loss of  and failure to promptly replace  any member of this group could significantly delay and may prevent the achievement of our research  development and business objectives 
while we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer  under certain circumstances he may be able to terminate his employment with us 
furthermore  although our employees are subject to certain confidentiality and non competition obligations  our key personnel may terminate their employment at any time and may become employed by a competitor 
the current composition of ibis management and of its board of directors is subject to change and should not be unduly relied upon 
we may not be able to successfully produce our products on a large scale 
we have limited manufacturing experience and have only manufactured limited quantities of oxygen implanters and simox soi wafers for low volume production 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities  at acceptable costs 
we may not be able to make the transition to high volume commercial production successfully 
future production in commercial quantities may create technical and financial challenges for us 
any difficulty or delay in constructing additional implanters  if needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to use all of our existing or future manufacturing capacity at a profitable level 
at times we may have the capacity to produce more oxygen implantation machines than we have orders for at such times 
during such idle time we would continue to be responsible for the fixed costs of our facility and maintaining personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have also invested in two mm simox wafer production lines and a significant portion of our expenses are fixed 
if we do not need this capacity and capability for any of a variety of reasons  including inadequate demand  our existing capacity and capability could be in excess of our actual needs and our fixed costs per wafer produced will increase  which could adversely affect us 
we may not successfully form or maintain desirable strategic alliances 
we believe we will need to form or maintain alliances with strategic partners for the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of our products 
we may enter into these strategic alliances to satisfy customer demand and to address possible customer concerns regarding our being a sole source supplier 
the limited number of reliable sources of supply other than ibis may adversely affect or delay the integration of simox soi wafers in mainstream commercial applications 
we may not be successful in maintaining alliances or in forming and maintaining other alliances  including satisfying our contractual obligations with our strategic partners  and our partners may not devote adequate resources to manufacture  market and distribute these products successfully or may attempt to compete with us 
we may have difficulty obtaining the materials and components needed to produce our products 
ibis manufactures its oxygen implanters from standard components and from components manufactured in house or by other vendors according to our design specifications 
most raw materials and components not produced by us are available from more than one supplier 
however  certain raw materials  components and subassemblies are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
semiconductor equipment is a secular growth industry and is very cyclical in nature  so if our suppliers experience an increase in demand from other semiconductor equipment manufacturers with much higher volumes than us  the lead time and or price for some of our components may increase 
although we have sought to reduce our dependence on these limited source suppliers and we have not experienced significant production delays due to unavailability or delay in procurement of component parts or raw materials to date  increased market demand for materials from  or disruption or termination of  certain of these sources could occur and such increased demand  disruptions  or termination could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we manufacture our simox soi wafers using conventional silicon wafers and a variety of chemicals and gases  all of which are available from multiple sources 
we order the chemicals and gases pursuant to blanket purchase orders which generally may be modified or cancelled by us upon days prior notice to the vendor 
in  ibis and memc  a leading global producer of silicon wafers  entered into an alliance pursuant to which memc became our primary supplier of silicon substrate material 
in periods of increasing demand in the semiconductor industry for silicon wafers  we cannot be sure that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of such silicon wafers for manufacture of our products at or near current prices  if at all 
any shortages in the availability of silicon wafers or a significant increase in the price of silicon wafers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our patents and proprietary technology 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
although we have been awarded or have filed applications for a number of patents in the us and foreign countries  those patents may not provide meaningful protection  or pending patents may not be issued 
our competitors in both the us and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have or may obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell our products or intentionally infringe on our patents 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
in addition  there is an inherent unpredictability regarding obtaining and enforcing patents 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling our products 
we also rely in large part on unpatented proprietary technology and others  including strategic partners  may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary technology 
to protect our rights in these areas  we currently require all of our employees to enter into confidentiality agreements 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
others may claim that our technology infringes on their proprietary rights 
any infringement claims  even if without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and may divert management s attention and resources 
if successful  they could also require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business 
if we do not comply with all applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to fines and other sanctions 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  treatment  discharge or disposal of chemicals used in our operations and exposure of our personnel to occupational hazards 
although we believe that we have all permits necessary to conduct our business  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
our future activities may result in our being subject to additional regulations 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with regulations 
our failure to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances or properly control other occupational hazards could subject us to substantial financial liabilities 
our stock price is highly volatile 
the market prices for securities of high tech companies have been volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices for these securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
since january   our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
it is likely that the market price of our stock will continue to fluctuate in the future 
events or factors that may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock include the following quarterly fluctuations in operating results  difficulty in forecasting future results  announcements by us or our present or potential competitors  technological innovations or new commercial products or services by us or our competitors  the timing of receipt of orders from major customers  product mix  product obsolescence  shifts in customer demand  our ability to manufacture and ship products on a cost effective and timely basis  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products or implanters  the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for the products incorporating our simox soi wafers  the amount of research and development expenses associated with new or enhanced products or implanters the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and general market conditions

overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this research led to the development of proprietary next generation oxygen implanters  the ibis  which we began selling in  the i  and also to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  there was a shift in revenue to sales of simox soi wafers for commercial applications and the nature of our business has evolved through stages where sometimes our revenue was primarily derived from selling wafers for evaluation purposes  and at other times it was primarily derived from equipment sales 
this is a normal path to follow while developing and promoting a fundamental new technology  especially when it relates to the semiconductor industry embracing any change that affects fabrication operations 
this trend is expected to continue in the near term as our customers continue to sample soi and the early adopters work to achieve stable production processes and enter pilot production 
we believe that we are in the technology rollout stage of our corporate life cycle with respect to our i simox soi implanters 
we believe that there will be a migration of soi wafer manufacturing into the major silicon wafer suppliers 
we reach this conclusion for a number of reasons 
first  we believe that tremendous price pressure exists on commodity type products  such as silicon wafers  and this pressure is already eroding the price of soi wafers 
because the starting wafer represents a significant component of the soi wafer cost  silicon wafer manufacturers should have a natural cost structure advantage leading to a higher gross margin  and therefore can manage such price pressure better than stand alone soi producers that do not also produce the silicon wafer itself 
second  we expect that the price pressure will encourage silicon wafer manufacturers to seek out higher margin products  like soi wafers  to increase their margins 
third  we believe that silicon wafer manufacturers have traditionally developed proprietary intellectual property in silicon materials science  which can be applied to designing optimal starting wafers for soi production 
this should give them an advantage in both minimizing wafer cost and maximizing soi wafer quality and yield 
fourth  our experience suggests that silicon wafer manufacturers already have a well developed infrastructure for manufacturing  sales and marketing large volumes of substrates 
lastly  we believe that there is greater efficiency in producing the soi wafer as part of the wafer manufacturers existing product flow  specifically avoiding the need to repackage  reclean  reinspect and reship substrates twice  once as starting silicon wafers  and a second time as soi wafers 
therefore  as a result of these trends  we expect our ultimate customers will be drawn from these silicon wafer manufacturers and we plan to focus a majority of our technical and marketing resources on the leading silicon wafer manufacturers and our major key customers in the semiconductor industry who are the leaders in the adoption of soi technology 
we expect that implanter sales to chipmakers should be minimal  but focused on soi processes  which the chipmaker wishes to keep proprietary  such as selective or patterned simox  or other specialty substrates 
our fundamental simox soi technology has been developed  refined  and tested over the last dozen years 
in  we introduced the current generation of simox soi technology  which included our second generation oxygen implanter i and the mld wafer process which was licensed to us by ibm 
we believe that the i s flexibility  automation and operator friendly controls allow this tool to produce a wide range of simox soi wafer products  including advantox mld and advantox mld ut wafers 
we also believe the ability of the i implanter to produce eight and twelve inch or and mm simox soi wafers coupled with the mld process positions us to capitalize on the growing soi market 
in  we commenced a program to design and develop the i  introduced it in march and began shipping mm wafers implanted from this machine shortly thereafter 
a vast majority of the wafers shipped during the fiscal year ended december  were mm 
in september  we received an order valued at approximately million for an i oxygen implanter from a major semiconductor manufacturer 
during the second quarter ended june   our largest customer accepted the i implanter that we shipped to them late last year 
as a result of this acceptance  we recognized revenue of approximately million in the second quarter ended june  during february  we announced the receipt of an order for one ibis i simox implanter  with an option to purchase a second i  from a leading international silicon wafer manufacturer 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to ship this system in the second quarter of depending on completion of the tool and customer acceptance of the tool at our facility 
revenue recognition for this implanter order will be based on final customer acceptance at their facility  the timing of which may vary depending on a number of factors  which include the customer s site being properly facilitized power  water  air and performance of the tool 
commercial shipments of our wafers have been used principally for evaluation purposes or pilot production in products  including microprocessors  gate arrays  asics application specific integrated circuits  memories drams  srams  etc  and cellular and mobile radio components 
from our customers perspective  the pathway to soi adoption is complex and time consuming 
typically  a wafer customer will go through three major stages sampling  where preliminary performance characteristics are explored and verified  r d  where specific customer specifications are tested and developed  and production  where yield and cost benefits are optimized 
each of these stages has many steps  and customers must evaluate each new wafer technology that essentially lays a new foundation for substantially all other processes they have spent billions of dollars and decades of time developing 
accordingly  we believe it takes anywhere from to months for a customer to proceed from initial sampling through r d to initial production  which is not unlike the standard process for qualifying any new wafer material 
these steps apply each time there is a change in the customer s fabrication process  such as a feature size change or new material 
to date  most of our customers have purchased wafers for the purpose of characterizing and evaluating the wafers  developing prototype products or for pilot production  and consequently historical sales are not necessarily an indication of future operations 
at december   ibis owned eight ibis implanters  available to produce up to mm simox wafers and two i s available to produce mm simox wafers 
we also have one additional i implanter under construction that we intend to ship to fulfill the recent order we received from a major silicon wafer supplier 
during the fourth quarter ended december   a number of unexpected events occurred which impacted our mm and smaller wafer size production line including the line s projected cash flow generation and our projected utilization of the assets within our revised plans 
these events included our business prospects for mm simox wafers did not materialize in the fourth quarter as expected  and in part as a result of this we do not now anticipate significant mm wafer business in the future  our existing and potential wafer customers are rapidly transitioning to the mm wafer size and of our wafer sales during fiscal year were for mm simox wafers  a potential buyer completed their evaluation of a portion of our wafer production line and determined that weak demand for mm and smaller simox wafers did not warrant an investment or purchase of this proportion at the present time  and we do not believe there are any material prospects for ibis equipment sales overseas currently 
based on these events and their impact on current and future projected cash flows  our subsequent impairment analysis under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets resulted in an impairment charge of  for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line  which is principally comprised of ibis implanters and associated machinery and equipment not expected to be utilized or sold 
the remaining carrying amount of assets for this line is now approximately  we will continue to review our assumptions about our long lived assets on a periodic basis for potential impairment in future quarters 
we cannot be sure that our implanters or other long lived assets will not become impaired in the future 
in addition  the impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods  given the current trends of the business environment 
ibis has experienced quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to various factors  including the timing of receipt of equipment orders and dependence on a limited number of customers 
our current major wafer customer tends to order fluctuating quantities of wafers on an irregular basis 
this means that this customer  who may account for a significant portion of our net revenue in any given quarter  may not place any orders in the succeeding quarter or quarters 
most of our other wafer customers are sampling simox wafers or are developing prototype products and tend to order small quantities of wafers on an irregular basis 
furthermore  orders can be revised or cancelled at any time prior to delivery 
these ordering patterns resulted in a decrease in mm simox wafer sales during the fourth quarter ended december  and we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenue and operating results due to shifts in customer demands during various stages of the simox soi sales cycle 
in addition  because we have sold only a limited number of implanters to date on an irregular basis  the recognition of revenue from the sale of even one implanter is likely to result in a significant increase in the revenue for that quarter 
we recognize implanter revenue in accordance with sab  which includes  among other criteria  the shipment and factory acceptance of the implanter at the customer s location 
as a result  deferral of revenue will extend longer due to meeting these criteria 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation and reserves  accounts receivable reserves and the assessment of long lived asset impairment 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from wafer product sales  equipment sales and the sales of spare parts when all of the following criteria have been met evidence exists that the customer is bound to the transaction  the product has been delivered to the customer and  when applicable  the product has been installed and accepted by the customer  the sales price to the customer has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured 
we typically recognize revenue from wafer sales upon shipment and recognize revenue from implanter sales upon acceptance at the customer s site 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances are made at the time the products are sold 
revenue derived from contracts and services is recognized upon performance 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized in any period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized 
inventory valuation and reserves 
our policy for the valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally twelve months or less 
if our estimated demand for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
we reserve for a possible over supply of wafers utilizing inventory aging records and for obsolescence when engineering changes or other technological advances indicate that obsolescence has occurred 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when estimated actual cost is significantly different than standard cost and value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
once established  any write downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
accounts receivable reserves 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets 
ibis reviews the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and licenses  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management is required to assess the recoverability of its long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance exists  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and during the fourth quarter of we recognized an impairment charge of  for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december wafer product sales 
wafer product sales increased to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  early in  ibis introduced our current generation oxygen implanter  the i  and for the first time we began shipping mm simox wafers produced on that implanter shortly thereafter 
the increase in wafer product sales is due to increased mm simox wafer demand from one customer in the united states 
sales of mm wafers for the fiscal year ended december  accounted for approximately of our total wafer sales compared to last year 
this increase was offset by decreased wafer sales by ibis in europe  as one of our customers in the optical components arena discontinued a portion of their operations which utilized simox wafers 
wafer sales to customers in the pacific rim also decreased as there are now multiple simox soi wafer suppliers located there 
increased direct simox soi competition would adversely effect our simox wafer sales  however  our current strategy is to be the dominant supplier of simox implanters to the world s silicon wafer manufacturers so they can  in turn  efficiently and cost effectively supply soi wafers to the global semiconductor industry 
in addition  we believe these wafer manufacturers could be potential equipment customers of ours 
contract and other revenue 
contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is attributable to revenue recognized from the transfer of wafer technology to a customer pursuant to a license agreement

cost of wafer product sales for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this is attributable to increased sales of mm wafers along with increased fixed costs mainly depreciation and amortization of mm equipment and the under absorption of overhead expenses 
decreased overhead expenses due to cost savings initiatives offset these increases  as well as lower mm wafer material costs 
cost of contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or due to a decrease in work performed on government contracts 
cost of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is due to higher costs recognized on the sale of the i implanter this year compared to the ibis in the prior year 
in addition  although variable overhead expenses decreased due to cost savings initiatives  we experienced an under absorption of overhead due to lack of implanter demand 
as a result of the foregoing  the total cost of sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the gross margin for all sales was a negative for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a negative for the fiscal year ended december  this improvement in the gross margin for all sales is attributable to a gross margin achieved on the i implanter sale  as well as improved margins on wafer sales due to higher average selling prices of mm wafers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this is primarily a result of increased professional services and premiums on director s officers liability insurance which were offset by decreased payroll and payroll related expenses due to cost savings initiatives

impairment of long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter ended december   a number of unexpected developments occurred which impacted our mm and smaller wafer size production line  including changes in the line s projected cash flow generation and our projected utilization of the assets within our revised plans 
as a result of our subsequent impairment analysis under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets we recognized an impairment charge of  for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line 
the remaining carrying amount of assets for this line is now approximately other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in total other income is primarily attributable to decreased interest income earned as a result of lower cash balances and a reduction in interest rates along with increased interest expense due to a financing arrangement entered into during the second quarter of ibis had federal net operating loss and general business credit carryovers of approximately  and  respectively  at december   that may be used to offset future taxable income  if any  through state net operating loss and credit carryovers of  and  respectively  have varying expiration dates 
deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance of  related to the net operating loss carryover results from the exercise of employee stock options  the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of income tax expense 
net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes may be limited in the event of certain changes in ownership interests

total sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  approximately million of this increase is due to the revenue recognized from the sale of an ibis implanter to a customer in china and the remainder is due to sales of mm simox wafers by ibis 
total cost of sales and revenue 
cost of wafer product sales for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is mainly attributable to the increase in fixed costs associated with production  which include depreciation  amortization and occupancy costs 
equipment repair and maintenance  outside testing services and royalty expenses incurred on the mld process also increased 
in addition  the optimum production yield on our mm wafer products had not yet been realized which resulted in higher costs 
cost of contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
cost of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase is due to costs recognized on the sale of an ibis implanter to a customer in china 
there were no implanter sales during the fiscal year ended december  as a result of the foregoing  the total cost of sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or 
the gross margin for all sales was a negative for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a negative for the fiscal year ended december  the negative gross margin in for all sales is attributable to increased wafer costs and less than optimal production yields on new products  which were partially offset by a gross margin on equipment revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were  of total revenue as compared to  of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or

other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ended december  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in total other income is attributable to non recurring income recognized in amounting to approximately million which is the result of an expired wafer production capacity option and decreased interest income earned as a result of lower average cash balances and a reduction in interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of  including the receipt of proceeds of approximately million from a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share in october the shares were included in a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on september  and declared effective on october  net proceeds from the offering will be used primarily to fund research and development  capital expenditures and working capital 
during the fiscal year ended december   ibis used  of cash for operating activities as compared to  in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
this accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
due to the capital intensive nature of ibis business and the recent expansion of our mm simox wafer production line  management expects that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a significant portion of our expenses 
however  the reduction of  in the carrying amount of our mm and smaller wafer size equipment should result in a decrease in our annual depreciation of approximately million 
to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt and equity financings 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december  were to fund operations and additions to property and equipment which totaled  at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately  in material to be used for wafer manufacturing or for the i implanter currently under construction  and approximately  in capital equipment purchases 
in september  ibis entered into a million equipment lease line with heller financial s commercial equipment finance group 
the lease line was used to finance the purchase of process equipment for wafer production  primarily mm wafers 
this line was fully drawn down in two sale leaseback transactions  bearing interest at approximately with a term of three years  and a monthly net payment of approximately  ibis has a fair market value purchase option at the end of the lease term 
the lease line is secured by the underlying assets and all other property and equipment of ibis 
our existing cash resources are believed to be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the next twelve months 
forecasting future revenue  on a quarter by quarter basis  remains exceedingly difficult and significant variations quarter to quarter  are likely 
we expect to continue to explore equity offerings and other forms of financing and anticipate that we may be required to raise additional capital in the future in order to finance future growth and our research and development programs 
contractual obligations we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k section a ii 
at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty payment obligations total additional information regarding our financial commitments at december  is provided in the notes to our financial statements
