the following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture  and market products for the detection  treatment  monitoring  and tracking of common medical disorders in newborns 
currently  our principal product lines consist of our algo screening products for hearing screening  our neoblue led phototherapy device neoblue phototherapy device for the treatment of jaundice  our neometrics accuwell metabolic screening products used for the predictive indication of metabolic disorders  our neometrics newborn screening data management system  our minimuffs neonatal noise attenuators minimuffs products for the attenuation of noise for newborns  and the nascor product line 
our revenue is generated almost exclusively from the sale of supplies and services  which are generally recurring  and related devices and systems 
supplies and services revenue results from sales of supplies for our algo and co stat medical devices  the nascor product line of heatshields and oxygen delivery hoods  our neometrics accuwell metabolic screening products  software maintenance agreements for our neometrics data management system  as well extended service agreements on our medical devices 
devices and systems revenue results from the sale of our algo  co stat and neoblue medical devices  and our neometrics newborn screening data management system 
domestic sales accounted for of our revenue during  and of our revenue during and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percent of revenue in the future 
if international sales increase  we may not experience corresponding growth in operating income due to the higher cost of selling outside of the us we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us  through our subsidiary in the uk  and to distributors in other countries 
international sales made to distributors are characterized by lower gross margins due to the discount the distributors receive from our list prices 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by the decisions of management regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management and our board of directors make these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions  and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 

table of contents in september  we received clearance from the fda to market our neoblue phototherapy device for the treatment of newborn jaundice  a condition in which the body produces an excessive amount of a potentially toxic substance called bilirubin 
we introduced the neoblue phototherapy device in october at the american academy of pediatrics national conference and exhibition in boston  massachusetts 
our neoblue phototherapy device adds to our medical device products that assist clinicians with the management of newborn jaundice 
in july we purchased substantially all of the assets of neometrics inc for million in cash with the potential for additional consideration contingent upon neometrics achieving certain financial results 
the neometrics accuwell metabolic screening products use blood samples taken from newborns to test for metabolic disorders such as congenital hypothyroidism  phenylketonuria  congenital adrenal hyperplasia  galactosemia  and hemoglobinopathies  and is marketed to government health laboratories domestically and internationally 
the neometrics newborn screening data management system consists of proprietary software that collects  tracks  manages  and reports newborn screening data to regional government health laboratories and national disease control centers 
while all states have laws and or regulations requiring newborn screening for metabolic disorders  the laws and regulations vary widely in the extent of screening required 
we believe that our acquisition of the neometrics lines of business enhances our core newborn screening business  complements our focus on providing products used to identify and monitor common newborn medical disorders  and provides us with a platform for additional growth opportunities 
in october we began selling the oxydome  oxypod  igloo  oxy igloo  and foldadome neonatal oxygen delivery hoods and heatshields  as well as the biliband eye protector 
these products are licensed from australia based nascor pty ltd 
these products are designed to provide a stable environment of oxygen and humidity for newborns with special needs in neonatal units and nurseries 
we do not expect to recognize material revenue from the nascor product line in as of december   we had total federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in and continuing through if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards we can use in any given year and on the ability to use net operating loss carry forwards if we experience a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
in january  we began notifying customers that we will no longer support our co stat end tidal breath analyzer  a device that we developed to provide clinicians with a tool that measures the rate of hemolysis  or red blood cell break down  in newborns 
to that end  we have initiated a plan to remove from service all units currently in use by customers  and we expect this plan to be completed by the middle of we have realized only limited sales from our co stat product since its introduction in and do not expect that this action will have a material impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective  and consequently our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from sales of medical devices  supplies  and metabolic screening products  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers generally upon shipment  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
terms of sales to distributors are exw  an international incoterm  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
revenue from our neometrics newborn screening data management system  which is generally highly customized  is recognized on the percentage of completion basis over the development and implementation period of the associated installation  which typically ranges from six to eighteen months 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations of one year  and post sale training and customer support at the time the related revenue is recognized 

table of contents we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate as well as assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is understated could result in increased operating expense and reduce our results of operations 
at december  our deferred revenue under extended service and maintenance agreements  and billings in excess of recognized revenue on percentage of completion contracts was approximately  other advance payments from customers were not material at december  our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable was  at december  inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value or provide for inventory valuation reserves 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
carrying value of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them  any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october st of each year  however  this assessment may take place at any time in the event of changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
similarly  we test our definite lived intangible assets whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a significant impact on our operating results 
at december  we have intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
liability for product warranties our products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our products during these service periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
until we have historical experience of the cost to honor warranties on new products  we base additions to the reserve on a combination of factors including the standard cost of the product and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating margins and results of operations 
at december  our reserve for product warranties is approximately valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result primarily from net operating loss and credit carry forwards that expire over time  and temporary differences between book and tax results that will reverse in the future 
in evaluating whether we would more likely 
table of contents than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  we include an offsetting expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
future income generation in these tax jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and additional income recognition 
at december   our net deferred tax assets were zero  net of a million valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
certain amounts in the and financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

with the exception of our neometrics newborn screening data management system  the nature of our products and production processes as well as type of customers and distribution methods are consistent among all of product lines 
our neometrics data management system product line is differentiated from our other product lines in that it is not a medical device or related supply product  is not currently regulated by the fda  and revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion basis 
we acquired our neometrics newborn screening data management system product line on july  for the year ending december   our neometrics newborn screening data management system product line did not meet the materiality thresholds for segment reporting 
comparison of and our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the neometrics lines of business accounted for million of the increase  with the remainder resulting from increased sales of algo supplies and neoblue devices 
revenue from devices and systems increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from supplies and services increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from supplies and services were of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in no end customer accounted for more than of our revenue in either or revenue from sales outside the us was million for  up million from million for revenue from europe increased million to million in  revenue from oceania increased  to  in  and revenue from asia increased  to million in international sales of devices and systems increased million to million  and international sales of supplies and services increased million to million 
these increases resulted primarily sales of our algo hearing screening products to both new and existing distributors 
our cost of revenue increased  or  to million in up from million in the neometrics lines of business accounted for million of the increase  which was offset by reductions in manufacturing overhead 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to a reduction in manufacturing overhead as a percent of revenue 
our marketing and selling expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in the decrease in marketing and selling expense was due primarily to a  reduction in personnel costs  in addition to reduced travel and advertising expense of approximately  and other expense reductions 
these cost reductions were partially offset by costs relating to our algo flexicoupler cable transition program  which was substantially completed in  and costs associated with the neometrics business lines 
our research and development expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to a million reduction in personnel costs  as well as reduced travel  outside consultant  contract labor  and prototype expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by costs associated with the neometrics business lines 
our general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a  increases in personnel costs  and costs associated with our neometrics business lines of approximately  offset by a decrease in outside legal  accounting  and recruiting costs 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue  and  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue 
our net other income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  currency gains and losses  and other items  and decreased  or  to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income and a decrease in foreign currency gain 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to reduced interest rates  and the reduction in currency gains resulted primarily from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 

table of contents comparison of and our revenue decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from medical devices  partially offset by an increase in sales of supplies and services 
revenue from medical devices decreased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from supplies increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percent of revenue  revenue from sales of supplies increased to in from in no end customer accounted for more than of our revenue in either or revenue from sales outside the us was million for both and revenue from europe increased million to million in  revenue from oceania increased  to  in  while revenue from asia decreased million to million in international sales of medical devices decreased million to million  while international sales of supplies increased million to million our cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in the cost of revenue was primarily due to the write down of  of excess inventory related to the co stat analyzer  higher costs associated with producing the new algo flexicoupler supply  and increases in manufacturing costs 
cost of revenue also includes an adjustment of  to decrease the reserve for expected warranty costs to reflect recent improved warranty cost experience

our marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the dollar increase in marketing and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the expansion of our international sales efforts  as well as business development efforts 
our research and development expenses increased  or  to million in from million in this increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the development of new products based on technology acquired from pemstar pacific consultants 
our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased legal  accounting and other consulting fees  increases in insurance costs  and increases in reserves for estimated local tax expense 
many of the increased costs resulted from being a public company for the entire year 

table of contents in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  relating to an operating cost reduction plan  which resulted in a reduction of employees and the accrual of associated employee termination related benefits 
the employee reductions were from production  marketing and sales  research and development  and administrative 
accordingly  the related charges were recorded in cost of revenue  marketing and selling  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had paid approximately  of costs related to the restructuring 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue  and million of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue 
our other income expense  net increased  or  to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to foreign currency gains as well as interest earned on greater average cash and short term investment balances in as a result of our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  stockholders equity of million and working capital of million 
net cash used in operating activities of million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for  and net cash used in operating activities of million for cash used in operating activities for resulted from the net loss for the year and decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue as well as an increase in inventory 
these factors were offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and from non cash items such as depreciation  amortization of intangibles  and deferred compensation 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to greater inventory associated with the algo screener product line 
in addition  the primary supplier of our algo flexicoupler supply product moved their production facility in late and we temporarily increased our inventory of the associated supply prior to this move 
net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from the net loss during the period and an increase in inventories  accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses  and a decrease in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
these factors were partially offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to having inventory at our japanese and uk subsidiaries at december   whereas in our independent distributors owned these inventories 
net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from net loss during the period and in increase in inventories and a decrease in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  offset in part by non cash items such as deferred stock compensation and depreciation and amortization 
increases in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily associated with the acquisition and expansion of our wholly owned foreign operations in the uk and japan 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for  and million for net cash used in investing activities during was primarily the result of the acquisition of neometrics for million cash  and related fees for legal and accounting due diligence of  in july  equipment acquisition to upgrade warehouse storage  increases in deposits and other assets  and purchases of short term investments  net of sale proceeds 
net cash used in investing activities during was primarily the result of acquisition of property and equipment  including a major upgrade to the company s existing enterprise resource planning system  as well as increases in deposits and other assets  and purchases of short term investments  net of sale proceeds 
net cash used in investing activities for was primarily for investment of cash received as a result of our initial public offering and for the purchase of new computers  equipment  and furniture as we expanded operations 
because of our investment policy  the types of investments we may make are limited 
primarily all of our short term investments are available for sale securities with maturities of less than one year  and fluctuations between cash equivalents and short term investments are often attributable to investment decisions 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments as of december  we have a  interest bearing certificate of deposit that is classified as a held to maturity investment 
this investment matures in april and was assigned to a bank in february to guarantee a loan on a primary residence of an officer totaling  plus accrued interest 
the loan guarantee originally was collateralized by  shares of our common stock owned by the officer 
during march  in a series of nearly simultaneous transactions the officer placed into escrow additional shares of our common stock in an amount sufficient  at the then current market price  to fully collateralize the principle and interest of the loan  the company purchased those shares from the officer at the then current market price and retired the shares  the officer used the proceeds from sale of the shares to pay the loan in full  and the bank released the assignment of certificate of deposit 
the company expects to redeem the certificate of deposit when it matures in april 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities of  for was from the proceeds of purchases of stock by employees pursuant to our stock option and purchase plans offset by payments on liabilities assumed in the neometrics acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for was primarily from the proceeds of purchases of stock by employees pursuant to our stock option and purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for resulted primarily from the net proceeds received from our initial public offering offset by deferred offering costs 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance extent to which we make acquisitions cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts cost and timing of marketing and selling activities availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
the impact that our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations under employment agreements for services rendered in the normal course of business 
in march  we entered into an agreement to acquire certain intellectual property and technology patents of a private company for million subject to certain conditions to closing and other obligations of the seller 
we financed the acquisition with short term non interest bearing notes payable for which we made payments of  each in april and july we also entered into a product development agreement with respect to the acquired rights  which has been completed as of december  and for which we paid an additional  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and any cash generated from operations and from current or future debt financing will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products  enhancements to our existing products  and in both existing and new product distribution domestically and overseas 
the factors described above will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
in addition  even if our current funds are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next months  we may need to raise additional funds beyond this time  particularly if we invest significant amounts in the acquisition of businesses and products 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us and sell those products primarily in the us  europe  and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars 
prior to our acquisition of our distributor in the uk  our sales in the uk were generally denominated in uk dollars 
since that time  our revenue and expenses in the uk have been denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
as our operations in the uk increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 

table of contents if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net loss would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 
the fair value of our available for sale securities is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
our investment policy permits us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in corporate securities including commercial paper  rated a  p or better  and corporate debt instruments  including medium term notes and floating rate notes issued by foreign and domestic corporations  that pay in us dollars and carry a rating of a or better bank certificates of deposit and banker s acceptances that are rated at least a or p us treasury bills  notes and bonds and us aaa rated agency securities that carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government  including notes  discount notes  medium term notes and floating rate notes asset backed securities rated a or better repurchase agreements with major banks and dealers that are recognized as primary dealers by the federal reserve bank of new york money market mutual funds that offer daily purchase and redemption tax exempt tax advantage investments in money market funds  variable rate demand notes  municipal notes or bonds and auction preferred municipal and corporate securities in july and august  we received million in aggregate net proceeds in connection with our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  but before deducting offering expenses payable by us 
we are currently investing net offering proceeds from the offering pursuant to our investment policy 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees 
fin no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin no 
on december  and the recognition requirements on january  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  eps  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that are not required to consolidate  but in which a company has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
will apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements will apply to entities established on or prior to january  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  the disclosure requirements will apply in all financial statements issued after january  we do not hold any investments or interest that would be considered variable interest entities and  accordingly  the adoption of fin no 
did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations  eps  or cash flows

risk factors we have a history of losses  variable quarterly results  and seasonality in the sale of our products  and may not maintain profitability in the future since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses including net losses for the years  and  and we may incur net losses in the future 
as of december   we had accumulated deficits of approximately million 
the quarter ended december  was our first profitable quarter since our initial public stock offering in july additionally  our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results  and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter budgeting cycle of our customers  particularly government entities  in the us and internationally size and timing of specific sales  such as large purchases of our devices and systems or our supplies and services  by government agencies or hospital systems trade in allowances or other concessions in connection with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  particularly for our neometrics products with which we have limited sales experience and which may have sales cycles that are longer or different from the sales cycles of our algo screener products with which we are more familiar marked changes caused by rapidly evolving technology for newborn screening products as a result  we cannot be certain that we will achieve sustained profitability in the future 
in addition  we experience seasonality in the sale of our products 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter  due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations  which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  and we believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period 
we anticipate that our expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our algo screening  neoblue phototherapy device and other products and technologies develop additional applications for our current technology increase our marketing and selling activities  particularly outside the us continue to increase the size and number of locations of our customer support organization  particularly outside the us develop additional infrastructure and hire required management and other employees to keep pace with our growth as a result of these possible increased expenses  we may need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or  if we achieve profitability  sustain it 

table of contents we have relied  and expect to continue to rely  on sales of our algo screening product family for the majority of our revenue  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our revenue to fall we expect that the revenue from our algo screening product family will continue to account for a majority of our revenue for at least the next two years 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our algo screening equipment and related disposables or demand for our algo screening products  including physician acceptance or the selection of competing products  could cause our revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional newborn products or improving our existing products we intend to develop and acquire additional products and technologies for the detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical conditions in infants and pregnant women 
developing and acquiring new products  and improving our existing products  to meet the needs of neonatologists  audiologists  pediatricians  and nurses requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products and update our existing products  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
we have very limited experience selling and marketing products other than our algo hearing screening products  and our failure to develop and manage our sales force or to effectively market and sell our neometrics products and services  our neoblue phototherapy device  or our other products will hurt our revenue and quarterly results our sales force has limited experience selling our neometrics data management and metabolic function diagnostic products and services and our neoblue phototherapy device and related products  and we cannot predict how successful our sales force will be in selling them  and other products we may develop or acquire  in the future 
in order to successfully introduce and penetrate the market for these and other products  we must successfully sell them to hospital administrators and government agency purchasing managers who may not be familiar with our algo hearing screeners and who may make purchasing decisions on factors that are different from those that our sales people are accustomed to 
we market almost all of our newborn hearing screening products in the us through a direct sales force 
there are significant risks involved in building and managing our sales force to effectively sell our increasingly diverse lines of products and services 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales people with the skills and training to sell our product line effectively 

table of contents if we fail in our efforts to educate physicians  government agency personnel  and third party payors on the effectiveness of our products we will not achieve future sales growth it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators  and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the commercial success of our products depends upon physician  government agency  and other third party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy  reliability  sensitivity  and specificity of our products 
we believe that physicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles  long term clinical data  and experience  that our products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment 
for instance  there are currently alternative neonatal hearing screening products which may be less expensive or may be quicker on a per test basis than our algo devices 
with respect to our neoblue phototherapy device  initial data from clinical research suggests that the device may be more effective in treating hyperbilirubinemia than other currently marketed phototherapy products 
we cannot be certain that clinical studies will produce results that are favorable to our neoblue product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices  and clinical treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if more clinicians  government agencies  and hospital administrators do not adopt our products  we may never have significant revenue or achieve and maintain profitability 
factors that may affect the medical community s acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include publication of clinical study results that demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our algo and neoblue products changing governmental and physician group guidelines for screening of newborns  particularly with respect to full term babies performance  quality  price  and total cost of ownership of our neonatal screening and jaundice management products relative to other such products our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians  physician organizations  hospitals  state laboratory personnel  and third party payors changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for newborn screening equipment and procedures adoption of state and foreign laws requiring universal newborn screening the domestic market for our algo screening products is maturing  and our plan to expand our international operations will result in increased costs and is subject to numerous risks  if our efforts are not successful  this could harm our business the domestic market for our algo screening products is maturing and we plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries 
we must expand the number of distributors who sell our products  or increase our direct international presence  to significantly penetrate international markets 
we have only begun over the past three years to significantly develop our distributor and direct sales force outside the us we currently maintain a direct sales force only in the uk  and increasing our direct sales presence in the uk or elsewhere will require us to incur higher personnel and operating costs that may not result in additional revenues 
a higher percentage of our sales to international distributors could also impair our revenues due to discount prices that we customarily make available to distributors 
we may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international sales  due to the higher costs of sales outside of the us even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the us our international operations are subject to other risks  which include impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors dependence of demand for our products on health care spending by foreign governments greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions difficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval attitudes by clinicians  and cost reimbursement policies  towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business 
table of contents if guidelines requiring universal newborn screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not require testing of all newborns as we anticipate  or if those guidelines have a long phase in period  our revenues may not grow the demand for our screening products depends  in part  upon governments adoption of universal screening requirements for the disorders for which our products screen 
in the us  states have now adopted some form of universal hearing screening requirement  and all states have had mandates for metabolic screening in place for some time 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments  and the phase in period varies from several months to several years 
even fewer foreign countries have adopted rules mandating universal metabolic screening prior to hospital discharge 
the widespread adoption of these guidelines depends  in part  on our ability to educate foreign government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors  and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 
our revenues may not grow if governments do not require universal newborn screening prior to hospital discharge  or if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines  or if the government provides for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in some markets outside of the us and the us  our revenues could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the us some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of physicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan and other developed countries 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 
if we terminate our relationships with distributors for poor performance  as we have done in the past  we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors even if we terminate our relationship for cause 
some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supercede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
these payments could be equal to a year or more of gross margin on sales of our products that the distributor would have earned 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may suffer because of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or strengthening of the us dollar relative to local currencies prior to january  substantially all of our sales contracts provided for payment in us dollars 
however  from through our revenue and expenses in japan and the uk were denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
while we have recently begun requiring payment in us dollars from our reseller in japan and have significantly reduced our yen denominated operating expenses  we have a significant amount on deposit in yen denominated accounts  and we continue to be subject to expenses in the uk that are denominated in gb pounds 
to date we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions and  as a result  our future revenue and expenses may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the translation of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
furthermore  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets where our sales contracts call for payment in us dollars 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies  or if reimbursement policies change adversely  we may never achieve significant revenue physicians  hospitals  and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies 
unless a sufficient amount of positive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may refuse adequate reimbursement unless the infant has demonstrable risk factors 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products 
table of contents or the screenings conducted with our products  it is unlikely that our products will ever achieve significant market acceptance 
acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
although we intend to seek reimbursement or funding approvals in international markets  we may not obtain these approvals in a timely manner or at all 
even if third party payors provide adequate reimbursement for procedures conducted with our products  adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business 
we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors  particularly those in countries and regions outside the us for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
we cannot assure you that in a managed care system the cost of our products will be incorporated into the overall payment for childbirth and newborn care or that there will be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for the procedure 
unless the cost of screening or treatment is reimbursed as a standard component of newborn care  universal screening is unlikely to occur and the number of infants likely to be screened with our products will be substantially reduced 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
for certain of these materials and components  relatively few alternative sources of supply exist 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
during  we experienced delays on the part of a supplier to provide us with volume production of our new algo screening flexicoupler supplies 
if these suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements  it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner  or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer 
replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
there is only one natus approved supplier that provides hydrogel  the adhesive used in many of our disposable products 
in addition  we have relied on single suppliers for several of the antibodies used in some of our neometrics metabolic screening test kits 
a disruption in the supply of this adhesive  or these antibodies  could negatively affect our revenue 
if we were unable to locate another supplier  it could significantly impair our ability to sell our products 
in addition  we may be required to make new or supplemental filings with applicable regulatory authorities prior to our marketing a product containing new materials or produced in a new facility 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval to use a new material  we may not be able to continue to sell the affected products and revenue and operating results could suffer 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenue and gross profits from these sales we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts off of our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profit margins to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of group purchasing organizations  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to group purchasing organization members  the members of these group purchasing organizations now receive volume discounts off our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us from time to time 
sales to members of one group purchasing organization  novation  llc  accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
sales to members of group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of group purchasing organizations with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new group purchasing organizations and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those group purchasing organizations  our revenue and profit margins could decline 

table of contents we rely on sales to existing customers for a majority of our revenue  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenue may decline we rely on sales of additional screening products to our existing customers for a majority of our revenue 
if we fail to sell additional products to our existing customers directly or indirectly  we would experience a material decline in revenue 
our failure to obtain necessary fda clearances or approvals or to comply with fda regulations could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our products in the us  and this would harm our business and financial condition unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations k clearance via section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
we cannot assure you that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that these future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we may not promote or advertise the algo screener  minimuffs  neoblue phototherapy device products  or any of our neometrics diagnostic test kits  or any future cleared or approved devices  for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances or are unsupported it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenue could decline  and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties recall or seizure of our products issuance of public notices or warnings imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production refusal of our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawal of k clearance or premarket approvals already granted criminal prosecution 
table of contents if we fail to obtain and maintain necessary foreign regulatory approvals in order to market and sell our products outside of the us  we may not be able to sell our products in other countries our products that are regulated domestically by the fda are also regulated outside the us by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and are subject to regulatory requirements similar to the fda s 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from the fda requirements 
we may not be able to obtain these approvals without incurring significant expenses or at all  and we may not be able to maintain these approvals once they have been obtained 
if we  or our suppliers  fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenue could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including natus and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
although we have passed inspections in the past  we cannot assure you that we  or our contract manufacturers  will pass any future quality system regulation inspections 
if we  or our contract manufacturers  fail one of these inspections in the future  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing and sales delayed significantly until we can demonstrate adequate compliance 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulations inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations and require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 
incidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect our business portions of our operations in our portland facility previously required the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
although we do not currently conduct operations that require us to use hazardous or radioactive materials  we have such materials in controlled storage on site in preparation for disposal 
our storage and disposal of such materials is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations 
we believe our safety procedures for storage and disposal of such materials comply with applicable federal  state  and local regulations  however  the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an incident  we could be liable for any damages that result  which could adversely affect our business 
our storage and disposal of such waste potentially exposes us to environmental liability if  in the future  such storage or disposal is deemed to have violated such laws and or regulations or if the storage  treatment and disposal facilities are inadequate and are proved to have damaged the environment 
environmental  health and safety regulation by the government could adversely affect our operations our operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental  health  safety and other governmental laws and regulations 
while we believe that we have obtained the requisite approvals and permits for our existing operations  and that our business is operated in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects  we remain subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations 
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us  that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we experience intense competition from other medical device companies or state funded programs  and this competition could adversely affect our revenue and our business we sell our products in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets 
we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sales of their products 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical device vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation or by bundling together  or with other products  their hearing screening  jaundice treatment  data systems  or newborn metabolic screening products large medical device vendors may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors 
we expect that the medical device industry will continue to consolidate 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 

table of contents we may not be successful in integrating the businesses that we acquire  or the businesses may not perform as projected we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar pacific consultants during  and we acquired the assets of neometrics inc and affiliated entities during we expect to make additional acquisitions of products  technology assets or businesses in the future as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including integration of the acquired products into our business integration of the personnel of the acquired company into our business failure to realize expected synergies failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales failure to maintain customers of  or other relationships existing with respect to the acquired business failure to successfully develop the acquired technology into the desired products or enhancements assumption of unknown liabilities failure to understand and compete effectively in markets and with products or technologies with which we have limited previous experience write off of goodwill and intangible assets related to such acquisitions while we make efforts to analyze potential acquisitions carefully and to value assets and their related future lives appropriately  we cannot be certain that any completed acquisitions will positively impact our business 
if we fail to achieve the anticipated financial  strategic  and other benefits of acquisitions or investments  our operating results may suffer 
our operating results could suffer if future changes in technology or market conditions result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets we currently have significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events that we have no control over 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions where our products are no longer competitive 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to our intellectual property or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
the company holds approximately us patents and foreign patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of our intellectual property rights 

table of contents our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award the medical technology industry has  in the past  been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we expect that medical screening products may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards divert our management s attention and resources cause product shipment delays or suspensions require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all a successful claim of infringement against us could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition 
our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates the sale and use of our medical testing products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional employees  we cannot grow or achieve and maintain profitability our products and technologies are complex  and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
our future success also will depend  in part  on the continued service of our key management personnel  software engineers  and other research and development employees and our ability to identify  hire  and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing  and sales staff 
hiring research and development  engineering  sales  marketing and customer service personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of pediatric audiology  neonatal jaundice management  and neonatal metabolic screening 
we may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
on january   the company entered into a transition agreement and release with tim johnson  the company s president  chief executive officer  chief operating officer  and a director 
pursuant to the agreement  the company and mr

we could lose the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  which may adversely affect our financial results as of december   we had a total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  will expire in various amounts beginning in through if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the ability of corporations to use net operating loss carryforwards if the corporation experiences a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
we cannot assure you that we will not take actions  such as the issuance of additional stock  which would cause an ownership change to occur 
accordingly  we may be limited to the amount we can use in any given year  so even if we have substantial net income  we may not be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs  and are thus subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
we have not undertaken a study to determine whether such limitations exist  and if so  the extent of such limitations 
however  we believe it is probable that some amounts of our net operating losses will be affected 

table of contents if we have taxable income in the future  and we are unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  our future tax payments could be higher and our financial results may suffer 
we may incur significant costs related to a class action lawsuit due to the likely volatility of the public market price of our stock our stock price has fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  for a number of reasons including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations our ability to successfully commercialize our products announcements of technological or competitive developments by us or our competitors announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors announcements regarding state screening mandates or third party payor reimbursement policies regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts general market conditions  particularly for companies with a relatively small number of shares available for sale in the public market securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility of the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert our management s attention from running our business 
our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates hold a substantial portion of our stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  regardless of the wishes of other stockholders as of march   our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and individuals or entities affiliated with them beneficially own in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock  one stockholder owns approximately 
if some or all of these stockholders act together  they could significantly influence all matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and determination of significant corporate actions 
this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change of control transaction that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may affect the price of our common stock  and make it more difficult to remove our management 
further  these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest  or to acquire us  even though such events may be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may affect the price of our common stock  and could make it more difficult for a third party to remove our management 
further  these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
among other things  these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders may discourage  delay  or prevent a third party from removing our management acquiring a large portion of our securities  initiating a tender offer or proxy contest  or acquiring us  even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over then current market price
