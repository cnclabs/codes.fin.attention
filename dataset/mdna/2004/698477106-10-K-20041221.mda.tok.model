item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements for and later periods are made throughout this report 
such statements represent estimates of management based on the company s historical operating trends  its proved oil and gas reserves and other information currently available to management 
the company cautions that the forward looking statements provided herein are subject to all the risks and uncertainties incident to the acquisition  development and marketing of  and exploration for oil and gas reserves 
these risks include  but are not limited to oil and natural gas price risk  environmental risk  drilling risk  reserve quantity risk and operations and production risks 
for all the above reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements and there is no assurance that the assumptions used are necessarily the most likely to occur 
general the company s principal line of business is the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
results of operations are dependent upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for such production 
prices received by the company for the sale of its oil and natural gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
such fluctuations affect the company s ability to maintain or increase its production from existing oil and gas properties and to explore  develop or acquire new properties 
the following table reflects certain operating data for the periods presented for the year ended september  production oil bbls gas mcf average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf results of operations compared to overview the company recorded a net income of  in  compared to a net income of  in total revenues were larger as a result of increased oil and gas sales revenues generated by increases in the average sales prices of oil and natural gas in as compared to it currently appears oil and gas sales prices will remain at the levels seen in  or even slightly increased  for at least the next year 
revenues total revenues increased to  in compared to  in the increase was due to increases in the average sales price for oil and natural gas in production volumes were basically flat in compared to new production from the company s drilling activity almost replaced the normal production decline of existing gas wells  thus  gas production declined only 
oil wells beginning production in replaced the decline of existing oil well production  and increased oil production 

table of contents lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe continues to increase each year as the company increases the number of working interest wells in which it has an interest and due to normal inflation of costs 
gross production taxes are paid as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues and thus  increased in due to the increase in oil and gas sales revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs decreased  or in as compared to the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations thus  only exploratory dry holes result in their costs being charged to exploration costs 
in fiscal  there were no high cost exploratory dry holes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a increased  or in as compared to the increase is due to several new wells  with large cost basis  going on production in and having high initial production rates 
these production rates and the large cost basis resulted in the increase in dd a 
provison for impairment the provision for impairment increased  or in as compared to this increase was the result of several older fields fair values being reduced along with several individual wells  which were completed and began production in  having a fair value at year end less than their book value  as their initial production rates were substantially less than expected 
general and administrative costs g a g a costs increased  or in personnel related expenses including salaries  payroll taxes  insurance and esop expenses increased approximately  in g a expense related to the non employee directors deferred compensation plan the plan increased approximately  in the increase resulted from the company recognizing a charge to g a to adjust the potential shares in the plan to market price at september  the non employee directors have taken these potential shares  rather than a cash payment for their directors fees 
interest expense interest expense decreased  or in the decrease was due to lower average outstanding debt balances during provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased in  due to increased income before taxes as discussed above 
the company continued to be able to utilize excess percentage depletion on its oil and gas properties to reduce its tax liability  and its effective tax rate from the federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate was approximately in  in  while a tax benefit was provided in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had positive working capital of  as compared to  at september  the increase in working capital at september  compared to september   is the result of increased oil and gas sales revenues during  which is discussed in results of operation above 
cash flow from operating activities increased to  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in oil and gas sales prices 
capital expenditures for oil and gas activities for amounted to  as compared to  for the company has historically funded its capital expenditures  overhead costs and dividend payments from operating cash flow 
due to the increased capital expenditure level in  the company borrowed on its revolving bank loan to help fund those expenditures 
however  as a result of the increased cash flow from higher prices received for natural gas in fiscal  the company was able to reduce its bank debt by a net of  approximately million is available under the company s current bank debt facility for capital expenditures  acquisitions or any combination of uses 
further  the credit facility could be increased  if needed  for a large acquisition 
the company expects to increase its capital expenditure level to approximately million in funds for this level of expenditures will come from cash flow and or bank debt  if required 
contractual obligations the company has a credit facility with bancfirst of oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the facility consists of a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan in the amount of  which is subject to a semi annual borrowing base determination 
the current borrowing base under the facility is  the term loan matures on april   and the revolving loan matures on march  monthly payments on the term loan are  plus accrued interest  beginning on may  borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity 
interest on the term loan is fixed at until maturity 
the revolving loan bears interest at the national prime rate minus at september  or libor for one  three or six month periods  plus 
the company  at september   has elected the prime rate option 
the total outstanding borrowings under both the term loan and the revolving line of credit may not exceed the borrowing base  which is million as of september  subsequent determinations of the borrowing base are made semi annually or whenever the bank  in its sole discretion  believes that there has been a material change in the value of the oil and gas properties 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants which  among other things  require periodic financial and reserve reporting and limit the company s incurrence of indebtedness  liens  dividends and acquisitions of treasury stock  and require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at september  the company was in compliance with the covenants 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations 
table of contents compared to overview the company recorded a net income of  in  compared to a net income of  in total revenues were larger as a result of significantly increased oil and gas sales revenues generated by increases in the average sales prices of oil and natural gas in as compared to revenues total revenues increased to  in compared to  in the increase was due to a large increase in the average sales price for natural gas in  offset some what by a decrease in oil production volumes in gas production volume was basically flat in compared to new production from the company s drilling activity replaced the normal production decline of existing gas wells allowing gas production to remain flat 
fewer oil wells have been drilled in recent years  thus  oil production continues to decline as existing wells production continues its normal decline 
lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe continues to increase each year as the company increases the number of working interest wells in which it has an interest and due to normal inflation of costs 
the company participated in a record number of working interest wells in gross production taxes are paid as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues and thus increased substantially in due to the large increase in oil and gas sales revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs increased  or in as compared to the increased costs were primarily dry hole costs 
as previously mentioned  the company participated in a record number of wells in  several of which were exploratory wells 
as the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations exploratory dry holes result in the expensing of all costs associated with those wells 
several of the exploratory wells drilled in were dry holes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a declined  or in the decline was principally due to decreased oil production volume in  reducing the units of production  dd a on the company s oil properties 
provison for impairment the provision for impairment of the company s oil and gas properties decreased  or in this decrease can be principally attributed to the higher market price for natural gas at year end as compared to year end  which increased the fair value of the company s oil and gas properties in as compared to the carrying amount of the properties 
general and administrative costs g a g a costs increased  in personnel related expenses including salaries  payroll taxes  insurance expenses and esop expenses increased approximately  in g a expense 
table of contents related to the non employee directors deferred compensation plan the plan increased approximately  in this increase was a result of the company recognizing a charge to general and administrative expense to adjust the potential shares in the plan to market price at september   versus a minimal charge in for the same adjustment 
the non employee directors have taken these potential shares  rather than a cash payment for their director s fees 
in addition  the company incurred expenses of approximately  upon listing its shares on the american stock exchange in interst expense interest expense decreased  or in the decrease was due to lower outstanding debt balances  and lower effective interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased in  due to a much larger income before taxes as discussed above 
the company continued to be able to utilize tax credits from production of tight gas sands natural gas and excess percentage depletion on its oil and gas properties to reduce its tax liability  and its effective tax rate from the federal and state statutory rates 
the effective tax rate was approximately in and while a tax benefit was provided in liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had positive working capital of  as compared to negative working capital of  at september  the increase in working capital from september  to september   is the result of increased oil and gas sales revenues during  which is discussed in results of operation above  and the reduction in the current portion of long term debt by  this reduction in the current portion of long term debt is the result of the restructuring of the company s bank debt in march the fixed monthly principal payment on the bank debt was reduced from  to  for a further discussion of the company s bank debt see note long term debt of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
cash flow from operating activities increased to  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a significant increase in product sales prices 
capital expenditures for oil and gas activities for amounted to  as compared to  for  exclusive of  used to acquire wood oil company 
the company has historically funded its capital expenditures  overhead costs and dividend payments from operating cash flow 
due to the increased capital expenditure level in  the company borrowed  early in the year   on its revolving bank loan to help fund those expenditures 
as a result of the increased cash flow from higher prices received for natural gas in the last three quarters of fiscal  the company made total principal payments of  on its bank debt 
the company has approximately million available credit under the bank debt facility which is in place  for capital expenditures  acquisitions or any combination of uses 
further  the credit facility could be increased  if needed  for a large acquisition 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 
table of contents the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not change the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  impairment of assets and tax accruals 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  geologists and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known 
oil and gas reserves of these judgments and estimates  management considers the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves to be the most significant 
changes in crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates affect the company s calculation of depreciation and depletion  provision for abandonment and assessment of the need for asset impairments 
the company s consulting engineer with assistance from company geologists prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
as required by the guidelines and definitions established by the securities and exchange commission  these estimates are based on current crude oil and natural gas pricing 
as previously discussed  crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide consumption and are outside the control of management 
projected future crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions are used by management to prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves used in formulating managements overall operating decisions in the exploration and production segment 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by field using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
this accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
impairment of assets all long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as inflation rates  future sales prices for oil and gas  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test a field for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the company approves the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject 
table of contents to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
tax accruals the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
operations and cash flows are also impacted by changes in the market interest rates related to the revolving credit facility which bears interest at an annual variable interest rate equal to either the national prime rate minus or libor for one  three or six month periods  plus 
at september   a change in the prime interest rate would result in approximately a  change in annual interest expense 
the company has a  term loan outstanding balance of  at september  which matures on april  the interest rate is fixed at until maturity
