overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in four core markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc and san francisco 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  costs of tenant improvements  operating costs and real estate taxes  vacancy and general economic factors 
our industry s performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth 
in  while the overall united states economy began to demonstrate sustained overall economic growth  there were few indications that the economy was creating jobs at a pace sufficient to lead to increased demand for our office space 
we continued to operate in a period of weak fundamentals  evidenced by relatively high vacancy and correspondingly lower market rents 
our corporate strategy of owning high quality office buildings concentrated in strong  supply constrained markets and emphasizing long term leases to creditworthy tenants lessened the overall impact of the weak fundamentals in the operating environment by limiting our lease expiration exposure both from natural lease expirations and from terminations due to tenant defaults 
this ameliorated the potential decline in gross revenues even as we renewed or re let space at lower rents and enabled us to experience only a very slight decline in our portfolio occupancy 
in the face of these challenging market conditions  we have followed a disciplined approach to managing our operations by focusing primarily on enhancing the value of our existing portfolio through strategic sales and successful leasing efforts and by solidifying our capital structure through the refinancing of a significant portion of our variable rate debt with long term fixed rate 
at the same time  we continued to selectively pursue new acquisition and development opportunities 
the highlights of our activity reflect this strategy 
we sold three real estate assets for gross sales prices totaling million 
we also leveraged our strong relationships to acquire million of interests in real estate assets in the washington  dc area 
we completed the construction and lease up of two development projects  the  square foot two freedom square building in the washington  dc suburb of reston  virginia and the  square foot 
table of contents shaws supermarket at the prudential center in boston 
these buildings were leased upon completion 
we have three remaining development projects new dominion technology park  building two  times square tower  and new york avenue 
new dominion technology park  building two is a  square foot building located in the washington dc suburb of herndon  va and that is leased to the general services administration 
times square tower is a story building with million net rentable square feet 
times square tower  a portion of which will be placed into service in the spring of  is currently approximately leased 
this building was originally pre leased to arthur andersen  but that lease was terminated in the wake of that firm s demise 
new york avenue is a  square foot building located in washington  dc in which we have a interest 
this building is leased as of december  we did not commence construction on any new office developments in although during the year we purchased land and formed joint ventures with land owners that will offer the opportunity to commence development in or beyond 
the strength of our portfolio supplemented with the acquisitions and new developments that were brought on line in allowed us to increase our total revenue by in we refinanced million of variable rate debt with unsecured fixed rate debt at an average interest rate of with maturities ranging from to years 
we also entered into amended loan agreements with existing lenders on million of debt during the year 
at the end of  our fixed rate debt represents of our total outstanding debt 
our variable rate debt at the end of consisted of our two construction facilities associated with our two remaining development projects and our unsecured revolving credit facility 
we believe that the matching of our long term fixed rate debt financing with the long duration of our leases represents an appropriately prudent financial structure  but this has come with the short term cost of greater interest expense than we would have incurred with variable rate debt financing 
we are optimistic that market conditions will not deteriorate further 
however  without strong job growth in our markets  we do not expect to see significant improvement in occupancy or rental rates during we are well positioned to weather a continuation of the current operating environment and prosper when sustained job growth resumes 
if such job growth is accompanied by a rising interest rate environment  we will have a financial platform that will enable us to realize the benefits of our long term fixed rate debt 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in 
table of contents place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value  using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired  equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which was adopted on january   requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of our properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 

table of contents determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement 
our capitalization policy on our development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in a variable interest entity  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence  but do not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over years 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included on the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
we serve as the development manager for the joint venture at new york avenue currently under development 
the profit on development fees received from this joint venture is recognized to the extent attributable to the outside interest in the joint venture 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair value over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
we maintain an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses 
the credit assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit status  as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue issue requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we record our development fees earned on real estate projects on a straight line basis over the development period  which approximates the percentage of completion method described in sop and provides a more 
table of contents accurate measurement over the period of fees earned 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  since such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments we calculate the fair value of our mortgage debt notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
in addition  we are also required to adjust the carrying values of our derivative contracts on a quarterly basis to their fair values 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and commencing during the third quarter of  we began reporting on a consolidated basis the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with the ownership of our hotels through our taxable reit subsidiary  whereas in the past we only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes 
as a result the reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended december  is not directly comparable to the year ended therefore  hotel revenue and hotel expenses have been presented on a net basis for the twelve month period ended december  otherwise entitled hotel net operating income to provide a basis of comparison to prior periods 
as of december  and  we owned properties and properties  respectively we refer to all of the properties that we own as our total portfolio 
our property operations  including property management  development and leasing are regionally aligned with the objective of becoming the dominant landlord in our core markets 
management reviews operating and financial data for each property separately and independently from all other properties 
major decisions regarding the allocation of financing  investing  information technology and capital allocation are made in conjunction with the input of senior management located in our corporate headquarters 

table of contents as a result of changes in within our total portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period 
we do not believe our period to period financial data are comparable due to the changes in our total portfolio 
therefore  the comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and show changes resulting from properties that we owned for each period compared we refer to this comparison as our same property portfolio for the applicable period and the changes attributable to our total portfolio

table of contents rental revenue the increase in rental revenue of million in the total portfolio primarily relates to new leases signed and in place in connection with the acquisition of park avenue in the third quarter of  the purchase of the remaining interests in one and two discovery square as of april  and the purchase of the remaining interests in one and two freedom square as of august   as well as the purchase of new hampshire avenue 
these additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately million  as described below revenue for the year ended property date acquired change in thousands park avenue september     one and two discovery square april    one and two freedom square august    new hampshire ave october    total additions this increase was offset by a decrease of million due to the sale of one and two independence square and n street during and that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties 
in addition  the placing into service of five times square in the first quarter of  continued lease up of huntington avenue  waltham weston corporate center which was placed into service during and the addition of shaws supermarket in boston added revenue of million 
the overall increase in the remaining same property portfolio reflects declining base rents of approximately million and a slight decrease in occupancy offset by an increase in straight line rents of million resulting from increased free rent periods on renewals during as well as an increase in operating expense reimbursements related to higher operating expenses 
termination income termination income for the year ended december  was related to tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately million 
this compared to termination income earned for the year ended december  related to tenants totaling million 
as the business climate continues to improve  we expect termination income will dissipate to levels below and development and management services the increase in development and management services income of million primarily resulted from the recognition of fees in the current year on certain third party development projects  some of which began in  and an overall increase in management fees due to the continuing involvement in properties sold during development fees increased by million on the church street project in new york city related to the services provided to remediate damages resulting from the events of september  there was an overall increase of million in development fees in washington  dc on the national institute of health and new york avenue projects 
during  approximately million was recognized as development fees on the construction of the residential building  the belvidere in boston  ma 
the remaining increases relate to new management agreements entered into with the sale of n street and one and two independence square for the year ended december  our third party revenue is project specific and highly dependent on our ability to secure third party development contracts 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased by million in the total portfolio for the year ended december  of the total variance  million is a result of interest earned on a note receivable related to the sale of 
table of contents real estate in september in addition  during there was a one time refund of approximately million  which related to the resolution of a prior year tax matter 
operating expenses property operating expenses in the total portfolio real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance  cleaning and other property related expenses increased by million 
approximately million of the increase is due to the additions of park avenue  new hampshire avenue  one and two discovery square and one and two freedom square 
the increases were offset by a decrease of million related to one and two independence square and n street which were sold during and and that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties 
in addition  the continued lease up of huntington avenue  five times square and waltham weston corporate center properties which were placed into service during and the placing into service shaws supermarket in boston added approximately million of operating expenses 
the remaining increases are due to the overall increase in same property portfolio operating expenses of million 
property operating expenses in the same property portfolio increased during the year ended december  primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of million  or  and increases in insurance of million  or 
the increases in real estate taxes are due to higher property tax assessments and rate increases  specifically in new york  which represented million of the increase 
increases in insurance premiums in the same property portfolio and total portfolio are related to increases in premium rates on existing coverage as well as the increased cost to purchase coverage under the federal terrorism risk insurance act of other decreases were mainly due to an overall decrease in occupancy from at december  to at december  hotel net operating income net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by million or approximately for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these decreases are due to the ongoing downturn being experienced in business travel and the tourism industry in the boston market 
while our boston area hotels have yet to show any meaningful improvement  we are cautiously optimistic that they will gradually recover in with the democratic national convention and a number of other city wide events scheduled to be held in boston 
the following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the years ended december  and occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room  revpar other expenses general and administrative general and administrative expenses in the total portfolio decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  by million or 
a decrease of million is related to the write off of unrecoverable leasing commissions related to our termination of the lease with arthur andersen for  square feet at the times square tower during the second quarter of in addition  an increase of million is attributed to changes in the form of equity based compensation  as further described below 

table of contents in  we transitioned to using solely restricted stock and or long term incentive plan units of limited partnership  or ltip units  as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock  under the stock option and incentive plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation 
employees vest in restricted stock and ltip units over a five year term 
restricted stock and ltip units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the price of our common stock on the date of grant as quoted on the new york stock exchange 
such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period 
to the extent restricted stock or ltip units are forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was million during the year ended december  stock based compensation associated with million of restricted stock that was granted in january will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five year vesting period 
stock based compensation associated with approximately million of restricted stock and ltip units that were granted in january will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and ltip units vest 
to the extent we continue our policy of granting restricted equity awards we will continue to experience higher costs associated with equity based compensation until at which time the incremental increase associated with each year s award will be fully realized 
interest expense interest expense for the total portfolio increased as a result of our strategic decision to replace our variable rate debt with primarily unsecured fixed rate debt and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest on development projects 
this was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on five times square  huntington avenue  two freedom square  shaw s supermarket and gateway and the issuance of billion of unsecured fixed rate senior notes including million issued in december 
our total debt outstanding at december  was approximately billion compared to billion at december  december  dollars in thousands debt summary balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate variable rate total depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the total portfolio increased as a result of the additions and placing into service of five times square  huntington avenue  park avenue  one and two discovery square  one and two freedom square  gateway  new hampshire avenue and other properties which 
table of contents we acquired or placed in service after january  the increases were offset by decreases of million related to properties that were sold during and that were not classified as discontinued operations 
costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  wages  property taxes  insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized wages for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above 
interest capitalized for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above 
net derivative losses net derivative losses for the total portfolio represent the mark to market and cash settlements of our derivative contracts  consisting of interest rate swaps  payments that were not effective for accounting purposes 
the fair value of our derivative contract which was million at december   is included on our balance sheets 
as a result of our contract modification in august we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk joint ventures the decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the total portfolio as well as the same property portfolio is related to the purchase of the remaining interests in one and two discovery square and one and two freedom square 
one and two discovery square are included in the total portfolio revenue as of april  one and two freedom square are included in the total portfolio revenue as of august  the reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from joint ventures to decrease for the year ended december  other gains on sales of real estate for the year ended december  related to the sale of n street in the first quarter for a gain of million 
in the second and third quarter  there was a transfer of certain mortgage issuance costs  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements that resulted in a gain of million net of minority interest share of million 
gains on sales of real estate for the year ended december  related to the sale of one and two independence square were not included in discontinued operations as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement after the sale 
the decrease in income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was a result of the discontinued properties being sold during the first quarter of accordingly  unlike in we did not recognize a full quarter of revenue and expenses with respect to those properties for the first  second or third quarter of in addition  income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  included two properties sold during for both periods  sugarland business park building two and rozzi place are included as part of income from discontinued operations 
gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended december  primarily related to the gain recognized on the sale of third avenue and the candler building 
the gains on sales for the year ended december  are the result of the dispositions of fullerton square  consisting of two office technical properties totaling  square feet in springfield  virginia and   and boston boulevard  consisting of three buildings totaling  square feet in springfield  virginia 
the decrease in our preferred dividend of million for the year ended december  was a result of the conversion of  shares of our preferred stock into common stock in july
