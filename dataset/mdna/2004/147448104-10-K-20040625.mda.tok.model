item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the section of this annual report on form k entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
casella waste systems  inc and subsidiaries is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily throughout the eastern region of the united states 
as of june   we owned and or operated eight subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber 
from may  through december  we acquired solid waste collection  transfer and disposal operations 
in december  we acquired kti 
kti assets which we considered core to our operations included interests in waste to energy facilities in maine  significant residential and commercial recycling operations  transfer and collection operations which were tuck ins to existing operations and cellulose insulation manufacturing operations 
in addition  kti s assets included a number of businesses that were not core to our operating strategy 
following our acquisition of kti  we focused on the integration of kti and the divestiture of non core kti assets  which has now been completed 
as part of the divestiture program  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we incurred non recurring charges of million  of which million was non cash 
the divestiture program resulted in aggregate consideration of million  including cash proceeds of million which were used to reduce our indebtedness 
revenues related to divested assets were million in fiscal year since december  we have made acquisitions 
in december  we commenced operations at ontario county landfill  after executing a year operation  management and lease agreement with ontario county  new york 
the landfill is permitted to accept  tons per year of municipal solid waste 
on february   we completed transactions with the state of maine and georgia pacific  pursuant to which the state of maine took ownership of the landfill located in west old town  maine formerly owned by georgia pacific and we became the operator of that facility under a year operating and services agreement between us and the state of maine 
on august   we announced that we were selected by the mckean county  pennsylvania solid waste authority as the successful bidder to negotiate a service agreement to operate and develop the county s landfill 
we cannot assure that the negotiations will result in a final service agreement 
our revenues increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april  from may  through april   we acquired solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling operations 
under the rules of purchase accounting  the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included from the date of acquisition and affect the period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations 
effective september   we transferred our export brokerage operations to former employees  who had been responsible for managing that business 
the domestic brokerage operations  and a recycling business  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues  were transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
due to the structure of these transactions  the transfers were not initially recorded as a sale 
effective april   we completed the sale of the export brokerage operations for total consideration of approximately million 
the gain on the sale amounted to approximately million 
for the fiscal years ended april   and  the transferred brokerage and recycling businesses accounted for million  and million  respectively  of our revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
landfill accounting adoption of sfas no 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
through april  we recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of production basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of capitalized and future landfill capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future capping costs are identified by specific capping events and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption  sfas no 
required a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
sfas no 
required the creation of the related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization and an adjustment to the capping  closure and post closure liability for cumulative accretion 
at may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended april   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs historically have not taken into account discounts for the present value of costs to be paid in the future 
under sfas no 
 our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated by to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid 
these estimated costs are then discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
under sfas no 
 we no longer accrue landfill retirement obligations through a charge to cost of operations  but rather by an increase to landfill assets 
under sfas no 
 the amortizable landfill assets include not only the landfill development costs incurred but also the recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities as well as the cost estimates for future capping  closure and post closure costs 
the landfill asset is amortized over the total capacity of the landfill as airspace is consumed during the life of the landfill  with one exception 
the exception is for capping for which both the recognition of the liability and the amortization of these costs are based instead on the airspace consumed for the specific capping event 
landfill accounting capitalized costs and amortization we use life cycle accounting and the units of production method to recognize certain landfill costs 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to the acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized or accrued and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land and related airspace  permitting costs and preparation costs 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
management routinely reviews its investment in operating landfills  transfer stations and other significant facilities to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of production method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and permittable capacity 
to be considered permittable  airspace must meet all of the following criteria we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received within the next two to five years  and senior management has approved the project 
units of production amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by airspace surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs  we consider the landfill costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimate of future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs for the year ended april  increased to million  compared to million for the year ended april  and million for the year ended april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill and landfill operating contracts  which increased airspace to million tons as of april  as compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  landfill amortization expense for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher landfill amortization due to increased landfill volumes and as a result of adopting sfas no 
higher landfill amortization expense in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was due to volume increases 
landfill accounting capping costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill accounting closure and post closure costs closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred during the period after the facility closes 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
sfas no 
requires that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs historically have not taken into account discounts for the present value of costs to be paid in the future 
under sfas no 
 our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated by to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid 
these estimated costs are then discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
our estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs was million for the year ended april   compared to million for the year ended april  and million for the year ended april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill and landfill operating contracts  which increased airspace to million tons as of april  compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  accrued capping  closure and post closure costs include the current and non current portion of costs associated with obligations for capping  closure and post closure of our landfills 
the changes to accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities are as follows in thousands years ended april  beginning balance  may cumulative effect of change in accounting principle capping  closure  and post closure liability  adjusted obligations incurred revisions in estimates accretion expense payments acquisitions and other adjustments balance  april  upon adoption of sfas no 
 on may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended april   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
spending levels increased in fiscal year mainly due to closure activities at our woburn  massachusetts and pine tree  maine landfills 
in fiscal year  we recorded additional post closure accruals relating to one of our construction and demolition landfills 
in fiscal year  we recorded closure and post closure accruals relating to the hardwick landfill acquisition 
the increase in fiscal is as a result of capping  closure and post closure accruals relating to the acquisition of the southbridge landfill operating contract 
we estimate our future capping  closure and post closure costs in order to determine the capping  closure and post closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in note l to our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated timeframe for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill  as well as the duration of the post closure monitoring period 
based on our permitted and permittable airspace at april   we expect to make payments relative to capping  closure and post closure activities from fiscal year through fiscal year asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is then recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we adopted sfas no 
effective may  and have eliminated the amortization of goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by reference to past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
discontinued operations prior to fiscal year  we carried discontinued businesses at estimated net realizable value less costs to be incurred through the date of disposition 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are separately classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k and other reports  proxy statements  and other communications to stockholders  as well as oral statements by our officers or our agents  may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act  with respect to  among other things  our future revenues  operating income  or earnings per share 
without limiting the foregoing  any statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements  and the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors of which we are aware that may cause our actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement  certain of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  without limitation  those outlined below in the section entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
our failure to successfully address any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
general revenues our revenues in our eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of our disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr and in the eastern  central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
fcr recycling revenues included revenues from commercial brokerage and recycling operations through june  and revenues from the export brokerage business through september  when those operations were sold 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts  earnings from equity method investees and  in fiscal year  revenues from residue recycling 
our revenues are shown net of inter company eliminations 
we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our revenues attributable to services provided 
for the fiscal year ended april   and  the percentages of revenues shown below reflect revenues from the domestic brokerage and recycling operations through june  and revenues from the export brokerage business through september the export business was transferred to the employees of that unit in september and our domestic brokerage operations  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues was transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
excluding the effect of brokerage revenues  collection and transfer revenues as a percentage of total revenue were lower in the fiscal year ended april  compared to the prior year  despite an increase in the absolute dollar amounts  mainly because of the large increase in recycling revenue dollars 
collection revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal year were lower as a percentage of total revenue  mainly because of the large increase in recycling revenue dollars 
net of brokerage revenues  landfill disposal revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal years  and remained constant 
the increase between fiscal years in recycling revenues as a percentage of total revenues is mainly due to higher commodity prices and volumes 
the decrease in brokerage revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to lower commodity prices and volumes as well as the transfer of the export and domestic brokerage businesses to employees of those units 
the decrease in other revenues as a percentage of revenues during fiscal year is primarily attributable to divestitures made during the prior year 
fiscal year ended april  as reported collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling brokerage other total revenues we revised percentages of total revenues for fiscal year to conform with our classification of revenues attributable to services provided in fiscal year operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of production method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 except for accretion expense  we no longer accrue landfill retirement obligations through a charge to cost of operations  but rather as an increase to landfill assets which are amortized using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from our consolidated financial statements bear in relation to revenues 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of operations general and administration depreciation and amortization impairment charge restructuring charge operating income interest expense  net income from equity method investments loss on debt extinguishment other expense income  net and minority interest benefit provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the revenue increase is attributable to an increase in core solid waste revenues of million due to volume and price increases  and higher recycling volumes and prices which resulted in a net increase in recycling revenues of million 
loss of revenues from businesses divested amounted to million  partially offset by the roll over effect of businesses acquired of million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the dollar increase in cost of operations expenses is primarily due to the effect of acquired businesses and a net increase in material purchases resulting from higher recycling volumes  which were partially offset by lower commodity purchases resulting from the divestiture of the export and domestic brokerage business 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administrative costs was due to higher bad debt and travel costs associated with the development of new landfill capacity 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year depreciation expense was up million between periods and landfill amortization expense increased million which was primarily attributable to increased landfill volumes  the effect of newly acquired landfill operations and as a result of adopting sfas no 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year which resulted from the higher landfill amortization expense 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on variable rate debt in the current year  versus the prior period 
interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of a million write down of our investment in resource optimization technology rot  a compost facility  which we intend to transfer at no cost to the minority interest holder of rot  a charge of million relating to the sale of buildings and land at our former recycling facility in mechanics falls  maine  and a charge of million related to the discontinued rockingham landfill project 
income from equity method investments 
income from equity method investments for fiscal years and was solely from our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
equity income from greenfiber increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year equity income from greenfiber in fiscal year included a million gain associated with an eminent domain settlement received from a state department of transportation on the involuntary conversion of a portion of a greenfiber leased manufacturing facility 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in fiscal year  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the write off of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
minority interest 
minority interest in fiscal year reflects a minority owner s interest in our majority owned subsidiary  aart 
aart completed its ash operation contract and closed its operations in fiscal year other expense income  net 
other expense in fiscal year was million compared to other income of million in fiscal year due to an adverse court ruling involving a power plant in fort heights  illinois in which we own a joint venture interest and the exercise by a third party of an option to purchase our remaining interest in certain tire recycling operations  other expense in fiscal year includes an million charge for the write down of our investment in the tire recycling operation and the power plant venture 
offsetting this charge  we recognized a gain of million on the completion of our sale of its export recyclables business and other gains  primarily on the sale of trucks and containers  of million 
other income in fiscal was attributable to a gain of million related to a settlement with oakhurst company  inc  as well as a gain on the divestitures and other assets of million and a gain on the conclusion of the american ash recovery technologies aart contract of million  offset by a million charge for interest rate swap unwind costs 
benefit provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards in as utilization of tax losses is more certain  as well as  in  the nondeductible impairment of goodwill and nondeductible losses on business dispositions 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million in order to reflect the cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill was determined to be impaired and the amount of million net of tax benefit of million was charged to earnings in fiscal as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge was related to our waste to energy operation  maine energy  and the brokerage business of the fcr recycling segment  both of which were acquired as part of our acquisition of kti 
at the time of acquisition  we recorded the fair value of these businesses using an independent third party valuation 
the underlying assumptions used to establish the value of these businesses  including earnings projections  commodity pricing assumptions and industry valuation multiples for recycling products  were not realized 
accordingly  goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the net book value of these businesses exceeded their fair value 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year divested businesses accounted for a decrease of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by price and volume increases in the core solid waste business amounting to million  higher commodity prices and volumes amounting to million and the positive rollover effect of acquisitions amounting to approximately million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase arose mainly from higher insurance costs  partially offset by operating improvements in direct labor and lower commodity purchases resulting from the sale of the export brokerage business 
the increased insurance costs arose mainly from a negative actuarial adjustment of million related to our captive insurance company in fiscal versus a positive adjustment of million in fiscal general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in general and administration expenses was primarily the result of legal and insurance expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly attributable to our adopting sfas which eliminates recognition of goodwill amortization  partially offset by higher landfill amortization expense due to volume increases 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on variable rate debt in the current year  versus the prior period 
interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million to adjust the book value of the domestic brokerage and commercial recycling businesses to net realizable value 
income from equity method investments 
income from equity method investments in fiscal year of million reflects equity income in our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
equity income from greenfiber in fiscal year included a million gain associated with an eminent domain settlement received from a state department of transportation on the involuntary conversion of a portion of a greenfiber leased manufacturing facility 
income from equity method investments in fiscal year of million reflects equity income in our joint venture interest in greenfiber amounting to million  offset by a million loss related to our further investment in the new heights tire processing business 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in fiscal year  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the write off of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
minority interest 
this amount represented the minority owners interest in our majority owned subsidiary aart  which completed its ash operation contract and was dissolved in february other income expense  net 
other income was million in fiscal year compared to million in other expenses in fiscal year this decrease is attributable to the difference in gain on divestitures 
in addition there was a gain of million in fiscal year related to a settlement with oakhurst company  inc  offset by a million charge for interest rate swap unwind costs 
benefit provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards  nondeductible impairment of goodwill and the loss on the sale of a significant portion of our interest in new heights in fiscal year  partially offset by the decrease in nondeductible goodwill amortization  recognition of additional tax losses from new heights and the elimination of capital loss carryforwards 
reclassification from discontinued operations  net 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into negotiations with former employees for the transfer of our domestic brokerage operation and a commercial recycling business 
the commercial recycling business had been accounted for as a discontinued operation since fiscal year due to the nature of the transaction  we could not retain discontinued accounting treatment for this operation 
therefore the commercial recycling business has been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for fiscal years  and in fiscal year  we estimated and accrued for anticipated future losses from this business which were recorded and classified as losses from discontinued operations 
this amount has been reclassified and offset against actual losses from operations in fiscal years and estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net 
the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations for fiscal year is primarily due to the loss on the sale of the commercial recycling business 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill was determined to be impaired and the amount of million net of tax benefit of million was charged to earnings in fiscal year as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge was related to our waste to energy operation  maine energy  and the brokerage business of the fcr recycling segment  both of which were acquired as part of our acquisition of kti 
at the time of acquisition  we recorded the fair value of these businesses using an independent third party valuation 
the underlying assumptions used to establish the value of these businesses  including earnings projections  commodity pricing assumptions and industry valuation multiples for recycling products  were not realized 
accordingly  goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the net book value of these businesses exceeded their fair value 
in fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a charge to earnings as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million net of tax benefit of million for the portion of interest rate swap hedges determined to be ineffective 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction as well as site and cell closure 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  working capital  net comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factors accounting for the decrease were higher trade payable and accrual balances  partially offset by increases in trade receivables and higher levels of restricted cash 
we have a million credit facility with a group of banks for which fleet bank  na is acting as agent 
this credit facility consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior secured term b loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at april  we have the right to increase the amount of the revolver and or the term loan by an aggregate amount of up to million at our discretion  provided that we are not in default at the time of the increase  and subject to the receipt of commitments from lenders for such additional amount 
on august   we amended the terms of the term loan  lowering the borrowing rate and modifying the prepayment provisions to include a prepayment premium applicable to the first two years following the date of the amendment 
the term loan and revolving credit facility agreement contains covenants that may limit our activities  including covenants that restrict dividends and stock repurchases  limit capital expenditures  and set minimum net worth and profitability requirements and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of april   we considered the profitability covenant  which requires our cumulative adjusted net income for any two consecutive quarters to be positive  to be the most restrictive 
as of april   we were in compliance with this covenant as we reported consolidated adjusted net income of million for the six months ended april  consolidated adjusted net income is defined by the credit facility agreement 
in accordance with this definition  consolidated net income  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  is adjusted for elimination of certain nonrecurring charges  extraordinary gains  income from discontinued operations and non cash income attributable to equity investments 
on june   we amended the terms of the senior credit facility to clarify the definition of certain non recurring charges excluded from the covenant calculations in fiscal as of april   we had available borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility of up to million  subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions 
the available capacity of million is net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit of million 
this credit facility is secured by all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility matures in january and the term loan matures in january as of april   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes which mature in january the senior subordinated note agreement contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to higher income from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year decreased by million from in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the cash outflows from landfill closure activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a higher level of acquisitions  payments under landfill operating lease contracts  capital expenditures and advances to unconsolidated entities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities reflected mainly lower proceeds from divestitures and an increase in acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher net borrowings  lower outlays on deferred financing costs and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash used in financing activities of in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to paying down less debt  net of borrowings  than in fiscal year  partially offset by refinancing costs of million 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to existing landfills and newly acquired landfill operating contracts 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to the upgrade of the truck fleet and facilities 
we expect capital spending to amount to between million and million in fiscal year the expected increase is due to capital expenditures at the newly acquired landfills 
in fiscal year  we acquired ten solid waste hauling operations and one construction and demolition processing facility  which also operates a landfill facility under an operating lease contract  in transactions accounted for as purchases  for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in other consideration 
we also acquired two landfill operating lease contracts 
for the three new landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million 
during fiscal year  we completed eight acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and other consideration 
in comparison  during fiscal year  we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and other consideration 
in fiscal year  we completed our previously announced divestiture program which was announced in march  from which we received total consideration of million  including cash proceeds of million which were used to reduce our indebtedness 
we intend to use the additional availability under our revolving credit facility to support our acquisition program 
as of june   we were negotiating an operating agreement in connection with the kness landfill in sergeant  pennsylvania owned by the mckean county solid waste authority 
the closing of the mckean county transaction is subject to normal contingencies and there can be no assurances that we will enter into that agreement 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations interest obligations operating leases closure post closure redeemable preferred securities total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on long term debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
assumes redemption on the seventh anniversary of the closing date at the book value which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year we believe that our cash provided internally from operations together with our senior secured credit facilities should enable us to meet our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was adopted effective may  through april  we recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of production basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of capitalized and future landfill capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs historically have not taken into account discounts for the present value of costs to be paid in the future 
under sfas no 
 our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated by to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid 
these estimated costs are then discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
under sfas no 
 we no longer accrue landfill retirement obligations through a charge to cost of operations  but rather by an increase to landfill assets 
under sfas no 
 the amortizable landfill assets include not only the landfill development costs incurred but also the recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities  as well as the cost estimates for future capping  closure and post closure costs 
the landfill asset is amortized over the total capacity of the landfill  as airspace is consumed during the life of the landfill with one exception 
the exception is for capping for which both the recognition of the liability and the amortization of these costs are based instead on the airspace consumed for the specific capping event 
upon adoption  sfas no 
required a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
to do this  sfas no 
required the creation of the related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization  and an adjustment to the capping  closure and post closure liability for cumulative accretion 
at may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
the following is a summary of the balance sheet changes for landfill assets and capping  closure and post closure liabilities at may  in thousands balance at april  change balance at may  landfill assets accumulated amortization net landfill assets capping  closure  and post closure liabilities the following table shows the activity and total balances related to accruals for capping  closure and post closure from april  to april  in thousands balance at april  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle capping  closure  and post closure liability  adjusted obligations incurred revisions in estimates accretion expense payments acquisitions and other adjustments balance at april  upon adoption of sfas no 
 on may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended april   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections was issued in april  and among other things  restricts the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary such that most debt extinguishment gains and losses are no longer classified as extraordinary 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  upon adoption  gains and losses on future debt extinguishment  if any  will be recorded in pre tax income 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million net of income tax benefit of million in connection with the write off of deferred financing costs related to the old term loan and the old revolver 
this item was reclassified to continuing operations in the financial statements as loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of million 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas was issued by the fasb in december this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used in reporting results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the required disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements note o 
fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
was issued by the fasb in december in january  the fasb issued fin  which requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb revised fin to provide companies with clarification of key terms  additional exemptions for application and an extended initial application period 
fin is currently effective for all variable interest entities created or modified after january  and special purpose entities created on or before january  the fasb s december revision to fin makes the interpretation effective for all other variable interests beginning march  the adoption of fin had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity was issued by the fasb in may the statement changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
the new statement requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after june   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
effective august  in november  the fasb issued an fsp delaying the effective date for certain instruments and entities 
sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our increased leverage may restrict our future operations and impact our ability to make future acquisitions 
our indebtedness has substantially increased 
the payment of interest and principal due under this indebtedness has reduced  and may continue to reduce  funds available for other business purposes  including capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  the aggregate amount of indebtedness has limited and may continue to limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and thereby may limit our acquisition program 
we may not be successful in making acquisitions of solid waste assets  including developing additional disposal capacity  or in integrating acquired businesses or assets  which could limit our future growth 
our strategy envisions that a substantial part of our future growth will come from making acquisitions of traditional solid waste assets or operations and acquiring or developing additional disposal capacity 
these acquisitions may include tuck in acquisitions within our existing markets  assets that are adjacent to or outside our existing markets  or larger  more strategic acquisitions 
in addition  from time to time we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
if we identify suitable acquisition candidates  we may be unable to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a favorable price or on favorable terms and conditions 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval to complete potential acquisitions 
our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from acquisitions  including cost savings and operating efficiencies  depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
the integration of acquired businesses and other assets may require significant management time and company resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing management of our existing operations 
in addition  the process of acquiring  developing and permitting additional disposal capacity is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
for example  we are currently involved in litigation with the town of bethlehem  new hampshire relating to the expansion of a landfill owned by our wholly owned subsidiary  north country environmental services  inc moreover  the disposal capacity at our existing landfills is limited by the remaining available volume at our landfills and annual and or daily disposal limits imposed by the various governmental authorities with jurisdiction over our landfills 
we typically reach or approximate our daily and annual maximum permitted disposal capacity at all of our landfills 
if we are unable to develop or acquire additional disposal capacity  our ability to achieve economies from the internalization of our waste stream will be limited and we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce our revenues and or our operating margins 
although we have recently entered into several landfill operating lease contracts and have announced that we are the successful bidder for the negotiation of an operating agreement for the mckean county landfill in pennsylvania  there can be no assurance that any or all of these landfill management contracts will result in successful operations at the respective sites or that the landfill projects will receive all necessary permits 
we recently experienced a delay with respect to our landfill management contract in templeton  massachusetts as a result of the town s adoption of by laws prohibiting the acceptance of out of town waste 
our ability to make acquisitions is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of our stock price 
we anticipate that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities  the issuance of shares of our class a common stock and or seller financing 
we may not have sufficient existing capital resources and may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital resources on satisfactory terms  if at all  in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions 
we also believe that a significant factor in our ability to close acquisitions will be the attractiveness to us and to persons selling businesses to us of our class a common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of our class a common stock compared to the equity securities of our competitors 
the trading price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq national market has limited our willingness to use our equity as consideration and the willingness of sellers to accept our shares and as a result has limited  and could continue to limit  the size and scope of our acquisition program 
environmental regulations and litigation could subject us to fines  penalties  judgments and limitations on our ability to expand 
we are subject to potential liability and restrictions under environmental laws  including those relating to transport  recycling  treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  discharges to air and water  and the remediation of contaminated soil  surface water and groundwater 
the waste management industry has been and will continue to be subject to regulation  including permitting and related financial assurance requirements  as well as to attempts to further regulate the industry through new legislation 
our waste to energy facility is subject to regulations limiting discharges of pollution into the air and water  and our solid waste operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state and  in some cases  local environmental  odor and noise and land use restrictions 
for example  our waste to energy facility in biddeford  maine is affected by zoning restrictions and air emissions limitations in our efforts to implement a new odor control system 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements that apply to a particular facility or if we operate without necessary approvals  we could be subject to civil  and possibly criminal  fines and penalties  and we may be required to spend substantial capital to bring an operation into compliance or to temporarily or permanently discontinue  and or take corrective actions  possibly including removal of landfilled materials  regarding an operation that is not permitted under the law 
we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for our environmental liabilities 
those costs or actions could be significant and impact our results of operations  as well as our available capital 
environmental and land use laws also impact our ability to expand and  in the case of our solid waste operations  may dictate those geographic areas from which we must  or  from which we may not  accept waste 
those laws and regulations may limit the overall size and daily waste volume that may be accepted by a solid waste operation 
if we are not able to expand or otherwise operate one or more of our facilities because of limits imposed under environmental laws  we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce our revenues and or operating margins 
we have historically grown and intend to continue to grow through acquisitions  and we have tried and will continue to try to evaluate and address environmental risks and liabilities presented by newly acquired businesses as we have identified them 
it is possible that some liabilities  including ones that may exist only because of the past operations of an acquired business  may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than we anticipate 
it is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we would expect  or that we will fail to identify or fully appreciate an existing liability before we become legally responsible to address it 
some of the legal sanctions to which we could become subject could cause us to lose a needed permit  or prevent us from or delay us in obtaining or renewing permits to operate our facilities or harm our reputation 
our operating program depends on our ability to operate and expand the landfills we own and lease and to develop new landfill sites 
localities where we operate generally seek to regulate some or all landfill operations  including siting and expansion of operations 
the laws adopted by municipalities in which our landfills are located may limit or prohibit the expansion of the landfill as well as the amount and origin of waste that we can accept at the landfill on a daily or annual basis and any effort to acquire or expand landfills typically involves a significant amount of time and expense 
for example  expansion at our north county environmental services landfill  outside the original acres  will be prohibited as a result of a recent decision by the new hampshire supreme court unless we prevail in certain remanded issues under zoning laws or the town revises its local ordinance prohibiting expansions 
expansion of our hyland landfill is subject to the passage of a town wide referendum  and operation of the templeton landfill will require repeal of a town by law prohibiting the acceptance of out of town waste 
we may not be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of our current landfills once their remaining disposal capacity has been consumed 
if we are unable to develop additional disposal capacity  our ability to achieve economies from the internalization of our wastestream will be limited and we will be required to utilize the disposal facilities of our competitors 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  we incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by governmental agencies and private parties 
we are  and also may be in the future  a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage  personal injury  and or property damage 
for example  we are one of over twenty defendants named in a toxic tort lawsuit filed on july  by residents surrounding three sites in cheektowaga  new york alleging  among other things  that we have liability as a result of our airspace agreement at the schultz construction and demolition debris landfill 
our operations would be adversely affected if we do not have access to sufficient capital 
our ability to remain competitive and sustain our operations depends in part on cash flow from operations and our access to capital 
we intend to fund our cash needs primarily through cash from operations and borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations and to fund our growth and operations 
in addition  if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  our capital requirements may increase 
we may not have access to the amount of capital that we require from time to time  on favorable terms or at all 
our results of operations could continue to be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by changing purchase or resale prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
our recycling business involves the purchase and sale of recyclable materials  some of which are priced on a commodity basis 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials  particularly waste paper  plastic and ferrous and aluminum metals  can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control 
although we seek to limit our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices through the use of hedging agreements and long term supply contracts with customers  these changes have in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to significant variability in our period to period results of operations 
our business is geographically concentrated and is therefore subject to regional economic downturns 
our operations and customers are principally located in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to regional economic downturns and other regional factors  including state regulations and budget constraints and severe weather conditions 
in addition  as we expand in our existing markets  opportunities for growth within these regions will become more limited and the geographic concentration of our business will increase 
maine energy may be required to make a payment in connection with the payoff of certain obligations and limited partner loans earlier than we had anticipated and which may exceed the amount of the liability we recorded in connection with the kti acquisition 
under the terms of waste handling agreements among the biddeford saco waste handling committee  the cities of biddeford and saco  maine  other municipalities and our subsidiary maine energy  maine energy will be required  following the date on which the bonds that financed maine energy and certain limited partner loans to maine energy are paid in full  to pay a residual cancellation payment to the respective municipalities party to those agreements equal to an aggregate of of the fair market value of the equity of the partners in maine energy 
in connection with our merger with kti  we estimated the fair market value of maine energy as of the date the limited partner loans are anticipated to be paid in full  and recorded a liability equal to of such amount 
our estimate of the fair market value of maine energy may not prove to be accurate  and in the event we have underestimated the value of maine energy  we could be required to recognize unanticipated charges  in which case our operating results could be harmed 
in connection with these waste handling agreements  the cities of biddeford and saco and the additional municipalities that were parties to the agreements have filed lawsuits in the state of maine seeking the residual cancellation payments and alleging  among other things  our breach of the waste handling agreement for our failure to pay the residual cancellation payments in connection with the kti merger  failure to pay off limited partner loans in accordance with the terms of the agreement and processing amounts of waste above contractual limits without issuance of proper notice 
the complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and a court order requiring us to provide an accounting of all relevant transactions since may  if the plaintiffs are successful in their claims against us and damages are awarded  our operating income in the period in which such a claim is paid would be impacted 
we may not be able to effectively compete in the highly competitive solid waste services industry 
the solid waste services industry is highly competitive  has undergone a period of rapid consolidation and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
some of the markets in which we compete or will likely compete are served by one or more of the large national or multinational solid waste companies  as well as numerous regional and local solid waste companies 
intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers  but also to acquire other businesses within each market 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than us 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid contract 
these practices may either require us to reduce the pricing of our services or result in our loss of business 
as is generally the case in the industry  some municipal contracts are subject to periodic competitive bidding 
we may not be the successful bidder to obtain or retain these contracts 
if we are unable to compete with larger and better capitalized companies  or to replace municipal contracts lost through the competitive bidding process with comparable contracts or other revenue sources within a reasonable time period  our revenues would decrease and our operating results would be harmed 
in our solid waste disposal markets we also compete with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities and with counties  municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection  recycling and disposal operations 
these entities may have financial advantages because user fees or similar charges  tax revenues and tax exempt financing may be more available to them than to us 
our greenfiber insulation manufacturing joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation competes with other parties  principally national manufacturers of fiberglass insulation  which have substantially greater resources than greenfiber does  which they could use for product development  marketing or other purposes to our detriment 
our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we inadequately accrue for capping  closure and post closure costs 
we have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
once the permitted capacity of a particular landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized  the landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance started 
we establish reserves for the estimated costs associated with such capping  closure and post closure obligations over the anticipated useful life of each landfill on a per ton basis 
in addition to the landfills we currently operate  we own six unlined landfills  which are not currently in operation 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our owned or operated landfills  the latter generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a circumstance could result in significant unanticipated charges 
fluctuations in fuel costs could affect our operating expenses and results 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control  including among others  geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns 
because fuel is needed to run our fleet of trucks  price escalations for fuel increase our operating expenses 
during fiscal  we used approximately million gallons of diesel fuel in our solid waste operations 
although many of our customer contracts permit the company to pass on some or all fuel increases to our customers  we may choose not to do so for competitive reasons 
we could be precluded from entering into contracts or obtaining permits if we are unable to obtain third party financial assurance to secure our contractual obligations 
public solid waste collection  recycling and disposal contracts  obligations associated with landfill closure and the operation and closure of waste to energy facilities may require performance or surety bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary financial assurance in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates  we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal solid waste collection contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill management contracts or operating permits 
any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon the contractor having adequate insurance coverage 
we may be required to write off capitalized charges or intangible assets in the future  which could harm our earnings 
any write off of capitalized costs or intangible assets reduces our earnings and  consequently  could affect the market price of our class a common stock 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to our acquisitions  pending acquisitions  landfills and development projects 
from time to time in future periods  we may be required to incur a charge against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances  net of any portion thereof that we estimate will be recoverable  through sale or otherwise  relating to any operation that is permanently shut down or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow  any pending acquisition that is not consummated  any landfill or development project that is not expected to be successfully completed  and any goodwill or other intangible assets that are determined to be impaired 
we have incurred such charges in the past 
our revenues and our operating income experience seasonal fluctuations 
our transfer and disposal revenues have historically been lower during the months of november through march 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the late fall  winter and early spring months primarily because the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern united states  and decreased tourism in vermont  maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers  which is partially offset by increased volume from the winter ski industry 
since certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year  operating income is therefore impacted by a similar seasonality 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions typically result in increased operating costs to our operations 
our recycling business experiences increased volumes of newspaper in november and december due to increased newspaper advertising and retail activity during the holiday season 
our cellulose insulation joint venture experiences lower sales in november and december because of lower production of manufactured housing due to holiday plant shutdowns 
efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses 
labor unions regularly make attempts to organize our employees  and these efforts will likely continue in the future 
certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these groups 
additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future  and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions  our revenues could decrease and our operating expenses could increase  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of june   approximately of our employees involved in collection  transfer  disposal  recycling or other operations  including our employees at our maine energy waste to energy facility  were represented by unions 
our class b common stock has ten votes per share and is held exclusively by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella 
the holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and the holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
at june   an aggregate of  shares of our class b common stock  representing  votes  were outstanding  all of which were beneficially owned by john w 
casella  our chairman and chief executive officer  or by his brother  douglas r 
casella  a member of our board of directors 
based on the number of shares of common stock and series a redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding on june   the shares of our class a common stock and class b common stock beneficially owned by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella represent approximately of the aggregate voting power of our stockholders 
consequently  john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella are able to substantially influence all matters for stockholder consideration 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at april   our outstanding variable rate debt consisted of the million term loan portion of our new senior secured credit facility 
if interest rates on this variable rate debt increased or decreased by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
in addition  the revolving credit facility portion of our new senior secured credit facility  as it may be outstanding from time to time  is variable rate debt 
the remainder of our debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
on february   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with two banks  effectively fixing the interest index rate on a notional million at approximately 
these agreements are specifically designated to existing interest payments under the term loan and are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
the fair value of the swaps is estimated at a loss of million as of april  we are subject to commodity price fluctuations related to the portion of our sales of recyclable commodities that are not under floor or flat pricing arrangements 
as of april   to minimize our commodity exposure  we were party to twenty two commodity hedging agreements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
if commodity prices were to change by  the impact on our operating margin is estimated at million as of april   without considering our hedging agreements 
the effect of the hedge position would reduce the impact by approximately million 
on december   enron corporation enron  the counterparty for all of our commodity hedges as of that date  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
as a result of the filing  we executed the early termination provisions provided under the forward contracts  and filed a claim with the bankruptcy court 
additionally  we agreed with our equity method investee  greenfiber  to include greenfiber in our claim as allowed under the applicable affiliate provisions 
we recorded a charge of million in fiscal other expense to recognize the change in fair value of our commodity contracts 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these commodity contracts were reflected in earnings until their march termination 
we have no remaining exposure related to our claims against enron
