item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  we are proud to report that was another year of record financial performance for us  on the heels of a that  until this year  had been our best performing year ever 
our basic measures of financial performance were up across the board in over on a gaap basis  net income increased by  to million  or per share  from million  or per share 
net revenues increased by  to million from million in overall stockholders equity surged  to million a per share book value of from million a per share book value of 
because we settled our september th related property damage insurance claim in and our september th related business interruption insurance claim in  both years results included significant one time benefits related to these settlements 
for  this after tax benefit net of september th related expenses was million  or 
per share  principally recorded during our third quarter 
for  this net after tax benefit was million  or 
per share  principally recorded during our fourth quarter 
reflecting the overall strength of our financial performance  as well as the change in the tax treatment of corporate dividends  we declared and paid our first ever quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of at a rate of 
per share for an anticipated annual dividend of 
per share 
our goal as a company is to maintain and build on our track record over the last three years of consistent profitability  quarter in and quarter out  and build up stockholders equity  while at the same time providing our stockholders with a meaningful  tax efficient current return through our dividend policy 
we also recognize that the nature of the markets in which we participate is likely to cause significant fluctuations up or down in our financial results for any given quarter 
thus  although every quarter in was profitable extending a run of thirteen consecutive quarters of profitability our financial performance was strongest during our first three quarters and flattened out somewhat during our fourth quarter 
historically  because of fewer trading days and often quieter markets  the fourth quarter is usually our biggest challenge 
the performance of our core euro brokers inter dealer brokerage businesses is highly dependent on the volumes of trading activity in the various products that we broker 
for example  volatility in interest rates  and a steeper yield curve  are usually positives for generating more trading activity  regardless of whether the interest rate trend is up or down 
continuing the pattern of recent years  most of saw reasonably strong levels of trading activity in the fixed income and derivatives markets in which we are active 
through an emphasis on retaining our key employees with the strongest client relationships  we generally were able to maintain or build our market share in key products  with one or two exceptions 
as a result  our euro brokers businesses  overall  continued to perform well 
in new york  our largest departments cash deposits  interest rate derivatives and repurchase agreements all produced solid returns  and our new effort in the brokerage of us treasuries  started in late  continued to grow and improve in performance 
london was a particular bright spot 
there  we were able to increase revenues on nearly all of our inter dealer brokerage desks  as well as improve our market position in several as well 
we also benefited from owning of those operations from late february forward  the result of winning a lawsuit against our former partner there that permitted us to buy their shareholdings at a significant discount to book value 
overall  revenues in london increased by more than inclusive of the impact of exchange rates  and net income not including the extraordinary gain from this discounted acquisition almost quadrupled 
our tokyo operations  on the other hand  continued to struggle  as a restructuring that attempted to switch our brokers there to higher incentive payouts and lower base salaries failed to gain traction  even as derivatives market activity in japan began to pick up 
in late  we assigned a new full time manager to the operations and moved the overall supervision to our london center  where the time zone is more closely aligned to tokyo s 
we also recently upgraded the office s infrastructure  including the installation of new telephone equipment 
although these operations have not yet returned to profitability  we saw their losses narrow by more than during our fourth quarter  and that improvement is continuing so far into early in addition to tending to and continuously seeking to improve our euro brokers inter dealer brokerage businesses  we focused strongly in on building and expanding our maxcor institutional sales and trading businesses 
in our equity group  we added our first research analysts in order to complement a sales and trading operation that was consistently top ranked in for execution quality 
our municipal securities group  which has been operating successfully since  maintained its strong performance by focusing on special situations and providing top quality research  particularly in the hospital and healthcare arena 
our institutional convertible securities operation  started at the very end of  settled in and performed steadily  although it still needs to gain critical mass 
we also added an institutional securities financing operation in mid  pursuant to which we operate a matched book of repurchase agreements 
this business not only provides an opportunity to generate net spread revenue  but also provides us with the capability to reduce the costs of processing and financing securities positions from our other sales and trading businesses 
our most uneven performer among the maxcor businesses was our leveraged finance group  which specialized in high yield and distressed debt 
while showing pockets of strength  this group suffered the whole year under the cloud of taking more than million in first quarter losses on its when issued trading contracts in the equity of ntl  inc ntl  at the time a chapter debtor 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  in january ntl emerged from bankruptcy under a plan of reorganization providing for the issuance of one fourth the number of shares that had previously been contemplated during the when issued trading period 
our traders  and other participants in the when issued trading market  expected the settlement of their ntl trades would be adjusted to reflect what ntl had intended to be a neutral transaction  with the same effects as a for reverse stock split 
however  a number of buyers of ntl when issued shares either retained delivery of the full  unadjusted number of shares or  alternatively  demanded compensation for the remaining unadjusted number of shares not delivered to them 
in february  we initiated litigation in new york state supreme court  naming all of our ntl trading counterparties as defendants  in order to try to force an adjusted and uniform settlement of our ntl when issued trades that would be permanent we had previously obtained temporary relief  on an emergency application  from the bankruptcy court administering ntl s reorganization 
following our lead  two parallel ntl related suits were also filed in this court  bringing to almost fifty the number of counterparties before the court seeking a resolution of this dispute 
we then moved for summary judgment in our case  with many of the parties in our suit and the two related suits joining in our motion 
very recently  on march   the court granted our summary judgment motion in this matter  holding that all ntl trades should settle as we believed to be correct  that is  on an adjusted and uniform basis 
that decision  however  remains subject to the entry of a final order implementing its terms and possible appeal 
accordingly  we do not intend to reverse any of the losses previously taken except to the extent that we achieve a final resolution  whether by mutual consent  appeal or otherwise  with any of the counterparties with whom we traded 
since the court s decision  one such final resolution has already been achieved  and will result in our recording a  pre tax benefit in the first quarter of below expected performance  combined with the tensions generated by the ntl matter  contributed to the departure of the key members of our leveraged finance group in early january as a result  the remaining leveraged finance warrants were cancelled 
we took the opportunity to restructure the group entirely  and brought in a new manager 
going forward  our focus will be more on corporate bond sales and trading  with a high grade bond effort added to our previous high yield presence 
to date in  we have rapidly ramped up this area  hiring more than a dozen new traders and salespersons 
we intend to keep growing this area aggressively  with the expectation that it will begin covering its costs and making a positive contribution to profit by the second half of although we are now incurring initial higher costs associated with its growth  we believe that the maxcor institutional sales and trading businesses provide some important diversity to our overall mix of operations 
in particular  we are looking to these businesses both to create positive contributions to revenues and earnings and to expand our client base beyond that of our euro brokers businesses 
we continued in to allocate portions of our capital to support principal transactions in which we assume market risk for a period of time 
this trading occurred primarily in our maxcor municipal securities and leveraged finance groups  but also in our firm investment account 
in  it will also occur in our restructured corporate bond businesses  and generally will include hedging the corporate bond positions with treasuries or other bonds to minimize our risk exposure 
to support our maxcor sales and trading operations in  we contributed an additional million in capital to our broker dealer thereby raising its total capital to in excess of million 
this strengthening enabled us to upgrade to dealer membership status with gsd ficc and facilitated our ability to deploy risk capital selectively as opportunities arose 
the additional capital was primarily financed by a new million  secured reducing credit facility obtained from the bank of new york bony in march  which replaced an existing million line with general electric capital corporation gecc 
in november  the bony facility was converted at our request into a fixed million credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also increased our available cash and capital earlier in the year by financing with gecc  through various sale and leaseback arrangements that are treated as operating leases  approximately million in various phone and computer equipment purchased to outfit our new headquarters in new york 
our move in february to those new headquarters  on two floors at one seaport plaza in lower manhattan  was a huge step forward for our business and our employees 
after more than months in temporary headquarters following the september th terrorist attacks  we once again had a permanent home 
moreover  the move and rebuilding of our office space provided us with an opportunity to deploy state of the art infrastructure and equipment  while also building in ample room for expansion 
for example  the offices contain the latest in telecommunications and networking equipment  making it easy and cost effective to add new  or expand existing  brokerage and trading desks 
we believe this is a clear competitive advantage in recruiting new employees and business groups 
our build out at our new premises was substantially funded by our property insurance coverage  underwritten by kemper insurance companies kemper  which ultimately paid us the policy s full aggregate limit of approximately million 
our claim under that coverage was fully settled in late  resulting in a one time after tax net gain  as mentioned above  of approximately million 
after experiencing september th and its aftermath  we as a firm are firmly convinced that doing good  while doing well  is an essential part of who we are  as well as an important motivational force for our employees 
accordingly  in may we established the maxcor foundation  to serve as our broader charitable giving arm  in supplementation of our euro brokers relief fund  whose charter was limited to providing aid to our families who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks 
on may   we held our second annual charity day  in which all of our brokerage revenues are donated to these two entities 
with the full support of our customers and our employees  who waived any entitlement to commissions from the revenues generated that day  we were able to raise almost million 
we are very proud of these results and will be holding our third annual charity day this year on april th 
organizations that will be funded by the maxcor foundation this year include the marine corps law enforcement foundation  columbia university s college of physicians and surgeons  duke university s fuqua coach k center for leadership and ethics  and the royal marsden hospital in london 
the year also saw the continuation of our common stock repurchase program  which  in addition to the initiation of our dividend policy  is a key component of our overall effort to increase value to stockholders and intelligently manage our capital structure 
in total  we repurchased  shares in  at an aggregate cost of million 
these repurchases more than offset dilution from stock option exercises during the year  which  net of shares delivered in connection with such exercises  resulted in the issuance of  shares see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements details the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of those statements 
there are certain of these policies that are considered to be of particular importance because they require difficult  complex or subjective judgments on matters that are often inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
securities and trading contracts are carried at fair values generally based on quoted market prices 
from time to time quoted market prices are not available for certain municipal or other securities positions 
for such securities  we  with the assistance of independent pricing services  determine fair values by analyzing securities with similar characteristics that have quoted market prices 
consideration is given to the size of our individual positions relative to the overall market activity in such positions when determining the impact our sale would have on fair values 
since uncertainties may exist as to the settlement of when issued equity trading contracts  we defer any gains resulting from adjusting the costs of these contracts to fair values until uncertainties relating to settlement are resolved 
the assumptions used in valuing our securities and trading contracts may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reserves for certain contingencies to which we may have exposure  such as the employer portion of national insurance contributions in the uk  interest and claims on securities settlement disputes  such as the ntl matter  and reserves for certain income tax contingencies 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on our part 
we consider many factors in determining the amount of these reserves  such as legal precedent and case law and historic experience 
the assumptions used in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual costs of resolution of these items could be greater or less than the reserve amount

as of december   we had purchased  shares under this expanded program 
as has been the case with each of our repurchase program authorizations  all purchases of shares are subject to the availability of shares at prices which are acceptable to us  as well as to our assessment of prevailing market and business conditions  and  accordingly  there is no guarantee as to the timing or number of shares to be repurchased 
all purchases are anticipated to be funded using our existing resources

however  to the extent inflation increases certain of our operating expenses  such as employee compensation  travel and entertainment  occupancy and communication costs  such increases may not be readily recoverable in the price of our services  particularly for operations domiciled outside the united states  where there are increased inflationary pressures 
in addition  to the extent inflation increases or decreases volatility in the securities markets  our brokerage business is likely to be affected by corresponding increases or decreases in brokerage transaction volumes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are actively involved in the evaluation of risks associated with certain financial instruments and will from time to time reduce other risks inherent in our businesses through the use of financial instruments 
we reduce market risk related to positions in our institutional sales and trading operations by placing guidelines on their size  rating and number of days held and with certain hedging requirements 
we closely monitor our securities positions on a real time basis  including comparisons to independently verified market values 
we perform daily reviews of activity reports for all sales and trading operations which detail all executed transactions and resulting commissions and principal gains and losses 
we reduce market risk in our institutional securities financing business by placing guidelines on the matching of maturity dates for offsetting reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements 
we review reports daily detailing all outstanding reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements  including the collateral securing the financing  the counterparty  interest rate  start date and maturity date 
in the process of executing brokerage transactions  we sometimes experience out trades or other errors in which we may have liability for the resulting unmatched position 
out trades generally increase with increases in the volatility of the market 
if an out trade is promptly discovered  thereby allowing prompt correction or disposition of the unmatched position  our risk is usually limited 
if discovery or correction or disposition is delayed  the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening market movements prior to such correction or disposition 
we believe that both our paperless confirmation system and our electronic blotter system  because of their ability to confirm trade details rapidly and identify unbalanced trade conditions as they occur  serve to help limit the market risk exposure when out trades or other errors occur 
to limit our exposure further in such situations  our policy is to correct or dispose of any resulting unmatched positions promptly after their discovery 
for our non trading activities we do not consider our exposure to fixed interest rates significant at december   due to the low level of debt outstanding 
any borrowings under the facility with bony bear interest at variable rates 
we will monitor the level of borrowings under the bony facility as well as the interest rate environment to determine the necessity of a hedging strategy to guard against increases in market interest rates 
the tables below provide information  at each of december  and december   about our financial instruments that are used either for trading purposes or other than trading purposes and that are sensitive to either changes in interest rates or changes in foreign exchange rates 
except as noted above  our market risk analysis at december  did not materially change from the market risk analysis at december  for the revolving credit facility  the table presents principal cash flows with expected maturity dates
