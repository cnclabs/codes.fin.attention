as a regulated company  nisource is exposed to regulatory risk 
currently  nisource is in discussions with various regulatory bodies 
this past year  nisource implemented several creative agreements by working collaboratively with regulators and other key stakeholders  which provided value for our customers and shareholders

columbia gas of ohio  inc columbia of ohio offers one of the most successful gas utility choice programs in the nation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
however  the ohio regulators have recently decided to modify parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the customer choice sm program and provide columbia of ohio customers rate certainty 
the company is likely to seek rehearing on the components that have been modified 
columbia gas of pennsylvania  inc cpa received regulatory approval in october to recover certain costs of an affordable payment plan to low income gas customers with long term bill payment problems 
this agreement should reduce cpa s arrearages and bad debt write offs going forward

all regulatory matters are discussed in the segments section of the management discussion and analysis 
nisource has had many accomplishments in the current and recent years 
the divestiture of major non core businesses  which allowed nisource to reduce debt and business risk  and focus on the core  regulated assets  and the reduction of the dividend in november has helped nisource affirm its investment grade credit rating with a stable outlook 
in addition nisource reduced interest expense during by million as compared to last year  or percent  by retiring billion in debt and reissuing another billion of debt at a lower rate 
nisource also downsized the revolving credit facility by million and retired million in mandatory redeemable preferred securities  which further reduced fixed charges

market risk disclosures risk is an inherent part of nisource s energy businesses 
the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability 
nisource seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal trading and non trading risks that are involved in nisource s energy businesses commodity market risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
risk management at nisource is a multi faceted process with committee oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
nisource s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
business  nisource s risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor nisource s market and credit risks  including value at risk and instrument sensitivity to market factors var 
var represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
non trading risks commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries is limited  since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power  fuel and gas costs through the rate making process 
if states should explore additional regulatory reform  these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 
effective july   tpc sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio  physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party 
beginning with the effective date of the sale  the primary remaining operations associated with tpc include commercial and industrial gas sales including arranging supply  power marketing and gas supply associated with nisource s single merchant cogeneration facility and power trading

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit  which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
at december   the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled million 
nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt 
the principal amount of such long term debt subject to interest rate hedges at december  was  million 
based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during and  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by million and million for the years and  respectively

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
due to the nature of the industry  credit risk is a factor in many of nisource s business activities 
credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer  supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date 
for derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps  credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms 
exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure 
current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes  such as commitments  standby letters of credit and guarantees 
because many of nisource s exposures vary with changes in market prices  nisource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices 
in determining exposure  nisource considers collateral and master netting agreements  which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk 
trading risks prior to the july  sale of the tpc gas marketing and trading contracts  nisource s trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities 
beginning july   with the exception of one remaining gas trading transaction  which expired in october  the trading activities of tpc have involved power only 
the transactions associated with nisource s power trading operations give rise to various risks  including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity 
the power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards 
fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction 
fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity 
the current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the new york mercantile exchange nymex  other external sources including electronic exchanges and over the counter broker dealer markets  as well as financial models such as the black scholes option pricing model

the caption prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on electronic exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information 
contracts shown within prices based on models other method are generally valued employing the widely used black scholes option pricing model 
market risk measurement market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio 
nisource calculates a one day var at a confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variance covariance methodology 
based on the results of the var analysis  the daily market exposure for power trading on an average  high and low basis was million  million and effectively zero  during  respectively 
the daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average  high and low basis was million  million and million during  respectively 
prospectively  management has set the var limits at million for power trading and million for gas marketing 
exceeding the var limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk

off balance sheet arrangements nisource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately billion of commodity related payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary 
these guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity 
to the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees  such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets

other information critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had  and may continue to have  significant impacts on nisource s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
basis of accounting for rate regulated subsidiaries 
sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates  if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 
certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were million and  million at december   and million and million at december   respectively 
additionally  refer to sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations under this item heading titled  accounting changes and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future  all or a portion of nisource s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 
in such event  a write down of all or a portion of nisource s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period  the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts 
if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 nisource would be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
in management s opinion  nisource s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates 
although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed  nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 
regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to million at december  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable  a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 
accounting for risk management activities 
under sfas no 
 as amended  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income  earnings  or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives 
for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks 
for fair value hedges  the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item 
as a result of the rate making process  the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective 
the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter  throughout the period that the hedge is designated 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 
although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges  the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high 
nisource generally uses nymex exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses 
nisource had million of price risk management assets and million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to hedges at december  the amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was million at december  accounting for energy trading activities 
energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices 
nisource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under sfas no 
through  contracts not meeting the criteria under sfas no 
were recorded at fair value under emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities eitf no 

pursuant to eitf no 
 when certain trading criteria are met  energy contracts  including energy related contracts such as tolling  transportation and storage contracts  should be accounted for at fair value marked to market along with any related derivative contracts  recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings 
in the october eitf meeting  eitf no 
was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in sfas no 
can be marked to market 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further information 
while the assessment of fair values for nisource s trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts  transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models 
no estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of december  due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year 
in addition  power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used black scholes option pricing model 
at december   the fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of million 
at december   nisource s balance sheet contained million of price risk management assets and million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities  respectively 
pensions and postretirement benefits 
nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the plans are accounted for under sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value  long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity  among other assumptions 
due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities  changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition

effective january   nisource adopted the fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  or b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january   resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately million  which was recognized in earnings during and the adoption also resulted in the recognition of million of assets and million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of million 
eitf issue no 
issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities and eitf issue no 
accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
on october   the eitf reached a final consensus in eitf no 
that gains and losses realized or unrealized on all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no 
should be shown net in the income statement  whether or not settled physically  if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
for purposes of the consensus  energy trading activities encompass contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on  or exposure to  shifts in market prices 
this consensus was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  upon implementation of eitf no 
in  nisource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the provisions of the consensus 
eitf no 
implementation resulted in equal and offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of million   million and  million for the years ended december   and respectively 
accordingly  nisource s operating income remained unchanged for all periods presented 
sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
nisource adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january   and as a result an asset retirement obligations liability of million was recognized  of which was related to assets sold in in addition  nisource capitalized million in additions to plant assets  net of accumulated amortization  of which million was related to assets sold in  and recognized regulatory assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
nisource believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in future rates 
the cumulative after tax effect of adopting sfas no 
amounted to million 
certain costs of removal that have been  and continue to be  included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the rate regulated subsidiaries  did not meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation pursuant to sfas no 
the amount of the other costs of removal was approximately billion at december  and december  based on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates 
nisource reclassified its cost of removal as of december  from accumulated depreciation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance sheet and upon adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of december  for the twelve months ended december   nisource recognized accretion expense of million 
the asset retirement obligations liability totaled million at december  had nisource adopted sfas no 
at the dates the actual liabilities were incurred  the asset retirement obligations liability would have been million and million at december  and  respectively  of which million and million were related to assets sold in additionally  refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards 
environmental matters nisource affiliates have retained environmental liability  including cleanup liability  associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations  petroleum operations  certain local gas distribution companies and columbia energy resources 
most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant mgp sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercury containing measuring equipment 
the ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required  other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability  and indemnification from previous facility owners 
only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and consistent with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
as costs become probable and reasonably estimable  reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate 
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations  for which it is ultimately liable  will not have a material adverse effect on nisource s financial position 
proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  a by product of burning fossil fuels  and methane  a component of natural gas 
certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 
nisource will monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions

gas distribution operations competition gas distribution operations competes with investor owned  municipal  and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area  and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers 
gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas 
competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky  southern ohio  central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost  coal fired generation 
in ohio and pennsylvania  gas on gas competition is also common 
gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which  over time  has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market 
restructuring during  nisource carried out a new reorganization initiative  which resulted in the elimination of approximately positions throughout all nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees 
gas distribution operations accrued approximately million of salaries  benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative 
the charge included million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in richmond  virginia and mount lebanon  pennsylvania 
payments made in in respect of the restructuring items within gas distribution operations were million 
additionally  during  the restructuring reserve was decreased by million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs 
the restructuring liability at december  and was million and million  respectively 
regulatory matters changes in gas industry regulation  which began in the mid s at the federal level  have broadened to retail customers at the state level 
for many years  large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use gas distribution operations facilities for transportation services 
beginning in the mid s  gas distribution operations has provided these choice r programs for their retail customers 
through december  approximately million of gas distribution operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an alternate supplier 
gas distribution operations continues to offer customer choice sm opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions 
while customer choice sm programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants  gas distribution operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future 
as customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers  the gas distribution operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for  but no longer need 
the state commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution operations are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations 
gas distribution operations is currently recovering  or has the opportunity to recover  the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered 
methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms  reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers 
through october  columbia of ohio is operating under a regulatory stipulation approved by the public utilities commission of ohio puco 
on october   columbia of ohio and other parties filed with the puco an amended stipulation that would govern columbia of ohio s regulatory framework from november through october the majority of columbia of ohio s contracts with interstate pipelines expire in october  and the amended stipulation would permit columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity sufficient to meet up to of the design peak day requirements through october  and up to of the design peak day requirements through october  among other things  the amended stipulation would also extend columbia of ohio s choice r program through october  provide columbia of ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover the stranded costs associated with the choice r program  and  allow columbia of ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed into service after october  and to defer the property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant 
on march   the puco issued an order that adopted and modified the stipulation from columbia gas of ohio and a collaborative of parties 
the order extended columbia of ohio s choice r program 
however  the order limited the time period of the stipulation through december  and declined to pre approve the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which columbia of ohio could contract 
in addition  the puco made other modifications which would limit columbia of ohio s ability to generate additional revenues sufficient to cover stranded costs  including declining to mandate that natural gas marketers participating in the choice r program obtain of their interstate capacity directly from columbia of ohio and changing the allocation of revenues generated through off systems sales 
the order allows columbia of ohio to record post in service carrying charges on plant placed in service after october and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation associated with such plant 
although this order will have a minimal impact on  nisource s initial estimate is that this order  if left unchanged  could potentially reduce operating income by approximately million annually through columbia gas of ohio anticipates  consistent with standard regulatory process  petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components which have been modified 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations as part of the annual review of columbia of ohio s gas cost recovery rates  the puco retained exeter associates  inc exeter to conduct a management performance review of columbia of ohio s gas purchasing practices and strategies 
on july   exeter filed its final audit report 
in the audit report exeter questioned columbia of ohio s decision to recontract for all of its pipeline capacity  and recommended that columbia of ohio should contract for only that post october capacity necessary to serve its bundled service customers  to meet the balancing requirements of choice r customers  and to accommodate the capacity assignment elections of choice r suppliers 
according to exeter  this approach would eliminate the need for columbia of ohio to engage in off system sales activities to recover stranded costs 
exeter also criticized columbia of ohio s procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders  which procedures had been the subject of a stipulation previously approved by the puco 
exeter therefore recommended that columbia of ohio s procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and operational matching orders be revised 
exeter further criticized columbia of ohio s volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges  and recommended that columbia of ohio redesign its balancing rates 
the issues raised in the exeter report will be resolved by the puco either in a rehearing on the stipulation or in the gas cost recovery case 
on december   the puco approved an application by columbia of ohio and other ohio ldcs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a five year period of previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable 
the approval of the tracker will allow for the recovery of million in previously uncollected accounts receivable for columbia of ohio 
on august   the iurc approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for northern indiana 
under the approved procedure  the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined  after hearings and iurc approval  and made effective on november of each year 
the demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the iurc 
the commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings  which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month  subject to refund 
the monthly filings do not require iurc approval but will be reviewed by the iurc during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing 
northern indiana s gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price 
northern indiana made its annual filing for on august  the iurc approved implementation of interim rates  subject to refund  effective november  testimony was filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered 
on september   the iurc issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in march and reducing recovery by million 
on october   the iurc approved the demand component of the adjustment factor 
northern indiana made its annual filing for on august  the iurc approved implementation of interim rates subject to refund  effective november  nisource expects the proceeding with respect to the program to be concluded during the second quarter of in addition  the gas cost incentive mechanism program  which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers expires at the end of  under the current settlement approved by the iurc 
nisource expects the program to continue after effective november  the pennsylvania public utility commission approved a surcharge allowing cpa 
to recover certain expenses related to columbia s customer assistance program for low income customers 
the customer assistance program is available to customers with incomes at or below of the poverty level 
the estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is million annually 
however  the surcharge will fluctuate based on the number of customers and cost of gas 
approximately million is reflected in the year ended december  the pennsylvania public utility commission approved the customer assistance surcharge on october   subject to customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge

gas distribution operations market conditions an economic slowdown during  which has extended through  contributed to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching to coal  heating oil and distillate resulted in industrial throughput falling from its peak of over billion cubic feet bcf 
the steel industry  which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of ohio  pennsylvania and kentucky  was particularly hard hit with a number of steel related companies filing for bankruptcy 
spot prices for the winter of were in the per dekatherm dth range with a large spike toward in february  significantly higher than the prices experienced during the winter season 
entering the winter season  storage levels were near the top of the five year range  however  concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures sustained higher prices 
mid way through the winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing five year average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever recorded by the energy information administration eia since the eia began recording such data in throughout the summer of  prices stayed between and dth 
thus far during the winter of price levels are between and dth  though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the five year average 
all nisource gas distribution operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs 
gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period 
the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings 
during times of unusually high gas prices  throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost 
the gas distribution operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace 
these efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory  the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets 
the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity 
the on system services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system 
the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges 
the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under regulatory matters 
capital expenditures the gas distribution operations segment s net capital expenditure program was million in and is projected to be approximately million in new business initiatives totaled approximately million in and are expected to be million in the remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities 
weather in general  nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days 
normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region 
while the temperature base for measuring heating degree days ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region  the nisource composite measurement is based on degrees 
in  nisource changed its definition of normal heating degree days using weather information from the average of years ended this resulted in a decrease in normal heating degree days of about

however  weather conditions were colder than for the year ended december   which resulted in increased net revenue of approximately million over throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december  were million dekatherms mdth  compared to mdth for this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales as a result of fewer market opportunities 
total volumes sold and transported of mdth for decreased mdth from this decrease was primarily due to the decline in off system sales

net revenues for were  million  down million from mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to million  mostly offset by a million increase in gas distribution revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to operating income for the twelve months ended december   operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above  the approval of a bad debt tracker for columbia of ohio for the recovery million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of million 
these benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of million  higher pension and postretirement expenses of million  and million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the period 
for the twelve months ended december   operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase consisted of million from increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and million from lower operating expenses 
these lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of million  million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses  decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of million and reductions of million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses

on september   the ferc issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original millennium project and specified that millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met 
one such condition  impacting phase of the project  is compliance with the coastal zone management act  which is administered by the state of new york s department of state nydos 
nydos has determined that the hudson river crossing plan is not consistent with the act 
millennium s appeal of that decision to the united states department of commerce was denied 
millennium filed an appeal of the us department of commerce ruling relating to the project s hudson river crossing plan in the us district court for the district of columbia on february  millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent  location  and timing of their needs and anticipates filing  later in  to amend its ferc certificate to accommodate the above described phasing of the project 
the sponsors of the proposed millennium project are columbia transmission  westcoast energy  inc subsidiary of duke energy corp  transcanada pipe lines ltd 
and mcn energy group  inc subsidiary of dte energy co regulatory matters on february   columbia transmission filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc certain scheduled annual rate adjustments  designated as the transportation costs rate adjustment tcra  retainage adjustment mechanism ram  and electric power cost adjustment epca 
these filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs incurred by columbia transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors tcra and epca  respectively  as well as quantities of gas required by columbia transmission to operate its pipeline system ram 
the recovery of each of these costs is done through a tracker which ensures recovery of only actual expenses 
on october   ferc issued an order accepting columbia transmission s compliance filing supporting its tcra filing  and accepting the full recovery of upstream transportation costs as proposed in the filing 
on february   ferc approved an order regarding the annual epca filing  which upheld columbia transmission s ability to fully recover its electric costs  but required columbia transmission to implement a separate epca rate to recover electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electric powered compressor station from specific customers 
the order also limits columbia transmission s ability to prospectively discount its epca rates 
management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact 
the ferc has not yet issued a final order in columbia transmission s ram proceeding

gas transmission and storage operations continued net revenues net revenues were million for  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to million of lower interruptible service revenues and million of lower firm service revenues 
the decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services 
firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipeline s eastern storage fields 
the limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory  a work stoppage that extended the outages and above normal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather 
in addition  storage and transportation revenues decreased million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities 
net revenues were million for  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to an million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the period compared to the period 
operating income operating income of million in increased million from the million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a million reduction in employee related and administrative expense  an improvement to income of million based on a decrease in estimated environmental expenditures  and a million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of the period was also favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of million  a million reduction in reserves related to unaccounted for gas  offset by million of increased expenses related to nisource s reorganization initiatives and other employee related costs and million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a long term note receivable
