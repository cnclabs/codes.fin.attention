item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap critical accounting policies revenue recognition matrix records profits on long term contracts on a percentage of completion basis on the cost to cost method 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
matrix includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contracts costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations would ever materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period when estimable or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that a contractor seeks to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
matrix records claims in accordance with paragraph of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this statement of position states that recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
those two requirements are satisfied by management s determination of the existence of all of the following conditions the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if such requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded to the extent that contract costs relating to the claim have been incurred 
the amounts recorded  if material  are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
costs attributable to claims are treated as costs of contract performance as incurred 

table of contents as of may  and  accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues  to the extent of costs incurred  for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
insurance reserves matrix maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for probable losses over and above our insurance coverage through reserves 
adjustments to reserves are recorded as new information regarding claims or potential claims become available 
goodwill under the provisions of the statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are tested annually for impairment 
the goodwill impairment analysis under sfas no 
requires us to allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of performing the impairment test 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are one level below or at the company s segment level 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed 
if the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment of the goodwill will be recorded 
the fair value of reporting units is primarily based on estimated future cash flows associated with the reporting unit 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each year 
upon completion of our fiscal year analysis  no impairment charge was necessary

consolidated selling  general  and administrative costs as a percent of revenue decreased to compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year the reduction in was due to leveraging the fixed cost structure with the hake acquisition  which spread these costs over a larger revenue base 
in addition  there were one time charges of approximately million in related to the integration of hake 
restructuring  impairment and abandonment for fiscal year consisted mainly of a one time insurance settlement of million from a recovery under matrix s environmental insurance policy of expenditures made to remediate previously owned properties in newnan  georgia  as well as a million reduction in workers compensation reserves related to exited operations 
interest expense increased to million in from million in as a result of increased debt that occurred as a result of the acquisition of hake  increased working capital needs  and collection delays resulting from a bankrupt customer and customers disputing amounts owed on three other projects 
the effective tax rates for the years ended may    and were   and  respectively

revenues for construction services in were million  an increase of million or  over the million reported for this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the hake group of companies for only the th quarter in fiscal as compared to the full year in fiscal the increase in revenues related to the hake group was partially offset by lower new tank construction activity 
gross margins declined to from in fiscal year  as a result of lower margin hake work in the mix of business particularly on large power projects  lower margins on new tank construction and a decline in matrix s west coast construction activity 
cost overruns  overruns by subcontractors to matrix  contract disputes and a bankrupt customer contributed to the lower margins realized on the hake work

new tank construction declined year over year 
gross margins widened to from in fiscal year  owing to higher margin projects and increased volume in our west coast construction group and the absence of two major power projects  which lost money in fiscal the increased revenues and improved gross margins resulted in gross profit for of million  a increase over the million reported for

gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of lower margin hake repair and maintenance work and lower margins on routine repair and maintenance activities as a result of lower demand in the first half of fiscal the lower margins on the hake repair and maintenance activity resulted from the strategic decision to take a large turnaround project in the second quarter with a new customer at very low gross margins

exited operations the sale of the assets of our brown subsidiary to caldwell tank  inc caldwell was executed in fiscal with matrix retaining temporary ownership of the land and buildings until environmental remediation was completed 
as part of the agreement  caldwell entered into a three year right to lease and an option to acquire the real estate and buildings for million and was obligated to acquire at the same specified price if matrix was able to satisfy specified environmental clean up measures within the three year period

financial condition liquidity matrix s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at may  and operations of matrix used million of cash for the twelve months ended may  as compared with providing million of cash for the twelve months ended may   representing a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease was primarily due to increased working capital needs and collection delays resulting from customers disputing amounts owed on three separate projects 
historically  matrix has financed its operations with cash from operations and from advances under a credit agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of the hake group on march   the company replaced its existing credit agreement with a new million senior credit facility entered into with a group of banks 
the original credit agreement consisted of a five year term loan up to million and a three year million revolving credit facility 
the company pays libor based interest on funds borrowed under the term loan and funds borrowed on a revolving basis bear interest on a prime or libor based option 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  limits the amount of additional borrowings and prohibits the payment of dividends 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the properties and assets of matrix and its domestic subsidiaries 
availability on the revolver was limited to the borrowing base  which was based on the level of the company s eligible receivables but could not exceed million 
in fiscal  the company s credit agreement was amended to allow revolver borrowings of million without any borrowing base limitation 
at may   million was outstanding under the revolver and million was outstanding under the five year term loan

the amendment also contains new financial covenants that the company expects to be in compliance with throughout fiscal interest on the new term loan is calculated at a rate equal to the eurodollar base rate plus until november   when the interest rate increases to an fixed rate 
beginning february   the interest rate further increases by on the last day of each fiscal quarter during which such million term loan remains outstanding 
the company intends to refinance the new term loan during the second quarter of fiscal upon the full and complete payment of the new term loan  availability under the revolver will increase to its original amount  subject to a permanent reduction equal to one half of any alternative capital obtained by matrix to refinance the new term loan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk matrix s interest rate risk exposure primarily results from its debt portfolio  which is influenced by short term rates  including prime rate and libor based borrowings under its credit agreement

in connection with the financing discussed above  the term loan was paid off  the swap ceased to be a highly effective hedge and hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively 
as the variable rate term loan was replaced with a variable rate credit facility  the forecasted transactions of variable rate interest payments are still probable of occurring 
as a result  changes in fair value of the swap are recognized in earnings  while the fair value balance at march  of million  net of tax  included in other comprehensive loss  will be amortized to income over the remaining life of the swap to june in fiscal  approximately million of accumulated other comprehensive loss was amortized to interest expense  while approximately million was amortized for the period march  to may  in fiscal  the change in the fair value of the swap of a million gain was included in interest expense

foreign currency risk matrix has a subsidiary whose operations are located in canada  whose functional currency is the local currency 
historically  movements in the foreign currency exchange rate have not significantly impacted results 
however  this investment does have the potential to impact matrix s financial position  due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the us dollar 
management has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency risk 
a change in the respective functional currency against the us dollar would not have had a material impact on the financial results of the company for the year ended may
