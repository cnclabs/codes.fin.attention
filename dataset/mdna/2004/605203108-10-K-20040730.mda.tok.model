as of december    and  total properties include a property at caspian in sunnyvale with no building 
during  the company paid the berg group approximately million for their commitment to complete an approximate  to  square foot building on the property 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes forward looking statements  including but not limited to statements with respect to the future financial performance  operating results  plans and objectives of mission west properties  inc 
actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending upon a variety of factors  including those described in part i item business risk factors 
overview and background our original predecessor was formed in as palomar mortgage investors  a california business trust  which operated as a mortgage reit until when  under the name of mission investment trust  it terminated its status as a reit and began to develop and market its own properties 
in  mission west properties was incorporated as a successor to mission investment trust 
in  our predecessor  mission west properties  sold all its real estate assets and paid a special dividend of per share to stockholders  after which it retained only nominal assets 
subsequently  the berg group acquired control of the corporation as a vehicle to acquire r d properties  or interests in entities owning such properties in a transaction completed september  at that time the berg group and the other investors acquired an aggregate controlling ownership position 
in may  we  the berg group members  john kontrabecki  and certain other persons entered into an acquisition agreement providing  among other things  for our acquisition of interests as the sole general partner in the operating partnerships 
at the time  the operating partnerships held approximately million rentable square feet of r d property located in silicon valley 
the agreement also provided for the parties to enter into the pending projects acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement and the exchange rights agreement  following stockholder approval 
effective july   we consummated our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships through the purchase of the general partnership interests  and all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  op units  which represented ownership of approximately of the operating partnerships 
our general partnership interests represented the balance of the ownership of the operating partnerships 
at december   we owned a general partnership interest in the operating partnerships  taken as a whole  on a weighted average basis 
since the beginning of calendar year  we have been taxed as a qualified reit 
our reincorporation under the laws of the state of maryland through the merger of mission west properties into mission west properties  inc occurred on december   at which time all outstanding shares issued by our predecessor california corporation were converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs  were used primarily to repay indebtedness 
we have grown through property acquisitions 
since september  we have acquired a total of approximately million rentable square feet of r d buildings under the pending project acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement  and from unrelated third parties 
the total cost of these properties was approximately million 
we issued a total of  op units and assumed debt totaling approximately million to acquire them 
on march   we acquired the orchard trimble property consisting of three r d properties with a total of approximately  rentable square feet for million in cash 
the acquisition of those properties was part of a tax deferred exchange under section of the internal revenue code 
on april   we acquired the acre san tomas technology park consisting of seven r d properties with a total of approximately  rentable square feet for million 
we financed that acquisition through new debt and an existing line of credit 
on december   we acquired a  square foot fully leased two story office r d building at optical court in san jose from the berg group under the berg land holdings option agreement 
the total acquisition price for this property was million 
we financed this acquisition by borrowing million under an existing line of credit and issuing  op units to various members of the berg group 
impact of restatements we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  as well as for the quarters ended march  june and september  and and the quarter ended december  as set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the following items we recorded additional amortization expense relating to certain leasing commissions  which were originally being amortized over a year period 
the additional amortization expense resulted from changing the amortization period of commissions from years to the term of the lease and the write off of certain unamortized leasing commissions in connection with tenant bankruptcies 
we corrected the purchase accounting originally applied to our acquisition of the orchard trimble property 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which became effective july   we allocated a portion of the purchase price to in place lease intangible assets and recorded additional amortization expense from changing the amortization period of these intangible assets from years to the term of the lease 
we recorded additional depreciation expense relating to the reclassification of certain real estate assets from a year depreciable life to a and year depreciable life 
we reclassified the amortization of the above market lease intangible asset relating to the acquisition of san thomas technology park from amortization expense to an offset to rental revenues from real estate 
the aggregate net impact of all restatement items on the consolidated statements of operations resulted in a decrease in net income to common stockholders compared to previously reported amounts of  per diluted share and  per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the aggregate net impact of all restatement items on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was a decrease in total assets of  a decrease in minority interest of  and an increase in the accumulated deficit of the effects of the restatement items described above on our net income to common shareholders are as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net income to common stockholders as previously reported   impact of adjustments for leasing commission amortization  intangible asset amortization depreciation of real estate assets total adjustments  minority interest portion of adjustments  net income to common stockholders  as restated   item selected financial data and notes and to our consolidated financial statements further discuss these restatements and their specific impact on our historical consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and related footnotes 
accounting and disclosure decisions with respect to material transactions that are subject to significant management judgments or estimates include impairment of long lived assets  deferred rent reserves  and allocation of purchase price relating to property acquisitions and the related depreciable lives assigned 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  giving due consideration to materiality  in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements  and potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
we believe that the following best describe our critical accounting policies real estate assets 
real estate assets are stated at cost 
cost includes expenditures for improvements or replacements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
gains and losses from sales are included in income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
business combinations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  was effective july  the acquisition costs of each property acquired prior to july  were allocated only to building  land and leasing commissions with building depreciation being computed based on an estimated weighted average composite useful life of years and leasing commissions amortization being computed over the term of the lease 
acquisitions of properties made subsequent to the effective date of sfas no 
are based on an allocation of the acquisition cost to land  building  tenant improvements  and intangibles for at market and above market in place leases  and the determination of their useful lives are guided by a combination sfas no 
and management s estimates 
if we do not appropriately allocate these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components  our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods  which will affect net income 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net cash flow  before interest  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
if impairment is recognized  the reduced carrying amount of the asset will be accounted for as its new cost 
for a depreciable asset  the new cost will be depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
generally  fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow  replacement cost or market comparison analyses 
the process of evaluating for impairment requires estimates as to future events and conditions  which are subject to varying market factors  such as the vacancy rates  future rental rates and operating costs for r d facilities in the silicon valley area and related submarkets 
therefore  it is reasonably possible that a change in estimate resulting from judgments as to future events could occur which would affect the recorded amounts of the property 
to date we have not recognized an impairment of any long lived assets 
discontinued operations sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting for discontinued operations and the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that the results of operations and gains or losses on the sale of property sold subsequent to december  that were not classified as held for sale at december  as well as the results of operations from properties that were classified as held for sale subsequent to december  be presented in discontinued operations if both the following criteria are met a the operation and cash flows of the property have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company as a result of the disposal transaction  and b the company will not have any significant involvement in the operations of the property after the disposal transaction 
sfas also requires prior period results of operations for these properties to be restated and presented in discontinued operations in prior consolidated statements of operations 
the application of sfas no 
to properties sold during resulted in discontinued operations presentation  with the results of operations being restated for this disposition 
properties sold during have been reflected as a gain on sale of assets within continuing operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred rent reserve 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
as such  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable based on the evaluation of our tenants financial position  analyses of accounts receivable and current economic trends 
we also make estimates for a straight line adjustment reserve for existing tenants with the potential of early termination  bankruptcy or ceasing operations 
our estimates are based on our review of tenants payment histories  publicly available financial information and such additional information about their financial condition as tenants provide to us 
the information available to us might lead us to overstate or understate these reserve amounts 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
moreover  actual future collections of accounts receivable or reductions in future reported rental income due to tenant bankruptcies or other business failures could differ materially from our estimates 
consolidated joint ventures 
we  through an operating partnership  own three properties that are in joint ventures of which we have interests 
we manage and operate all three properties 
the recognition of these properties and their operating results are reflected on our consolidated financial statements  with appropriate allocation to minority interest  because we have operational and financial control of the investments 
we make judgments and assumptions about the estimated monthly payments made to our minority interest joint venture partners  which are reported with our periodic results of operations 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we  through an operating partnership  have a non controlling limited partnership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture 
this investment is not consolidated because the we do not exercise significant control over major operating and financial decisions 
we account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and debt 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
these estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are carried at amounts that approximate their fair values due to their short term maturities 
the carrying amounts of our variable rate debt approximate fair value since the interest rates on these instruments are equivalent to rates currently offered to us 
for fixed rate debt  we estimate fair value by using discounted cash flow analyses based on borrowing rates for similar kinds of borrowing arrangements 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  was approximately million 
revenue recognition 
rental revenue is recognized on the straight line method of accounting required by gaap under which contractual rent payment increases are recognized evenly over the lease term  regardless of when the rent payments are received by us 
the difference between recognized rental income and rental cash receipts is recorded as deferred rent on the consolidated balance sheet 
certain lease agreements contain terms that provide for additional rents based on reimbursement of certain costs 
these additional rents are reflected on the accrual basis 
rental revenue is affected if existing tenants terminate or amend their leases 
we try to identify tenants who may be likely to declare bankruptcy or cease operations 
by anticipating these events in advance  we expect to take steps to minimize their impact on our reported results of operations through lease renegotiations  reserves against deferred rent  and other appropriate measures 
our judgments and estimations about tenants capacity to continue to meet their lease obligations will affect the rental revenue recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our rental revenue for any period if we made different judgments or estimations 
lease termination 
lease termination fees are included in other revenues 
these fees are paid by tenants who want to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual term of the lease 
there is no way of predicting or forecasting the timing or amounts of future lease termination fees 
we recognize income from rent  tenant reimbursements and lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  services have been rendered  the amount is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december rental revenues from continuing operations as of december   through our controlling interests in the operating partnerships  we owned r d properties totaling approximately million rentable square feet compared to such properties totaling approximately million rentable square feet as of december  this represented a net increase of approximately in total rentable square footage from the prior year

the million increase in rental revenues resulted from new property acquisitions  as same property rents decreased by  rents from newly developed properties acquired in represented an increase of million and rents from newly developed properties acquired in added approximately million of new rental revenue 
approximately million in rental revenues were generated from a property whose revenues and operating results were included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  the decline in rental revenues from the same property portfolio was a result from adverse market conditions and loss of several tenants due to bankruptcy  cessation of operations  or tenant relocation

equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint venture as of december   we had investments in four r d buildings  totaling  rentable square feet in morgan hill  california  through an unconsolidated joint venture with tbi  in which we acquired a interest from the berg group in january we have a non controlling limited partnership interest in this joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
for the year ended december   equity in earnings from the unconsolidated joint venture was approximately million  including million relating to a gain from the sale of real estate  which was acquired from a related party

reductions in property tax assessments as a result of appeals filed under proposition can be immediately increased to pre proposition assessed values when the county assessor determines market conditions have improved 
total operating expenses and real estate taxes exceeded tenant reimbursements because of vacancies  which reached approximately million rentable square feet by year end certain expenses such as property insurance  real estate taxes  and other fixed expenses are not recoverable from vacant properties 
we expect tenant reimbursements to decrease further in the coming year as our vacancy rate increases 
at june  our vacancy rate was 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the loss of one employee and the decrease of legal fees in the following table depicts the amounts of depreciation and amortization expense of real estate from continuing operations for the years ended december  and december  as restated change change dollars in thousands depreciation amortization    depreciation and amortization expense of real estate from continuing operations increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of eight r d properties in of the million increase in depreciation and amortization expense of real estate  approximately million represented amortization expense for in place leases comprising a portion of the value of the assets acquired in the acquisitions of the orchard trimble property and the san tomas technology park

interest expense related parties decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the refinancing of a portion of the related party debt with the new third party financing discussed above 
the new debt carries a higher interest rate than the berg group line of credit  which it mainly replaced  contributing to the increase in interest expense for the year 
we anticipate additional increases in interest expense as new debt is incurred in connection with property acquisitions and we draw on the cupertino national bank revolving line of credit

berg gave  op units to charitable institutions  which exchanged them for  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the exchange rights agreement in early january the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the conversion of op units to shares of the company s common stock were applied to increase our percentage interest as general partner in the operating partnerships 
year ended december  the most significant changes in our financial condition in resulted from property acquisitions and exchanges 
in addition  stockholders equity increased from the exercise of stock options and the exchange of op units for common stock 
during  we purchased eight r d properties  all located in silicon valley 
those acquisitions added approximately  square feet of rentable space and were acquired from the berg group under the berg land holdings option agreement 
the total gross acquisition price for these eight properties was approximately million 
we financed those acquisitions by borrowing million under our line of credit from the berg group  assuming other liabilities of million  and issuing  op units to various members of the berg group 
in addition to those eight property purchases we also acquired two r d properties representing approximately  rentable square feet from the berg group for approximately million in connection with a tax deferred section exchange for properties sold to cisco systems  inc in until we obtained those two replacement properties  the proceeds from the sale of properties to cisco systems  inc were classified as restricted cash for use in tax deferred property exchanges and on our balance sheet at december  no debt or op units were issued to acquire those two properties 
in january  we completed the sale  in a tax deferred exchange  of a  square foot r d property located at hellyer avenue  san jose  california to cisco systems  inc  which had exercised an option to purchase that property in november we realized a gain of million  which is included in gain on sales of assets  on the total sale price of million 
in september  we also completed the sale  in a tax deferred exchange  of a  square foot r d property located at fontanoso way  san jose  california to cisco systems  inc  which had also exercised an option to purchase that property in november we realized a gain of million  which is included in gain on sales of assets  on the total sale price of million 
during the year ended december   stock options were exercised to purchase a total of  shares of common stock  consisting of  shares exercised at per share   shares exercised at per share  and  shares exercised at per share 
total proceeds to the company were approximately million 
two limited partners exchanged  op units for  shares of the company s common stock under the terms of the exchange rights agreement 
the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the conversions of op units to shares of the company s common stock were applied to increase our percentage interest as general partner in the operating partnerships 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our principal source of liquidity for distributions to stockholders and op unit holders  debt service  leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures to come from cash provided by operations and or the borrowings under the lines of credit with the berg group and cupertino national bank 
we expect these sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet projected distributions to stockholders and other presently anticipated liquidity requirements in we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by us 
we have the ability to meet short term obligations or other liquidity needs based on lines of credit with the berg group and cupertino national bank  assuming renewal of our existing million line of credit which expires in september despite the current weakness in the economy  we expect our total interest expense to increase as interest rates rise and as we incur debt through acquisitions of new properties and financing activities 
in  we will be obligated to make payments totaling approximately million of debt principal under mortgage notes without regard to any debt refinancing or new debt obligations that we might incur  or optional payments of debt principal 
we anticipate renewing these obligations  primarily cupertino national bank and citicorp usa  as described below 
if we are not able to extend our loans from cupertino national bank and citicorp  however  we will be required to finance these loan payments through other sources that may not be readily avaliable to us on favorable terms 
our operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely  as a result 
effective january   the company and the berg group mutually agreed to reduce the berg group million line of credit to million and to reduce the number of properties securing the line of credit to five 
the berg group line of credit bears interest at libor plus  which was as of december   and matures in march debt of million under this line of credit was outstanding at december  we believe that the terms of the berg group line of credit were more favorable than those available from institutional lenders 
we are continually evaluating alternative sources of credit to replace the berg group line of credit 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a line of credit with terms similar to the berg group line of credit  and its cost of borrowing could increase substantially 
see item business risk factors our contractual business relationships with the berg group presents additional conflicts of interest which may result in the realization of economic benefits or the deferral of tax liabilities by the berg group without equivalent benefits to our stockholders 
on january   we obtained a million secured mortgage loan from northwestern mutual life insurance company northwestern loan that bears a fixed interest rate at and matures in january with principal payments amortized over years 
the mortgage loan is collateralized by properties 
we paid approximately  in loan fees and financing costs and used the proceeds to primarily pay down short term debt and the berg group line of credit 
on april   we obtained an million short term mortgage loan from citicorp usa  inc citicorp loan that bears interest at libor plus and originally matured on march  we and citicorp extended the loan to may  and again to september  the mortgage loan is collateralized by seven properties 
the extension of this loan is subject to our providing additional collateral valued at not less than million  which we have proposed to citicorp  and citicorp is currently appraising it 
we paid  in financing costs and used the proceeds to acquire the san tomas technology park property 
in july  the million line of credit with cupertino national bank was scheduled to mature 
cupertino national bank and citicorp usa  inc  have granted extensions of the loans to september  and september   respectively  the loan extension period pending the completion of our form k filing for we are in the process of renegotiating the terms and extending these loans for an additional two year period 
we do not believe that the terms of the extended loans will differ materially from their current terms

we were not in compliance with one covenant pertaining to our late filing of the form k for the year ending december  and form q for the period ending march  the financial reporting covenants 
each bank has elected not to enforce the financial reporting covenants during the loan extension period 
compliance with the financial reporting covenant is a condition of the renewal for both loans 
on january   we paid dividends of per share of common stock to all common stockholders of record as of december  on the same date  the operating partnerships paid a distribution of per op unit to all holders of op units

on december   the last trading day for the year  total market capitalization was approximately billion 
at december   the outstanding balance remaining under certain demand notes that we owed to the operating partnerships was million 
the due date of the demand notes has been extended to september  the principal of the demand notes  along with the interest expense  which is interest income to the operating partnerships  is eliminated in consolidation and is not included in the corresponding line items within the consolidated financial statements 
however  the interest income earned by the operating partnerships  which is interest expense to us  in connection with this debt  is included in the calculation of minority interest as reported on the consolidated statement of operations  thereby reducing our net income by this same amount 
at present  our only means for repayment of this debt is through distributions that we receive from the operating partnerships that are in excess of the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders 
historical cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted from adverse market conditions and loss of several tenants due to bankruptcy  cessation of operations  or tenant relocation resulting in increased vacancy rates that offset cash savings 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the prior year 
cash used in investing activities during related to financing the acquisition of the san tomas technology park of million as well as new equipment and improvements of million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  we paid debt principal and made distributions to holders of our common stock and op units utilizing cash generated from operating activities and other borrowed funds 
financing activities in also consisted of a million collateralized mortgage loan from northwestern mutual life insurance company  an million collateralized mortgage loan from citicorp usa  inc and a million line of credit established with cupertino national bank in july of which million had been drawn as of the year end

for the year ended december   we paid dividends to our stockholders and made distributions to the op unit holders totaling approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  capital expenditures the properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
for the years ended december  through december   the recurring tenant building improvement costs and leasing commissions incurred with respect to new leases and lease renewals of the properties previously owned or controlled by members of the berg group averaged approximately million annually 
we will have approximately  rentable square feet under expiring leases in we expect that the average annual cost of recurring tenant building improvements and leasing commissions  related to these properties  will be approximately million during we believe we will recover substantially all of these sums from the tenants under the new or renewed leases through increases in rental rates 
until we actually sign the leases  however  we cannot assure you that this will occur 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to be made to the properties 
tenant building improvements and leasing costs also may fluctuate in any given period year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease and the overall market conditions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by the company  but cannot be assured that we will be able to meet our requirements on favorable terms 
see policy with respect to certain activities financing policies 
funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measurement used by real estate investment trusts to measure and compare operating performance 
as defined by nareit  ffo represents net income loss before minority interest of op unit holders  computed in accordance with gaap  including non recurring events other than extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
with the emphasis on the disclosure of operating earnings per share  we will still continue to use ffo as a measure of the company s performance 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of profitability nor is it comparable to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of funds available to meet our cash needs  including our need to make cash distributions to satisfy reit requirements 
for example  ffo is not adjusted for payments of debt principal required under our debt service obligations 
our definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities  including minority interests that might be exchanged for common stock 
our ffo does not represent the amount available for management s discretionary use  as such funds may be needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
furthermore  ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define ffo exactly as we do 
we have revised our ffo computations for and for the inclusion of the amortization of leasing commissions in depreciation and amortization of real estate in order to be comparable to our ffo presentation in accordance with nareit guidelines and to more closely conform to the nareit s ffo definition 
additionally  our ffo calculation includes our portion of the depreciation and amortization of real estate from our unconsolidated tbi msw joint venture 
the revised ffo for the years ended december     and is as follows for the year ended december  as restated as restated dollars in thousands net income to common stockholders      add minority interests      depreciation and amortization of real estate      less gain loss on sales of joint venture assets    or assets ffo      the minority interest for third parties was deducted from total minority interest in calculating ffo 
also includes depreciation and amortization of real estate from our unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of leasing commissions 
net income to common stockholders is restated for and the effect of the revision in the ffo computation described above for the years ended december     and is as follows for the year ended december  as revised as restated as restated as reviewed as reviewed dollars in thousands ffo  as previously reported      less effect of restatements and reclassifications on the consolidated   statement of operations add additional depreciation and amortization from restatements   amortization of leasing commissions  depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint venture ffo  as revised      the reconciliation of consolidated net income as previously reported and as restated is described above 
see impact of restatements 
overview of distribution policy we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to stockholders and op unit holders based on our funds available for distributions 
our ability to make such distributions will be affected by numerous factors including  most importantly  the receipt of distributions from the operating partnerships 
funds available for distributions does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the actual return that we will realize and the amount available for distributions to stockholders will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenues received from our properties  our operating expenses  debt service on borrowings  and planned and unanticipated capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash available for distribution will exceed earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes  as the latter figure takes into account non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  that we will incur 
distributions  other than capital gain distributions  by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes most likely will be taxable to us stockholders as ordinary dividend income unless a stockholder is a tax exempt entity 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable reduction of the us stockholder s basis in the common stock to the extent of such basis  and thereafter as taxable gain 
the percentage of such distributions in excess of earnings and profits  if any  may vary from period to period 
distributions are determined by our board of directors and depend on actual cash available for distributions  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of the risk that we will not meet our distribution objectives  see part i  item  business risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
policies with respect to certain activities we have adopted policies with respect to investment  financing  conflicts of interest and other activities 
these policies have been formulated by our board of directors  are set forth in our charter  bylaws  operating partnership agreements or agreements with the berg group  and generally may be amended or revised from time to time  subject to applicable agreement terms  at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the stockholders 
among other things  these policies provide that so long as the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee as a director  and of the holders of a majority of the op units is required for us to take title to assets  other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the operating partnerships  or to conduct business other than through the operating partnerships  or for us or the operating partnerships to engage in any business other than the ownership  construction  development and operation of real estate properties  or for certain fundamental corporate actions  including amendments to our charter  bylaws or any operating partnership agreement and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the operating partnerships  changes in certain policies with respect to conflicts of interest must be consistent with legal requirements  certain policies with respect to competition by and acquisitions from the berg group are imposed pursuant to provisions of the acquisition agreement that cannot be amended or waived without the approval of the independent directors committee of our board of directors  we cannot take any action intended to terminate our qualification as a reit without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors  and we cannot undertake certain other specified transactions  including the issuance of debt securities  and borrowings in excess of specified limits  or the amendment of our charter and bylaws  without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors 
investment policies we expect to pursue our business and investment objectives principally through the direct ownership by the operating partnerships of our properties and future acquired properties 
development or investment activities are not limited to any specified percentage of our assets 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interests 
while we will emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion and subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification  invest in mortgage and other real estate interests  including securities of other real estate investment trusts 
we have not previously invested in mortgages or securities of other real estate investment trusts  and we do not have any present intention to make such investments 
financing policies to the extent that our board of directors determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financing or retention of cash flow  or through a combination of these sources  after consideration of provisions of the code requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of its taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income 
it is our present intention that any additional borrowings will be made through the operating partnerships  although we may incur borrowings that would be re loaned to the operating partnerships 
borrowings may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property  and may have full or limited recourse to all or any portion of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property 
we have adopted a policy of maintaining a consolidated ratio of debt to total market capitalization  which includes for this purpose the market value of all shares of common stock for which outstanding op units are exchangeable  of less than 
this ratio may not be exceeded without the approval of more than of our entire board of directors 
we also may determine to finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of additional op units in the operating partnerships  shares of common stock or other securities 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock or other capital stock  including securities senior to the common stock  in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that we issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for  shares of common stock  subject to limited exceptions  such as the issuance of common stock pursuant to any stock incentive plan adopted by us or pursuant to limited partners exercise of the exchange rights or the put rights  the limited partners will have the right to purchase common stock or such securities in order to maintain their respective percentage interests in us on a fully diluted basis 
if the board of directors determines that we will raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnerships  we will contribute such funds to the operating partnerships as a contribution to capital and purchase of additional general partnership interest  however  holders of op units will have the right to participate in such funding on a pro rata basis 
in the event that holders of op units sell their op units to us upon exercise of their put rights  we are authorized to raise the funds for such purchase by issuing additional shares of common stock 
alternatively  we may issue additional shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered op units 
our board of directors also has the authority to cause the operating partnerships to issue additional op units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration  as it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that the operating partnerships issue new op units for cash  but not property  the limited partners holding op units in an operating partnership will have the right to purchase op units in order  and to the extent necessary  to maintain their respective percentage interests in that operating partnership 
the new op units will be exchangeable for common stock pursuant to the exchange rights or may be tendered to us pursuant to the put rights 
disposition policies we have no current intention of disposing of any of our properties  although we reserve the right to do so 
the tax basis of the limited partners in the properties in the operating partnerships is substantially less than current fair market value 
accordingly  prior to the disposition of their op units  upon a disposition of any of the properties  a disproportionately large share of the gain for federal income tax purposes would be allocated to the limited partners 
consequently  it may be in the interests of the limited partners that we continue to hold the properties in order to defer such taxable gain 
in light of this tax effect  the operating partnership agreements provide that  until december   or until the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  less than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  if earlier  carl e 
berg and clyde j 
berg may prohibit the operating partnerships from disposing of properties which they designate in a taxable transaction 
mr 
kontrabecki has a similar right with respect to seven of the properties  which right will lapse before the end of the ten year period if his beneficial ownership interest falls below  op units 
the limited partners may seek to cause us to retain the properties even when such action may not be in the interests of some  or a majority  of our stockholders 
the operating partnerships will be able to effect tax deferred  like kind exchanges under section of the code  or in connection with other non taxable transactions  such as a contribution of property to a new partnership  without obtaining the prior written consent of these individuals 
the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee  will be required to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
the consent of the holders of a majority of the op units will be required to effect a sale or sales of all  or substantially all  of the assets of any of the operating partnerships 
impact of recently issued accounting standards we do not believe that recently issued accounting standards will materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
we have not entered into any new guarantees or modified any existing guarantees subsequent to december   therefore  adoption of this statement has had no effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  a revision to fin  which was issued in january under fin r  a variable interest entity must be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the entity s expected losses or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns or both 
fin r requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first reporting period that ends after march  we will adopt the consolidation requirements of fin r in the first quarter of we expect no significant effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of the initial adoption of this standard in regard to existing variable interest entities  however  newly formed entities could meet these requirements and will be recorded as appropriate 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
on december   we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and continue to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective beginning in the third quarter of the fasb deferred the implementation of sfas no 
as applied to certain minority interests in finite life entities  however 
we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
in the third quarter of  and considering the aforementioned deferral  it did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not generally hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we use fixed and variable rate debt to finance our operations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our current and future debt obligations 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations of interest rates on our floating rate debt 
we manage our market risk by monitoring interest rates where we try to recognize the unpredictability of the financial markets and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on the results of our operations 
this takes frequent evaluation of available lending rates and examination of opportunities to reduce interest expense through new sources of debt financing 
several factors affecting the interest rate risk include governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economics and other factors that are beyond our control 
the following table provides information about the principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates  and expected maturity dates for debt outstanding as of december  the current terms of this debt are described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
average interest rates are based on implied libor for the respective time period 
fair value approximates book value for fixed rate debt 
of the projected fair value of secured notes payable  approximately million and million represent the prudential and northwestern secured loans  respectively 
for variable rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid upon maturity 
for fixed rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid according to scheduled principal payments and that we will not prepay any of the outstanding principal balance 
thereafter total fair value variable rate debt dollars in thousands secured and unsecured debt     weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt secured notes payable         weighted average interest rate the variable rate debt represented and and the fixed rate debt represented and of all debt outstanding for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of the debt is denominated in united states dollars 
the weighted average interest rate for variable rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in spread was due to numerous cuts in interest rates by the federal reserve board during and the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in interest expense attributable to the average interest rate difference between and was million  which was also a result of new debt obtained during we do not anticipate significant interest rate changes from to the primary market risk we face is the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the berg group line of credit  the cupertino national bank line of credit  and the citicorp usa  inc loan  which are tied to a libor based interest rate  were approximately million  or  of the total million of debt as of december  as a result  we pay lower rates of interest in periods of decreasing interest rates and higher rates of interest in periods of increasing interest rates 
at december   we had no interest rate caps or interest rate swap contracts 
the following discussion of market risk is based solely on a possible hypothetical change in future market conditions related to our variable rate debt 
it includes forward looking statements regarding market risk  but we are not forecasting the occurrence of these market changes 
based on the amount of variable debt outstanding as of december   a increase or decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease or increase  respectively  annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million  as a result of the increased or decreased interest expense associated with the change in rate  and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates and the specific actions that might be taken by us to mitigate of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes on our financial structure
