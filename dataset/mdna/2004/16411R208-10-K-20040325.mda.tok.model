item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are engaged primarily in the development of a liquefied natural gas  or lng  receiving terminal business and related lng business opportunities centered on the us gulf coast 
the lng receiving terminal business consists of receiving deliveries of lng from lng ships  processing such lng to return it to a gaseous state and delivering it to pipelines for transportation to purchasers 
we are also engaged in oil and gas exploration  development and exploitation activities in the gulf of mexico 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and overview our financial results for the year ended december  reflect a loss of  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a loss of  or per share basic and diluted in the major factors contributing to our loss in were lng receiving terminal development expenses of  which were offset by a  minority interest in the operations of our corpus christi lng partnership  our equity share of the loss in the freeport lng limited partnership of  and other general and administrative expenses of  these factors are offset by a  gain on the sale of lng assets and a  gain on the sale of a limited partnership interest in the freeport lng terminal 
lng terminal development activities our principal focus in both and was the development of lng receiving terminals 
as a result  terminal development expenses represented a major part of our operating costs and expenses for both years 
in  we phased out our direct involvement in developing the freeport  texas  site  but we accelerated the schedule of terminal development at two new sites located near sabine pass  louisiana  and near corpus christi  texas 
accordingly  gross terminal development expenses  before any cost recoveries  were higher in  than in 
in  we formed a limited partnership to develop the corpus christi lng terminal 
we are the general partner  and we own a limited partner interest 
we recorded  in terminal development expenses related to this site in  however  this amount was completely offset by the minority interest of our partner who provided funding for all development costs in the remainder of our terminal development expenses related to the sabine pass site  where we own of the project 
in  we incurred  in terminal development expenses for the freeport lng terminal 
we entered into an agreement in august to sell a interest in the terminal in exchange for payments to us totaling  over time and payments to others of up to  for expenses  which were already incurred or are to be incurred in connection with the development of the freeport lng terminal 
during   in such development expenses were charged to the purchaser 
this recovery reduced our terminal development expenses reported for to  in february  our freeport lng terminal project was acquired by freeport lng in which we received a limited partnership interest in addition to the consideration described above 
in connection with the sale of lng assets to freeport lng  we reported a gain of  furthermore  we sold a interest in freeport lng in march for  resulting in a gain of  throughout  we received payments totaling  from freeport lng  which amounts were recorded as a reduction to our investment in the partnership 
in addition  our limited partner interest in the operations of freeport lng resulted in our 
table of contents recording equity in the net loss of the partnership of  for this non cash loss reduced our investment in freeport lng to zero 
other general and administrative expenses other general and administrative g a expenses relate to our general corporate and other activities 
these expenses increased  or  to  in compared to  in the principal components of g a are employee compensation and contracted services  legal fees and travel 
we expanded our staff from to throughout as we expanded our business 
we incurred more legal expenses in connection with securities compliance filings and increased securities registration costs 
we traveled more as we increased our profile among the investment community and as we developed an lng trading venture based in europe 
oil and gas activities oil and gas revenues increased by  or  to  in from  in as a result of increased production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in and increased average natural gas prices of per mcf in from per mcf in we had production from wells in as compared with six wells in we incurred no production costs in because all of our revenues were generated from non cost bearing overriding royalty interests 
production costs in totaled  and related to the early months of before we sold our cost bearing working interests in oil and gas properties 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate on january   we began accounting for our interest in gryphon on the cost method of accounting because we no longer had sufficient board representation to provide us with the opportunity to exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the company 
in  we accounted for our investment using the equity method of accounting  and our equity share of gryphon s losses was  results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and overview our financial results for the year ended december  reflect a loss of  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a loss of  or per share basic and diluted in the major factors contributing to our loss in were lng terminal development expenses of  offset by cost recoveries of  for a net cost of  other general and administrative expenses of  and equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate of  lng terminal development activities throughout and  our operations were primarily focused on the development of a potential lng terminal site near freeport  texas 
gross terminal development expenses  before any cost recoveries  incurred in  were higher than in 
the increased level of expenditures relates principally to the advancing stages of the project and the acceleration of work leading to the filing of an application with ferc in march in august  we entered into an agreement to sell a interest in the freeport lng terminal in exchange for payments to us totaling  and additional payments of up to  for expenses which were already incurred or to be incurred later in connection with the development of the freeport lng terminal 
during   in such development expenses were charged to the purchaser 
this recovery reduced our terminal development expenses reported for to  oil and gas activities oil and gas revenues decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreased production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in 
the decline in production volumes primarily results from the sale of our two producing wells at west cameron block in april adding to the effect of declining production was a decrease in average gas prices to per mcf in compared to per mcf in the prior year 
production costs decreased to  in from  in 
table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased to  in from  in as a result of both the decline in our production volumes  described above  and a lower dd a rate per unit per mcfe versus per mcfe 
our dd a rate declined due to our change in emphasis toward selling prospects for front end fees plus carried interests  as opposed to direct participation in drilling costs  and due to the effect of our  ceiling test write downs recorded in other general and administrative expenses g a related to our general corporate and other activities  decreased  or  to  in compared to  in the major components of the decrease were in legal fees  investor relations expenses and franchise taxes 
legal fees were lower in because in they included costs related to the buyout of our partner s interest in the seismic data set of the cameron project and a higher level of securities compliance filings and securities registration costs than in our investor relations efforts in were less extensive than in when we made a concerted effort to communicate with the investment community about our completed transaction with warburg to form our affiliate  gryphon  and our new listing on the american stock exchange 
franchise taxes were lower in because we had a reverse stock split  which reduced our authorized shares from  shares to  during equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate includes our share of the net loss of gryphon  but also gryphon s preferred dividends in arrears 
the amount we recognized for decreased to  from  in because during our recognition of these non cash charges reduced our investment basis to zero 
we did not reduce our basis below zero because we did not guarantee any obligations of gryphon and were not committed to provide additional financial support to gryphon 
liquidity and capital resources management expects that we will meet all of our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months through a combination of cash balances  collection of receivables  issuances of our debt or equity securities  issuances of common stock pursuant to exercises by the holders of existing warrants and options  sales of regas capacity in our planned lng receiving terminals  sales of prospects generated by our exploration group  borrowings under our line of credit and cash flows from current operations 
in the event that we are unable to obtain additional capital from one or more of these sources  our operations could be adversely affected 
at december   we had working capital of  in january  we received net proceeds of  from a private placement of  shares of our common stock  and we also received the remaining  from freeport lng  which was payable pursuant to the sale of our interest in the freeport lng project 
in january and february  we received net proceeds of  related to the issuance of  shares of common stock pursuant to exercises of warrants and stock options 
the pro forma effect of these transactions  had they been consummated as of december   would have been to increase our working capital to cash flow from operating activities net cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled  compared to net cash used in operations of  in because most of our resources were dedicated to the development of lng receiving terminals in both and  the main reason for the increase is that we were involved in the development of three lng receiving terminals during as compared with only one terminal throughout most of issuances of common stock since our inception  the primary source of financing for our operating expenses  investments in our exploration program and investments in our development of lng receiving terminals has been the sale of our

through december   we have issued  shares of cheniere common stock  generating net proceeds of  during and  we raised  and  respectively  net of offering costs  from the exchange or exercise of warrants  the exercise of stock options and the sale of cheniere units common stock and warrants to accredited investors pursuant to regulation d 
proceeds of the offerings were used for the development of lng receiving terminals and for general corporate purposes 
we issued a total of  shares of common stock in in april  we issued  shares of common stock pursuant to a contingent contractual obligation related to cheniere s acquisition of an option to lease the freeport lng terminal site 
in may  we issued  shares of common stock to seventeen investors in a private placement made pursuant to regulation d 
the purchase price of the shares included cash of  and the surrender of existing warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
offering expenses relating to the private placement were  in august  we issued  shares pursuant to a cashless exercise of warrants to purchase  shares 
throughout  we issued a total of  shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants  resulting in net cash proceeds of  we also issued  shares pursuant to the exercise of stock options  resulting in proceeds of we did not sell any equity securities in in  we issued a total of  shares of common stock 
in february  we issued to one stockholder  units at a cash purchase price of per unit  each unit consisting of one share of cheniere common stock  
par value per share  and one warrant to purchase one sixth of a share of cheniere common stock 
proceeds of the offering  net of offering costs  were  in june  we issued  shares of cheniere common stock as partial consideration for a lease option on an lng receiving terminal site near freeport  texas 
bank line of credit on july   we established a  line of credit with a commercial bank  with an initial borrowing base of  the facility is secured by our assets  and its term runs through december  borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus per annum 
in addition  a commitment fee of per annum is assessed on the unused borrowing base capacity 
a loan origination fee of of the initial borrowing base was paid at closing 
during  we borrowed  under the facility to acquire oil and gas leases 
the balance was repaid in january we also used the facility to establish a standby letter of credit in the amount of  in connection with our office lease 
short term promissory notes in february  we executed a promissory note payable in the amount of  the proceeds of the note were used to pay certain costs related to our d seismic database 
in july  we repaid the note payable 
in june  we received a  payment for the sale of options to purchase an aggregate of up to a interest in the freeport lng receiving terminal project 
the payment was refundable  and repayment was secured by a note payable that we executed 
in march  an option was exercised and the note payable was canceled 
sale of interest in freeport lng terminal in august  we entered into an agreement to sell a interest in our planned lng receiving facility near freeport  texas 
in february  our freeport lng project was acquired by freeport lng development  lp  in which we held a interest 
effective march   we sold a interest in freeport lng to an affiliate of contango oil gas company for  payable over time 
we now retain a interest in freeport lng 
freeport lng paid us cash and assumed liabilities related to the freeport lng project for costs  which represented an aggregate amount of  in addition to paying us a  initial installment at 
table of contents closing 
we received additional payments of  in and  in january from freeport lng 
in june  dow signed an agreement with freeport lng for the potential long term use of the receiving terminal 
under the agreement  dow will have regas rights to as much as mmcf d beginning with commercial start up of the facility in in february  freeport lng and dow entered into a year tua providing for a firm commitment by dow for the use of mmcf d of regas capacity and an option by dow until august to acquire an additional mmcf d of regas capacity 
on december   conocophillips and freeport lng signed an agreement under which conocophillips will reserve one bcf per day of regas capacity in the terminal at the freeport facility 
conocophillips will also obtain a interest in the general partner of freeport lng and provide a substantial majority of the financing to construct the facility  which is currently estimated to cost in excess of million 
the conocophillips transaction is expected to close in the spring of  subject to completion of remaining documentation and satisfaction of closing conditions 
because the initial development expenses of the freeport lng project are to be funded by the limited partner in freeport lng  we have not been required to contribute any cash to freeport lng for development activities  nor do we anticipate being required to make capital contributions to freeport lng in the future 
corpus christi lng terminal funding negotiations under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of corpus lng  which was formed for our corpus christi lng receiving terminal project  we contributed our technical expertise and know how  and all of the work in progress related to the corpus christi project  in exchange for a limited partner interest in corpus lng 
bpu lng committed to contribute its approximately acre tract of land plus related easements and additional rights to an additional acres  and cash to fund the first  of corpus lng project expenses in exchange for a limited partner interest 
we will manage the project through the general partner interest held by our wholly owned subsidiary 
exploration funding on october   we completed a transaction with warburg to fund our exploration program on approximately  square miles of seismic data in the gulf of mexico through a newly formed affiliated company  gryphon 
we contributed selected assets and liabilities in exchange for of the common stock of gryphon effective interest after conversion of preferred stock and  in cash 
warburg contributed  and received preferred stock  with an cumulative dividend  convertible into of gryphon s common stock 
cheniere and warburg also have the option  in connection with subsequent capital calls made by gryphon  to contribute up to an additional  to gryphon  proportionate to their respective ownership interests 
under the terms of the agreement governing these additional contributions  in the event that either we or warburg elects not to participate in any additional contribution  the other investor has the option to purchase the non participating investor s proportionate share 
during and  gryphon made cash calls totaling  against its capital commitment of  gryphon made no additional cash calls during we declined to participate in such cash calls  and warburg elected to purchase our proportionate share of such cash calls 
as a result  our ownership interest in gryphon  after the potential effect of converting preferred stock into common stock  was reduced from at december  to as of december  prior to  we accounted for our investment in gryphon using the equity method of accounting 
effective january   we began accounting for our investment in gryphon using the cost method of accounting because we lost the ability to exercise significant influence over gryphon s operating and financial policies  as our representation on gryphon s board of directors was reduced to one director 

table of contents seismic reprocessing between june and october  we acquired licenses to approximately  miles of seismic data primarily in the shallow waters offshore texas and also in the west cameron area in the gulf of mexico the offshore texas project area in separate transactions with seitel data ltd  a division of seitel inc  and jebco seismic  lp we committed to reprocess all of the data from the offshore texas project area at a cost of approximately  payable in installments beginning in october and continuing through the final delivery of reprocessed data  which was received in we have no existing or contingent liability related to seismic reprocessing as of december  sale of licenses to seismic data in june and july  we sold licenses to  square miles of seismic data to gryphon for  we received cash proceeds of  gryphon also assumed  of our obligation to fund the reprocessing of the seismic data 
in connection with the transactions  we also transferred  shares of gryphon common stock to gryphon 
we retain one license to all of the data in the offshore texas project area 
sale of proprietary seismic data in september  we acquired for  all rights to our square mile proprietary seismic database from the industry partner with whom we had jointly acquired the data in and we subsequently sold the seismic data to a seismic marketing company for  and a share in licensing proceeds generated by the marketing company 
in september  we sold our remaining interest in future licensing proceeds to the marketing company for  proceeds from the september and sales of d seismic data were recorded as a reduction to our unproved oil and gas property costs 
we retain a license to all of the seismic data for use in our exploration program 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on certain of our contracts 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due for years ended december  total thereafter note payable operating leases lng consulting retainer at december   we had borrowings of  against our  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the  was repaid in january a discussion of operating leases can be found at note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  we engaged research consultants in connection with the development of our lng receiving terminal business 
in connection with the february closing on the sale of the freeport lng terminal described above  we agreed to make cash payments totaling  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock at a price of per share to the consultants 
a payment of  was made in  and the remaining amount will be paid in our obligations under lng site options are renewable on an annual or semiannual basis 
we may terminate our obligation at any time by electing not to renew or by exercising the option 

table of contents other matters critical accounting estimates and policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them  and often consult with our independent accountants about the appropriate interpretation and application of these policies 
our most critical accounting policy is our accounting under the full cost method of accounting 
this area involves complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
accounting for lng activities we have been in the preliminary stage of developing lng receiving terminals 
substantially all costs related thereto have been expensed when incurred 
land costs associated with lng terminal sites are capitalized 
costs of certain permits are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
we have also incurred costs related to options to purchase or lease land that may be used for potential lng terminal sites 
full cost method of accounting we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and non productive exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  together with internal costs directly attributable to property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
interest is capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development 
the costs of our oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are depreciated using a composite units of production rate based on estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  then the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
net capitalized costs are limited to a capitalization ceiling  calculated on a quarterly basis as the aggregate of the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  less related income tax effects 
at june  and september   our capitalized costs exceeded our capitalization ceiling  resulting in ceiling test write downs totaling  for the year 
our allocation of seismic exploration costs to proved properties involves an estimate of the total reserves to be discovered in the project 
this estimate includes a number of assumptions that we have factored into a four year plan 
such factors include an estimate of the number of exploration prospects generated  prospect reserve potential  success ratios and ownership interests 
we transfer unproved properties to proved properties based on a ratio of proved reserves discovered at a point in time to the estimate of total reserves to be discovered in our exploration program 
it is reasonably possible  based on the results obtained from future drilling and prospect generation  that revisions to this estimate could affect our capitalization ceiling 

table of contents oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this document for is based on estimates prepared by sharp petroleum engineering  inc estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows does not necessarily represent the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimate of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and subsequently revised the interpretation in december fin r 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
as revised  fin r is now generally effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending on or after march  we have not identified any variable interest entities 
in the event a variable interest entity is identified  we do not expect the requirements of fin r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
an issuer is required to classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of this statement as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted the standard on july   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other recent developments in july  an issue was brought before the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding whether or not contract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contract mineral rights should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets 
the issue presents a view that these mineral rights are intangible assets 
table of contents as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and  therefore  should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective for transactions subsequent to june   with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
required as of january  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the statement  intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements 
sfas no 
does not apply to accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by sfas no 
 and is silent about whether or not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies 
the emerging issues task force eitf has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how we classify these assets 
should such a change be required  the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases that would be classified as intangible undeveloped mineral interest are immaterial as of december  and december  the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases that would be classified as intangible developed mineral interest are also immaterial as of december  and december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the development of our lng receiving terminal business is based upon the foundational premise that prices of natural gas in the us will be sustained at levels of per mcf or more 
should the price of natural gas in the us decline to sustained levels below per mcf  our ability to develop and operate lng receiving terminals could be significantly negatively affected 
we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and condensate 
as a result  our financial results can be affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we have not entered into any derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  our financial condition is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on our borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to our results of operations
