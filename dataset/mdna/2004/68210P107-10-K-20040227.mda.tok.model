geographic information the company operates within one industry segment  menhaden fishing  for the production and sale of fish meal  fish solubles and fish oil 
export sales of fish oil and fish meal were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
such sales were made primarily to european and asian markets 
in  and  sales to one customer were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this customer differed from year to year 
the following table shows the geographical distribution of revenues in thousands based on location of customers years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent us europe asia canada south central america mexico other total company overview omega is the nation s largest producer of protein rich fish meal and fish oil 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and includes regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
fishing 
during  the company owned a fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft for use in its fishing operations and also leased additional aircraft where necessary to facilitate operations 
during the fishing season in the gulf of mexico  which runs from mid april through october  the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft 
the fishing area in the gulf is generally located along the gulf coast  with a concentration off the louisiana and mississippi coasts 
the fishing season along the atlantic coast begins in early may and usually extends into december 
the company operated fishing vessels and spotter aircraft along the mid atlantic coast  concentrated primarily in and around virginia and north carolina 
the remaining fleet of fishing vessels and spotter aircraft are not routinely operated during the fishing season and are back up to the active fleet  used for other transportation purposes or may be in the process of refurbishment in the company s shipyard 
subsequent to the fishing season  the company embarked on a program of cost cutting measures which included  among other items  utilization of carry vessels and a reduction in the number of fishing vessels and spotter planes deployed 
since  the deployment of fishing vessels and spotter planes has been reduced by vessels and planes 
menhaden usually school in large  tight clusters and are commonly found in warm  shallow waters 
spotter aircraft locate the schools and direct the fishing vessels to them 
the principal fishing vessels transport two foot purse boats  each carrying several fishermen and one end of a  foot net 
the purse boats encircle the school and capture the fish in the net 
the fish are then pumped from the net into refrigerated holds of the fishing vessel or onto a carry vessel  and then are unloaded at the company s processing plants 
meal and oil processing plants 
during  the company operated four processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia  where the menhaden are processed into three general products types fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles 
as of december   the company s four active processing plants had an aggregate annual capacity to process approximately  tons of fish 
the company s processing plants are located in coastal areas near the company s fishing fleet 
annual volume processed varies depending upon menhaden catch and demand 
each plant maintains a dedicated dock to unload fish  fish processing equipment and storage capacity 
the fish are unloaded from the fishing vessels into storage boxes and then conveyed into steam cookers 
the fish are then passed through presses to remove most of the oil and water 
the solid portions of the fish are dried and ground into fish meal 
the liquid that is produced in the cooking and pressing operations contains oil  water  dissolved protein and some fish solids 
this liquid is decanted to remove the solids and is put through a centrifugal oil and water separation process 
the separated fish oil is a finished product called crude oil 
the separated water and protein mixture is further processed through evaporators to recover the soluble protein  which can be sold as a finished product or added to the solid portions of the fish for processing into fish meal 
food grade oil processing plant 
in april  the company commenced building a new metric ton per day fish oil processing facility at its reedville  virginia plant 
the project is expected to be completed by mid the food grade facility will include state of the art processing equipment and controls that will allow the company to refine  bleach  winterize and deodorize its menhaden fish oil and results in refined oil and will more than triple the company s existing refined fish oil production capacity 
the new facility will provide the company with automated packaging and refrigerated on site storage capacity 
the new complex also will have a new fully equipped lipids laboratory which will enhance the development of omega oils and food products 
overall  the company expects to invest approximately million in the new facility 
the company s existing oil processing facility in reedville will continue in operation until the new facility is operational 
products 
the company sells three general types of products fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles 
fish meal 
fish meal  the principal product made from menhaden  is sold primarily as a high protein feed ingredient 
it is used as a protein supplement in feed formulated for pigs and other livestock  aquaculture and household pets 
each use requires certain standards to be met regarding quality and protein content  which are determined by the freshness of the fish and by processing conditions such as speed and temperatures 
the company produces fish meal of several different types special select 
special select is a premium grade low temperature processed fish meal 
the quality control guidelines are very stringent  producing a higher protein level and higher digestibility and a lower total volatile nitrogen tvn and histamine count 
these guidelines require that only the freshest fish and the most gentle drying process be used 
special select is targeted for monogastrics  including baby pigs  turkey poults  mink  shrimp and trout 
sealac 
sealac is similar to special select in its freshness low tvn and gentle drying high digestibility 
during the processing however  the company removes most of the soluble protein 
this step allows the amount of rumen undegradable protein to be maximized while still maintaining excellent digestibility 
this product is made specifically for dairy and beef cattle  sheep  goats and other ruminants requiring bypass protein 
faq meal 
faq fair average quality meal  the company s commodity grade fish meal  guarantees a protein content of at least 
this product typically is used in protein blends for poultry  catfish  pets and other animals 
fish oil 
the company produces crude unrefined fish oil  refined fish oil and food grade oils 
unrefined fish oil 
unrefined fish oil also referred to as crude fish oil is the company s basic fish oil product 
this grade of fish oil has not undergone any portion of the refining process 
the company s markets for crude fish oil have changed over the past decade 
in the early s  the company s main crude fish oil market  which accounted for greater than of the company s production  was utilized by manufacturers of hydrogenated oils for human consumption such as margarine and shortening 
in  the company estimates that approximately of its crude fish oil was sold as a feed ingredient to the aquaculture industry 
the growth of the worldwide aquaculture industry has resulted in increasing demand for fish oils in order to improve feed efficiency  survivability and health of farm raised fish species 
refined fish oil 
the company s refined fish oils come in three basic grades and also includes crude fish oils of special quality or that may require custom packaging or special additives 
feed grade oils 
feed grade menhaden oil is processed and refined to offer a high omega oil for use in premium pet  aquaculture and livestock feeds  as well as agricultural and attractant applications 
the processing reduces oxidation while enhancing stable omega fatty acids for incorporation in the final feed to enhance skin and coat conditioning  reproductive performance  and increasing immunity 
both kosher and organic products are available 
seacide tm 
one new product that the company has developed from refined fish oil is seacide tm 
seacide tm is a unique blend of refined menhaden oil  cottonseed oil and an organic emulsifier developed for use against target pests and diseases that occur in a variety of field crops  orchards  vineyards and greenhouse operations 
seacide tm is an all natural organic alternative to chemical insecticides and fungicides  is less phytotoxic than petroleum based oils  is compatible with most fertilizers  and is versatile enough for use on virtually any crop 
food grade oils 
the company has developed a patented process to fully refine menhaden oil to remove flavor  odor  and pro oxidants and offer a naturally high long chain omega content 
the company s main product in this grade is omegapure tm 
food applications for omegapure tm are designed to deliver a stable  odorless  flavorless source of omega fatty acids to enhance human nutrition 
these applications include mainstream consumer foods  medical care foods and dietary supplements 
omegapure tm also is kosher certified and organic 
omega fatty acids exist in two forms long chain and short chain 
short chain omega s or alpha linolenic acid ala  are generally found in canola oil  soy beans and flaxseed  and generally require five to ten times as much concentration to approach the same benefit levels as long chain omega s 
long chain omega fatty acids are generally found in marine sources and consist of two main types eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenic acid dha 
epa is a fatty acid that generally reduces inflammatory responses and has been linked to the alleviation of symptoms from asthma  arthritis  psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions 
dha is a major structural fatty acid in the brain and the eye s retina 
dha is important for proper brain and eye development in infants and has been shown to support cardiovascular health in adults 
various scientific studies have linked consumption of omega fatty acids to a number of nutritional and health benefits  such as heart health  treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  improving brain and eye function and treatment of depression 
for example  in november  the american heart association aha issued a scientific statement entitled fish consumption  fish oil  omega fatty acids  and cardiovascular disease 
the scientific statement outlines the findings of a comprehensive report that examined the cardiovascular health benefit of omega fatty acids from fish sources  specifically dha and epa 
the report concluded that consumption of such omega fatty acids  either through diet or supplements  reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease 
the statement refers to studies that have indicated the following to be associated with the intake of omega fatty acids decreased risk of sudden death and arrhythmia  decreased thrombosis blood clot  decreased triglyceride levels  decreased growth of atherosclerotic plaque  improved arterial health and lower blood pressure 
the scientific statement concludes that omega fatty acids have been shown in epidemiological and clinical trials to reduce the incidence of heart disease 
menhaden oil currently is the only marine source of long chain omega s directly affirmed by the fda as a generally recognized as safe or gras food ingredient for direct human consumption 
the fda has approved menhaden oil use in different food categories such as margarine  salad dressings  condiments  yogurt  ice cream  cheese  prepared meats  sauces  soups  crackers  cookies  cereals and bakery products 
in february  the fda posted for public comment a proposed regulation that would add additional food categories to the list already approved for the inclusion of rich menhaden oil 
in january  the fda published a tentative final rule for public comment which would increase to the number of food categories approved for inclusion of menhaden oil  subject to the condition that menhaden oil is not used in combination with other oils that are a significant source of epa and dha 
several additional developments have occurred over the last year that the company believes could also benefit its sales efforts for omegapure tm 
in may  the white house office of management and budget requested that the us department of agriculture usda and the department of health and human services further incorporate the large body of recent public health evidence linking food consumption patterns to health and disease as the usda s dietary guidelines for americans is revised for its scheduled release and to update the usda s food guide pyramid  which was introduced in the letter stated that both epidemiologic and clinical studies find that an increase in consumption of omega fatty acids results in reduced deaths due to coronary heart disease chd 
the recent revision of the american heart association s aha s dietary guidelines recognizes this evidence by recommending consuming fish  which is high in omega fatty acids  at least twice weekly to reduce the risk of chd 
in addition  the aha recommends the inclusion of oils and other food sources high in omega fatty acids 
in july  a us senate committee report stated that learning disabilities and behavioral disorders have been linked to low serum levels of omega fatty acids 
therefore  particular attention should be paid to developing food choices that are high in omega fatty acids 
the company was successful in working with a large supplier of school meals to make available omegapure fortified foods in school districts in south texas starting in february the company hopes to expand the availability of these and additional omegapure fortified products into other school systems in other states 
industrial grade oils 
industrial grade menhaden oil is refined and processed to enhance the unique fatty acid range  making it desirable for a number of drying and lubricating applications including coolant transfer  chemical raw material  drying and rustproofing paints  drilling fluids and leather treatment chemicals 
fish solubles 
fish solubles are a liquid protein product used as an additive in fish meal and are also marketed as an independent product to animal feed formulators and the fertilizer industry 
the company s soluble based products are neptune fish concentrate 
this aqua grade liquid protein is composed of low molecular weight  water soluble compounds such as free amino acids  peptides and nucleotides that are attractants for a variety of aquaculture feeds 
the product is utilized in both shrimp and finfish diets to improve attractability and thus consumption and conversion 
neptune fish concentrate also can be added directly to grow out ponds as a fertilizer to help feed plankton and other natural food sources 
omegagrow 
omegagrow is a liquid soil or foliar applied fertilizer for plant nutrition 
omegagrow is approved for organic uses by the organic materials review institute omri 
omegagrow is a free flowing product that has been filtered through an mesh screen and can be applied by sprayers or through irrigation systems 
omegagrow plus 
omegagrow plus is a liquid foliar applied fertilizer for plant nutrition that also helps to control insect and fungus problems 
this product has additional oil content of to which is greater than the to oil content typically found in omegagrow tm 
these higher levels are detrimental to soft bodied insects  as well as fungal diseases in citrus and vegetable crops 
omegagrow plus can be used as a replacement for petroleum based oil sprays 
distribution system 
the company s distribution system of warehouses  tank storage facilities  vessel loading facilities  trucks  barges and railcars allows the company to service customers throughout the united states and also foreign locations 
the company owns and leases warehouses and tank storage space for storage of its products  generally at terminals along the mississippi river and tennessee river 
see properties 
the company generally contracts with third party trucking  vessel  barge and railcar companies to transport its products to and from warehouses and tank storage facilities and directly to its customers 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq grade fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of faq grade fish meal and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
in  the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil due to increasing demand for these products 
during  approximately of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products  and sales volumes that will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s meal products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
customers and marketing 
most of the company s marine protein products are sold directly to about customers by the company s marketing department  while a smaller amount is sold through independent sales agents 
product inventory was million as of december  versus million on december  the company s fish meal is sold primarily to domestic feed producers for utilization as a high protein ingredient for the swine  aquaculture  dairy and pet food industries 
fish oil sales primarily involve export markets where the fish oil is used for aquaculture feeds and is refined for use as a hydrogenated edible oil 
the company s products are sold both in the us and internationally 
international sales consist mainly of fish oil sales to norway  canada  china  chile and mexico 
the company s sales in these foreign markets are denominated in us dollars and not directly affected by currency fluctuations 
such sales could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a number of countries in which the company currently sells products impose various tariffs and duties  none of which have a significant impact on the company s foreign sales 
certain of these duties are being reduced annually for certain countries under the north american free trade agreement and the uruguay round agreement of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
in all cases  the company s products are shipped to its customers either by fob shipping point or cif terms  and therefore  the customer is responsible for any tariffs  duties or other levies imposed on the company s products sold into these markets 
during the off season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the fishing season 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are often significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  primarily other global sources of fish meal and oil  and also soybean meal for its fish meal products  and vegetable oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable oils 
quality control 
the company believes that maintaining high standards of quality in all aspects of its manufacturing operations play an important part in its ability to attract and retain customers and maintain its competitive position 
to that end  the company has adopted strict quality control systems and procedures designed to test the quality aspects of its products  such as protein content and digestibility 
the company regularly reviews  updates and modifies these systems and procedures as appropriate 
purchases and sales of third party meal and oils 
omega has from time to time purchased fish meal and fish oil from other domestic and international manufacturers 
omega has generally resold those products to international customers 
these purchase and resale transactions have been ancillary to the company s base manufacturing and sales business and revenues resulting from these activities have historically not been material 
during  the company developed a business plan to expand its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products and engaged a full time consultant to implement the company s business plan which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions 
the company supplemented its inventories and subsequent sales by purchasing other fish meal products primarily panamanian and mexican fish meal and u 
s menhaden oil 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
during  the company purchased products totaling approximately  tons  or approximately of total volume sales 
insurance 
the company maintains insurance against physical loss and damage to its assets  coverage against liabilities to third parties it may incur in the course of its operations  as well as workers compensation  united states longshoremen s and harbor workers compensation act and jones act coverage 
assets are insured at replacement cost  market value or assessed earning power 
the company s limits for liability coverage are statutory or million 
the million limit is comprised of several excess liability policies  which are subject to deductibles  underlying limits and exclusions 
the company believes its insurance coverage to be in such form  against such risks  for such amounts and subject to such deductibles and self retentions as are prudent and normal for its operations 
the company does not carry insurance against terrorist attacks  or against business interruption  in large part because of the high costs of such insurance 
a general hardening of the world insurance markets in recent years has made the company s insurance more costly and is likely to continue to increase the company s cost of insurance 
the company has elected to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
competition 
the marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as archer daniels midland and cargill 
in addition  but to a lesser extent  the company competes with smaller domestic privately owned menhaden fishing companies and international marine protein and oil producers  including scandinavian herring processors and south american anchovy and sardine processors 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources and more extensive operations than the company 
omega competes on price  quality and performance characteristics of its products  such as protein level and amino acid profile in the case of fish meal 
the principal competition for the company s fish meal and fish solubles is from other global production of marine proteins as well as other protein sources such as soybean meal and other vegetable or animal protein products 
the company believes  however  that these other non marine sources are not complete substitutes because fish meal offers nutritional values not contained in such other sources 
other globally produced fish oils provide the primary market competition for the company s fish oil  as well as soybean and palm oil  from time to time 
fish meal prices have historically borne a relationship to prevailing soybean meal prices  while prices for fish oil are generally influenced by prices for vegetable fats and oils  such as soybean and palm oils 
thus  the prices for the company s products are established by worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and tend to fluctuate significantly over the course of a year and from year to year 
regulation 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the locations and periods in which fishing may be conducted as well as environmental and safety matters 
at the state and local level  certain state and local government agencies have either enacted legislation and to prohibit  restrict or regulate menhaden fishing within their jurisdictional waters 
in january  the state of new jersey enacted legislation which extended an existing mile no fishing zone for menhaden an additional miles offshore 
omega historically has caught an immaterial amount of its fish catch in the newly closed area and believes that this restriction will have no material effect on the company s operations or financial results 
omega remains able to conduct its fishing operations off the new jersey coast outside this new three mile limit 
the company  through its operation of fishing vessels  is subject to the jurisdiction of the us coast guard  the national transportation safety board and the us customs service 
the us coast guard and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including the federal clean water act  which imposes strict controls against the discharge of pollutants in reportable quantities  and along with the oil pollution act  imposes substantial liability for the costs of oil removal  remediation and damages 
the company s operations also are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  which imposes liability  without regard to fault  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of any hazardous substances into the environment  and the federal occupational safety and health act osha 
the implementation of continuing safety and environmental regulations from these authorities could result in additional requirements and procedures for the company and it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the osha hazard communications standard  the environmental protection agency community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and similar state statutes require the company to organize information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations 
certain of this information must be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local citizens 
numerous other environmental laws and regulations  along with similar state laws  also apply to the operations of the company  and all such laws and regulations are subject to change 
the company has made  and anticipates that it will make in the future  expenditures in the ordinary course of its business in connection with environmental matters 
such expenditures have not been material in the past and are not expected to be material in the future 
however  there is no assurance that environmental laws and regulations enacted in the future will not require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the company s operations 
the company continually monitors regulations which affect fish meal and fish oil in the united states and in those foreign jurisdictions where its sells its products 
in some cases  particularly in europe  regulators have mandated various environmental contaminant levels which  on occasion  certain of the company s products do not meet 
in those instances  the company has either negotiated a lower price with the customer for that product lot or has sold the product lot in another market where the regulatory standards are met 
to date  such regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the company s business  but it is possible they may do so in the future 
in that event  the company would likely install contaminant cleaning technology which would involve undetermined amounts of capital expenditures and possibly higher costs to produce the company s product 
the company s harvesting operations are subject to the shipping act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of transportation  maritime administration which require  among other things  that the company be incorporated under the laws of the us or a state  the company s chief executive officer be a us citizen  no more of the company s directors be non citizens than a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least of the company s outstanding capital stock including a majority of the company s voting capital stock be owned by us citizens 
if the company fails to observe any of these requirements  it will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in us jurisdictional waters 
such a loss of eligibility would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to protect against such loss of eligibility  the company s articles of incorporation i contain provisions limiting the aggregate percentage ownership by non citizens of each class of the company s capital stock to no more than of the outstanding shares of each such class the permitted percentage so that any purported transfer to non citizens of shares in excess of the permitted percentage will be ineffective as against the company for all purposes including for purposes of voting  dividends and any other distribution  upon liquidation or otherwise  ii provide for a dual stock certificate system to determine such ownership pursuant to which certificates representing shares of company common stock bear legends that designate such certificates as either citizen or non citizen depending on the citizenship of the owner  and iii permit the company s board of directors to make such determinations as may reasonably be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement restrictive limitations on those shares that exceed the permitted percentage the excess shares 
for example  the company s board is authorized  among other things  to redeem for cash upon written notice any excess shares in order to reduce the aggregate ownership by non citizens to the permitted percentage 
the company believes that during the past five years it has substantially complied with all material statutes and regulations applicable to its operations  the failure to comply with which would have had a material adverse impact on its operations 
employees at december   during the company s off season  the company employed approximately persons 
at august   during the peak of the company s fishing season  the company employed approximately persons 
approximately employees at the company s virginia facility are represented by an affiliate of the united food and commercial workers union 
during the past five years omega has not experienced any strike or work stoppage which has had a material impact on its operations 
the company considers its employee relations to be generally satisfactory

the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include faq grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and regular and value added fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  particularly other globally produced fish meal and fish oil as well as other animal proteins and soybean meal for its fish meal products and vegetable fats and oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable fats and oils 
the fish catch is processed into faq grade fish meal  specialty fish meals  fish oils and fish solubles at the company s four operating plants located in virginia  mississippi and louisiana 
the company utilized fishing vessels and spotter craft in the harvesting operations during menhaden are harvested offshore the us mid atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts 
in  the company converted several of its fishing vessels to carry vessels which do not engage in active fishing but instead carry fish from the company s offshore fishing vessels to its plants 
utilization of carry vessels increases the amount of time that certain of the company s fishing vessels remain offshore fishing productive waters and therefore increases the company s fish catch per vessel employed 
the carry vessels have reduced crews and crew expenses and incur less maintenance cost then the actual fishing vessels 
harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
during  the company experienced a poor fish catch approximately below expectations and a similar reduction from  combined with poor oil yields 
the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions and the poor oil yields due to the reduced fat content of the fish 
as a result of the poor fish catch and reduced yields  the company experienced significantly higher per unit product costs approximately increase during compared to the impact of higher cost inventories and fewer volumes available for sale will be carried forward and will adversely affect the company s earnings through the first and second quarter of markets 
during and continuing through  world grain and oilseed markets were burdened by excess supplies relative to demand which  in turn  resulted in prices for most major commodities being sharply lower than in previous years 
correspondingly  the company s product prices were adversely impacted during these periods  resulting in decreased gross margins 
during and again during  the company determined that the costs of its fish meal and fish oil product inventories were in excess of those products realization value by approximately million and million  respectively 
this realization was due mainly to the continuing depressed market values of world protein markets and particularly  animal and oilseed oil markets 
the average prices received for the company s fish meal and fish oil products were approximately and lower  respectively  during as compared to price decreases continued during and fish meal and fish oil prices were approximately and  respectively  lower than average prices 
also impacting and contributing to the write down of inventories was the reduced crude fish oil production yields approximately lower yields compared to experienced during the majority of the fishing season in the gulf of mexico 
these reduced yields were primarily a result of the reduced fat content in the fish 
the depressed pricing conditions of years and continued into the early months of before making significant improvements late in and continuing throughout and these price increases were the result of diminished global fish meal and fish oil inventories as opposed to a weaker world demand for other competing products 
management believes that it is possible that these price increases have reached a plateau and stabilized at this time 
future product price volatility will depend upon the perceived international availability of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
accordingly  gross profit margins may vary in the future 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  in fiscal the company embarked on a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products have increased approximately 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependant upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure tm  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure tm or how long it may take to develop these markets 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for due to increasing demand for these products 
during  approximately of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles nets and other total liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to the national marine fisheries finance program under title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for capital expenditures and payment of long term debt 
the company expects to finance future expenditures through internally generated cash flows and  if necessary  through funds available from the credit facility and or title xi facilities described below 
under a program offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs pursuant to title xi  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shoreside construction 
the company used the entire million amount originally authorized under the program 
loans are now available under similar terms pursuant to the title xi program without intervening lenders 
the company borrowed million under this new program during and closed an additional million title xi loan on december  the company announced in april   that it had committed to build a new metric ton per day fish oil processing facility at its reedville  virginia location 
construction on the project began in june  with projected completion in the summer of and will cost approximately million 
the company currently anticipates that it will fund the project through its available cash balances 
omega had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   up million from december  this increase was due primarily to operating profits as a result of increased selling prices for the company s products and the receipt of proceeds of the million title xi loan closed in december the company s liquidity is greatly influenced by the selling prices received for its products 
should the company experience decreased pricing in the future  as it experienced in and  liquidity would decline and the company would possibly have to utilize its working capital credit facility 
the company s long term debt at december  and was million and million  respectively 
current maturities attributable to the company s long term debt was million at december  and million at december   respectively 
the company did not utilize its working capital credit facility during and other than for million and million in standby letters of credit as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had million available under its working capital credit facility 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases and standby letters of credit 
the following tables aggregate information about the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases minimum pension liability total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total less than year to years to years after years credit facility standby letters of credit construction commitment total commercial commitments as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings outstanding under the million credit facility other than million in stand by letters of credit 
the company announced on april  that it had committed to build a new metric ton per day fish oil processing facility at its reedville  virginia location 
construction on the project began in june  with projected completion in summer of and a projected cost of approximately million 
the company currently anticipates that it will fund the project through its available cash balances 
as of december  the company had incurred million related to its reedville processing facility 
the company s investing activities in  and consisted mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases  replacements and vessel refurbishments 
the company anticipates making approximately million of capital expenditures in  of which approximately million will be dedicated to the new fish oil processing facility and the remainder will be used to refurbish vessels and plant assets and to repair certain equipment 
due to million in proceeds from title xi and other borrowings and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  net financial activities provided million in in  financial activities used million 
in  financial activities provided  primarily due to proceeds from title xi borrowings of million 
on december   the company entered into a three year million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit facility 
borrowings under this facility may be used for working capital and capital expenditures 
on may   the company amended the existing credit facility and among other things  these amendments extended the maturity until december   deleted certain existing financial covenants and added certain affirmative covenants such as  a leverage ratio covenant not to exceed to at any time and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant not to be less than to as of the end of each month  measured for the twelve month period then ended 
the company is required to comply with the financial covenants from and after the last day of any month in which the credit facility s availability is less than million on any date  or the credit facility s availability averages less than million for any calendar month 
a commitment fee of basis points per annum is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility 
if at any time the company s loan outstanding under the credit facility is million or greater  the commitment fee on the unused portion shall be basis points per annum 
applicable interest is payable at alternative rates of libor plus or prime plus 
the applicable interest rate shall be adjusted up or down prospectively on a quarterly basis from libor plus to libor plus or at the company s option prime plus to prime plus depending upon the fixed charge coverage ratio being greater than times to less than or equal to times  respectively 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s trade receivables  inventory and equipment 
in addition  the credit facility does not allow for the payment of cash dividends or stock repurchases and also limits capital expenditures and investments 
the company was in compliance with the credit facility covenants at december  as of december  the company had no cash borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
at december  and december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and million  respectively  issued primarily in support of worker s compensation insurance programs 
the company s principal raw material is menhaden  a species of fish that inhabits coastal and inland tidal waters in the united states 
menhaden are undesirable for direct human consumption due to their small size  prominent bones and high oil content 
certain state agencies impose resource depletion restrictions on menhaden pursuant to fisheries management legislation or regulations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its fish catch or results of operations as a result of these restrictions 
the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods distributors although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 
in january  the united states supreme court ruled that  in addition to the united states coast guard  the occupational safety and health administration has the authority to regulate working conditions aboard certain types of vessels which include the company s fishing vessels 
the eventual implementation of this ruling which is expected to occur over a period of years is expected to result in additional safety requirements and procedures for the company s vessels 
it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liability for employees aboard its vessels collectively  vessel claims insurance 
the typical vessel claims insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible aad for which the company remains responsible  while the insurance carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the aad 
it is the company s policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim 
once payments exceed the aad  the company records an insurance receivable for a given policy year 
in  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the policy period october  through march  filed for bankruptcy protection 
this bankruptcy filing caused the company to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for a significant portion of the amounts due to the company from the insurance carrier 
in  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the period october  through september   and for of the company s jones act claims for the period october  through march  was declared insolvent by a state insurance regulator 
the company had previously provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for all the amount due to the company from the insurance carrier 
a general hardening of the world insurance markets in recent years has made the company s insurance more costly in recent years and is likely to continue to increase the company s cost of insurance 
in response  the company has elected to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these requiring difficult or complex judgments in any particular period involve the costing of inventory  including inventory lower of cost or market analyses and the company s accounting for various losses on self insurance retentions 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations generally preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed and includes both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares to total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially 
revisions in such estimates or actual results could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
as mentioned previously  the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessel 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the aad for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience  assumptions and consultation with outside counsel 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
the company has recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company estimates income or expense related to the pension plan based on actuarial assumptions  including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of its pension obligations 
based on historical data and discussions with its actuary  omega determines its expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term rate of return on its plan assets and the market related value of its plan assets 
changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in estimated pension income or expense 
the company will revise its assumptions on an annual basis based upon changes in current interest rates  return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of the workforce 
these assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings

the revised disclosure requirements are required for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  and the interim period requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  seasonal and quarterly results the company s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature 
the company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased product availability  but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off season 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  from time to time the company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the company s products which may affect comparable period comparisons 
quarterly financial data contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report are incorporated herein by reference 
risk factors and significant factors that may affect forward looking statements the company wishes to caution investors that the following significant factors  and those factors described elsewhere in this report  other filings by the company with the sec from time to time and press releases issued by the company  could affect the company s actual results which may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest  which is subject to fluctuation due to natural conditions over which the company has no control  such as varying fish population  adverse weather conditions and disease 
the impact on the company if its spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during the company s fishing season 
for example  as a direct result of the september  terrorist attacks  the secretary of transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft including the company s fish spotting aircraft for approximately nine days 
this loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered the company s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product 
the impact on the prices for the company s products of worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year 
the products that influence the supply and demand relationship are world supplies of fish meal made from other fish species  animal proteins and fats  palm oil  soy meal and oil  and other edible oils 
the impact of a violation by the company of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to menhaden fishing and the protection of the environment and the health and safety of its employees or of the adoption of new laws or regulations at federal  state or local levels that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations that materially adversely affect the company s business 
the impact of the enactment of increasingly stringent regulations regarding contaminants in fish meal or fish oil by foreign countries or the united states 
more stringent regulations may result in the company s incurrence of additional capital expenditures on contaminant reduction technology in order to meet the requirements of those jurisdictions  and possibly higher production costs for company s products  or the company s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions 
the impact on the company if it cannot harvest menhaden in us jurisdictional waters if the company fails to comply with us citizenship ownership requirements 
risks inherent in the company s attempt to expand into sales of refined  food grade fish oils for consumption in the us  including the unproven market for this product 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results due to the seasonality of the company s business and the company s deferral of sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products 
the ability of the company to retain and recruit key officers and qualified personnel  vessel captains and crewmembers 
risks associated with the strength of local currencies of the countries in which its products are sold  changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations and international trade  including changes in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in such countries  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade  changes in tax or other laws  partial or total expatriation  currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  the disruption of labor  political disturbances  insurrection or war and the effect of requirements of partial local ownership of operations in certain countries 
in the future the company may undertake acquisitions  although there is no assurance this will occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will e able to profitably manage future businesses it may acquire or successfully integrate future businesses it may acquire into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a general hardening of the world insurance markets in recent years has made the company s insurance more costly and is likely to continue to increase the company s cost of insurance 
the company has elected to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial condition of the company is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on the company s borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
although the company sells products in foreign countries  all of the company s revenues are billed and paid for in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the company is exposed to any significant foreign country currency exchange risk  and the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
