item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we design  manufacture  market and sell a comprehensive range of high quality  cost effective sound navigation and ranging sonar and global positioning system gps products and digital mapping systems under two different brand names for use in marine  general consumer includes outdoor recreational use and vehicular navigation systems and aviation markets 
our sonar and combination sonar gps products graphically display underwater information and are used as fishfinders  navigational and safety devices by both inland  coastal and offshore fishermen as well as recreational boaters 
our handheld and portable gps products are used in avionic and vehicular navigational applications and by outdoor enthusiasts for camping  hunting  hiking and other recreational uses 
currently  we offer approximately different marine  outdoor  aviation and original equipment manufacturer products 
we market our products to dealers  distributors  mass merchants and original equipment manufacturers who in turn sell our products in the consumer marketplace 
demand for our products has historically been seasonal  with the lowest sales occurring in our first fiscal quarter august through october and the highest sales occurring in our third fiscal quarter february through april due to marine consumer purchases during the beginning of the fishing season 
we focus on developing product lines that address most price points in our markets in order to provide a broad range of features to consumers 
we have increased the number of new product introductions in each of the last three fiscal years and the current fiscal year 
for the fiscal year  we introduced more than new sonar and gps products 
the introduction of new products in the last three fiscal years has resulted in the increase in sales and gross margin discussed below 
our successful operations and strong competitive position are dependent to a great extent upon our ability to anticipate and react to the technological innovations inherent within our industry 
to augment our continued investment in product research and development  we utilize several manufacturing and design technologies  which have been essential to the development of our breakthrough sonar and gps products 
these advanced technologies have allowed us to reduce our material and manufacturing costs and have provided improved product performance 
they include surface mount technology smt production equipment  computer aided design cad systems  application specific integrated circuits asics  tape automated bonding tab  chip on flex cof  chip on glass cog  system on chip soc  and liquid crystal display lcd assembly 
we believe that we were first to utilize many of these manufacturing and design technologies  which helped provide a competitive advantage and differentiation in the marketplace 
we intend to continue our focus on developing and delivering leading edge products based upon our innovations 
our products are sold domestically and in countries throughout the world 
international sales totaled approximately million  or of total net sales for fiscal and million  or of total net sales for fiscal the majority of our international sales are conducted in canada  australia and europe 
as of july   we had approximately  wholesalers and retailers purchasing our products 
executive summary during the three fiscal years ended july   we noted sales for fiscal were million  a increase from fiscal sales for fiscal were million  an increase from fiscal fully diluted net income per share for fiscal was  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal gross profit margin increased by million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit margin increased by million in fiscal  a increase from fiscal as part of an on going commitment to develop new technology and improve existing technology  we hired thirteen additional engineers in fiscal and seven additional engineers in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal after hiring six additional engineers in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate the estimates and assumptions on an on going basis 
we are not aware of any circumstances in the past which have caused these estimates and assumptions to be materially wrong 
we are not currently aware of any material changes in our business that might cause these assumptions or estimates to differ significantly 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the product warranty reserve and the excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  differences between actual results and our estimates have not been material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ivof this annual report on form k 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment in accordance with our fob  shipping point terms of sale 
revenue is recorded net of certain reserves for dealer premium coupons and product returns which are only accepted on a limited case by case basis 
dealer premium coupons are rebates ranging from to to qualified boat and motor dealers who install sonar units for consumers and return to us the appropriate rebate card 
although the reserves for dealer premium coupons and product returns fluctuate over time  historically those fluctuations have not been significant 
product warranties the majority of our sales are made under a one year product warranty 
we provide an estimate of future warranty costs based on recent historical product unit return rates and the average repair costs per unit incurred during the year 
the estimate is adjusted  as necessary  for any specific knowledge that would impact the historical trend 
the reserve for warranty costs is sensitive to a change in the historical rate of units returned during the warranty period 
a change in the expected return rate for fiscal would change the reserve by approximately  historically  the average change in the estimated return rate has been less than 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  net of excess  obsolete and realization reserves 
we estimate the level of reserves based upon expected usage information for raw materials and historical selling trends for finished goods 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are recorded by comparing available quantities of raw materials and finished goods to work order requirements for those raw materials and forecasted sales for finished goods 
we adjust the required reserves for anticipated changes in scheduled work orders resulting from factors such as process or design changes that impact the raw materials usage and changes in sales forecasts resulting in changes in finished goods quantities 
increases or decreases in the required excess and obsolete inventory reserves impact our gross margin 
a change in the results of this process for the year ended july  would change the required reserve by approximately  historical fluctuations in this reserve have related primarily to inventory levels and the ability to accurately forecast product needs  although process and design changes in the products also have a direct impact on the required reserve when they occur

during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we began shipping our new sonar gps products 
the new products include new sonar units at most previously available price points  including two within our largest volume price point  plus six new stand alone gps units 
in addition  one of the new sonar units created a new price point for us at  while one of the new sonar gps navigation units created another new price point for us at  total net sales increased by million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  while total unit sales increased by approximately 
this year over year increase in sales is due primarily to the new products introduced during fiscal the two new units within our largest volume price point and the new price point of represent high volume  lower price point units  which resulted in a larger increase in unit sales relative to the increase in net sales 
our gross profit margin increased by million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the gross margin percentage increased to as compared to in fiscal as a result of increased sales volume  which reduced the fixed overhead costs per unit  as well as product cost reductions

the effective tax rates were and  respectively  for the fiscal years ended july  and the effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates due to the impact of foreign taxes  the united states treatment of foreign operations  state taxes and permanent differences in the treatment of items from an income tax versus financial reporting perspective 
the change in effective tax rates is primarily due to foreign taxes that do not fluctuate in direct proportion to our consolidated income 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as described in section j of the securities exchange act of liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures  working capital and interest payments 
our capital expenditures relate primarily to new product tooling and our manufacturing facility 
working capital is required principally to fund inventory through payments to suppliers and manufacturing payroll costs until the inventory is sold and the receivables are collected 
our working capital requirements are seasonal and vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  timing of shipments and the payment cycles of our customers and suppliers 
sources of capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  our credit facility and lease financing 
our credit facility consists of a million revolving credit line and initial term loans of million with a july  remaining balance of  requiring monthly payments of  plus interest 
the line of credit includes a borrowing base of of qualifying accounts receivable  of qualifying raw material inventory and of qualifying finished goods inventory with borrowings from inventories limited to million 
at july   we had million available under the revolving credit line 
since the execution of this credit facility  we have on numerous occasions amended the facility to  among other things  reset certain financial covenants 
in particular  during november we amended our credit facility to extend the term of the agreement for the revolving credit line from december  to december  significant provisions of the amendment include changes in certain financial covenants  the lowering of the interest rate from prime plus to prime plus on all loans under the facility and the addition of libor based interest rate options 
in addition  the amendment allows for a permanent million seasonal overadvance facility 
effective may   the interest rate was lowered to prime plus and the libor based interest rate options were also reduced 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum fixed charge ratio  limit the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
additionally  the credit facility limits the amount of operating leases  capital expenditures and capital leases and prohibits the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lender 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants at july   except we exceeded the annual million limit on capital expenditures 
the bank waived this covenant violation 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher net income during fiscal as compared to fiscal cash used for capital expenditures was million 
an additional million in capital expenditures was funded by capital lease borrowings 
the capital expenditures primarily related to new product tooling  manufacturing equipment and computer equipment 
discontinued finished goods inventory attributable to fiscal product decisions was approximately  at july  as compared to  at july  inventory on hand at july  for products we expect to discontinue during fiscal was million 
all discontinued inventories are carried at cost  which management believes to be lower than expected realizable value 
we expect the remaining inventory of discontinued products to be sold during fiscal management monitors all inventories via various inventory control and review processes which include  but are not limited to  forecast review and inventory reduction meetings  graphical presentations and forecast versus inventory status reports 
management believes these processes are adequate 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to increased inventory levels in fiscal compared to decreased inventory levels in fiscal  which was partially offset by higher earnings in fiscal cash flows from operating activities were utilized to fund capital expenditures of million and reduce debt by million 
an additional million in capital expenditures was funded by capital lease borrowings 
the capital expenditures primarily related to new product tooling  manufacturing equipment and computer equipment 
demand for our products is seasonal 
we utilize the revolving credit line to address our seasonal liquidity needs 
management believes the sources of liquidity discussed above are adequate to satisfy our current working capital and capital equipment needs 
however  if we decide to pursue future acquisitions or make capital expenditures not currently anticipated  we may need to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be made that we will be able to raise such capital on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the company has filed a registration statement on form s to sell  shares of stock which  when completed  would provide additional liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of july  less more than than dollars in thousands year years years years total long term debt   capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations   open purchase orders   capital expenditure commitments total    the long term debt and capital lease obligations line items presented in the table above include an estimated interest portion 
the open purchase orders are subject to change or cancellation 
effects of inflation a significant portion of our costs and expenses consist of materials  supplies  salaries and wages that are affected by inflation 
in addition  certain electronic parts that are in high industry demand are subject to market driven price increases 
we may not be able to pass on the full effect of inflationary increases in our selling prices in the near term 
accordingly  we concentrate on changes in design  manufacturing processes  material scheduling and sourcing to help contain costs 
a significant portion of our raw material items are sourced overseas 
significant devaluation of the dollar relative to these currencies would not be able to be passed on in the form of price increases to consumers
