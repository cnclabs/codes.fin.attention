item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the annual report and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this annual report 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for cancer based on our telomerase technology  and cell based therapeutics using our human embryonic stem cell technology 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue related to license and research agreements with collaborators  royalties  milestone payments and government grants 
our revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the end user and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from license and research agreements with collaborators 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under these collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred 
we recognize milestone fees upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments received which has not been earned 
we also have several license  option and marketing agreements with various oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production companies 
with each of these agreements  we may receive nonrefundable license payments in cash or equity securities  option payments in cash or equity securities  royalties on future sales of products  milestone payments  or any combination of these items 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize option payments as revenue over the period of the option agreement 
we recognize milestone payments upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
we generally recognize royalties as revenue upon receipt 
we receive income from united states government grants that support our research efforts in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
income associated with these grants is recognized upon receipt of reimbursement and is included in interest and other income on the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the projected future life of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated lives have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future lives of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
intangible asset and research funding obligation in may  we completed the acquisition of roslin bio med ltd  a privately held company formed by the roslin institute in midlothian  scotland 
in connection with this acquisition  we formed a research collaboration with the roslin institute and committed approximately  in research funding over six years 
using an effective interest rate of  this research funding obligation had a net present value of  at the acquisition date and was capitalized as an intangible asset that is being amortized as research and development expense over the six year funding period 
imputed interest is also being accreted to the value of the research funding obligation and is recognized as interest expense 
at the time of acquisition  we estimated the effective interest rate and have been evaluating the spending rate under the collaboration as compared to the contractual funding period 
revisions in the effective interest rate or amortization period would have the effect of increasing or decreasing research and development expense as well as the balance of intangible assets and research funding obligation on the balance sheet 
as of december   no revisions to the effective interest rate or amortization period have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
valuation of equity instruments as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas we elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are generally not required under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are required by sfas to present  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the pro forma effects on reported net income and earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas in valuing our options using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the option grant date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the weighted average expected lives of the options is based on historical experience of option exercises 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the option and increase or decrease the pro forma effect on reported net income and earnings per share if the compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method 
as of december   no revisions to the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
in valuing our warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the warrants 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the warrant issue date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the weighted average expected lives of the warrants is based on the term of the warrant 
upon issuance of a warrant to consultants or collaborators  we recognize an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
upon issuance of warrants in connection with an equity financing  we recognize issuance costs with an offset to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the warrant and increase or decrease the expense or issuance cost recognized upon issuance of the warrant 
as of december   no revisions to the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a therapeutic product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy and safety  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of  in compared to  in and million in revenues in primarily reflected cost reimbursements from consulting contracts 
revenues in primarily reflected the final research support payment from our collaborative agreement with kyowa hakko 
in  kyowa hakko completed their research funding to us as contractually agreed 
we received million in funding payments under the kyowa hakko agreement in we did not receive any funding payments from kyowa hakko in or revenues in primarily represented research support payments from our collaborative agreement with kyowa hakko and our collaborative agreement with pharmacia  which ended in we recognized million in revenue for funding payments received under the pharmacia agreement in we recognize revenue under collaborative agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license and option fee revenues of   and  in  and  respectively related to our various agreements 
also  we received royalties of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market and cell based research products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in   each in   and  thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future results 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a reduction in personnel related costs of approximately million associated with restructurings in june and january and a reduction in external research support costs of approximately  the increase in from was primarily the result of increased costs of million related to raw materials and manufacturing expenses for our telomerase inhibitor compounds 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next year as we continue to incur expenses related to manufacturing and testing of our telomerase inhibitor compounds and continue development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs 
our research and development activities can be divided into two major categories of related programs  oncology and hesc therapies 
the oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc project  and the percentage allocations of time changes as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
research and development expenses allocated to programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology hesc therapies total in our oncology area  we have concentrated our resources in two programs telomerase inhibitor compounds and telomerase therapeutic vaccines 
our telomerase inhibitor compounds  grn and grnl  are in preclinical animal toxicology and efficacy studies 
we hope to complete the preclinical studies successfully during  after which we expect to prepare and file an ind application 
a telomerase therapeutic vaccine for patients with metastatic prostate cancer is currently in a phase i ii clinical study at duke university medical center 
in our hesc therapy programs  we have concentrated our resources on several specific cell types 
we have developed proprietary methods to derive  maintain and scale up undifferentiated hescs and differentiate them into therapeutically relevant cells 
we are now testing six different therapeutic cell types in animal models 
in three of these cell types  we have preliminary results indicating efficacy as evidenced by functional recovery of the treated animals 
after completion of these studies  we expect to begin one or more phase i clinical trials  most likely including treatment for spinal cord injury 
at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to complete the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii  and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  on average it takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict 
our clinical development programs are updated and changed periodically to reflect the most recent preclinical and clinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot assure you that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and other countries  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products and entry into clinical trials with one or more product candidates may not result in any commercially viable products in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was the result of a reduction in personnel related costs of  as a of result of the restructuring announced in january  partially offset by increased external accounting and legal costs of  the decrease in from was due to a reduction in personnel related costs of  as a result of the restructuring announced in june  a reduction in business consulting expenses of million and a reduction in legal expenses of million 
we expect general and administrative expenses to approximate current levels in the next year 
interest and other income interest income was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was the net result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher cash and investment balances in the fourth quarter of the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and decreasing cash and investment balances 
interest earned in the future will depend on any future funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we also received   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively and recorded these amounts as other income in each year 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future with the conclusion of our national consortium drug discovery group grant award from the national cancer institute 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense in and was primarily the result of reduced equipment loan payments 
conversion expense in connection with the restructuring agreement for our series d convertible debentures in november  we modified the terms of million of our outstanding series d convertible debentures by reducing the conversion price to of the closing bid price on the date of conversion by the investor and  as a result  we recorded million as conversion expense in the conversion expense was calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the common stock issued on the date of conversion and the fair market value of common stock that would have been issued under the original agreement 
also in november  we modified the terms of the remaining million of our series d convertible debentures to extend the maturity date to june   increase the yield on the debenture to  and fix the conversion price at per share 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related warrants that were originally issued with our series d convertible debentures to reset the exercise price of of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to june  series d warrants and of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to december  series d warrants 
the difference between the current fair values of the original series d warrants and the amended series d and d warrants was recorded as conversion expense of million 
we also recorded the remaining million of amended series d convertible debentures at a fair value of million with the offsetting difference of million being recorded as conversion expense 
the fair values used in calculating the conversion expense associated with the series d and d warrants and the amended series d convertible debentures were based on values determined through the assistance of an independent valuation 
in may  we modified the existing terms of the outstanding million series d convertible debentures to provide for an automatic conversion into equity on the maturity date  to fix the conversion price at per share and to eliminate the interest accrual for the remainder of the term 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related outstanding warrants to change the exercise prices to per share 
the warrant expiration periods were unchanged 
the difference between the current fair values of the existing series d and d warrants and the amended series d and d warrants was recorded as conversion expense of  we also recorded the amended series d convertible debentures at a fair value of  with the difference of  being recorded as conversion expense 
the remaining excess of the fair value over the face value of the debentures from the first modification of  was recognized as a reduction to conversion expense 
the interest accrued through the date of the second modification was added to the outstanding principal balance 
no further interest accruals were required after the date of the second modification 
in calculating the conversion expense associated with the amended series d and d warrants  we used the black scholes valuation model to determine fair values 
the conversion expense associated with the amended series d convertible debentures was based on the fair value of the underlying common stock 
during may and june  all of the remaining million of series d convertible debentures plus accrued interest of  were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
as of december   no series d convertible debentures remained outstanding 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock expired on july  without having been exercised 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock remained outstanding as of december  net loss net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of reduced revenues partially offset by decreased operating expenses 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of reduced revenues from collaborative agreements partially offset by lower conversion expense related to convertible debentures 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of two equity financings in which resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of cash used in operations 
net cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the decrease in net cash used in operations in was due to reduced operating expenses  primarily the result of the restructuring announced in january the increase in net cash used in operations in was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses and a decrease in revenues 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through an equipment financing arrangement 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total    and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our equipment financing facilities 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facilities expires on september  we intend to renew the commitment for new equipment financing facilities in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  then we will need to spend our own resources for equipment purchases 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
in april  we sold  shares of geron common stock to two investors at per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in june  geron entered into a licensing agreement with transgenomic  inc covering manufacture of phosphoramidate and thio phosphoramidate oligonucleotides for our telomerase inhibitor compounds  grn and grnl 
in connection with the agreement  transgenomic purchased  shares of geron common stock at per share in addition to paying a non refundable cash license fee 
in a separate collaboration research agreement between the two companies  a research fee was paid to transgenomic  inc in may  we modified the existing terms of the outstanding million series d convertible debentures to provide for an automatic conversion into equity on the maturity date  to fix the conversion price at per share and to eliminate the interest accrual for the remainder of the term 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related outstanding warrants to change the exercise prices to per share 
the warrant expiration periods were unchanged 
during may and june  all of the remaining million of series d convertible debentures plus accrued interest of  were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
as of december   no series d convertible debentures remained outstanding 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock expired on july  without having been exercised 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock remained outstanding as of december  in january  we reduced our research staff by employees and our support staff by employees 
we restructured our organization in order to concentrate our resources on the continued development of our lead anti cancer product candidates  grn and grnl  and our human embryonic stem cell therapy programs 
we recorded a restructuring charge in the first quarter of of approximately  of which  was recorded as research and development expense and  was recorded as general and administrative expense 
as of december   no further amounts were due as a result of this restructuring 
our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter are as follows principal payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years amounts in thousands equipment loans operating leases research funding total contractual cash obligations this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various academic laboratories around the world  including the roslin institute 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facilities will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through june  changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities with three financial institutions in the united states 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore  bear minimal risk 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of high grade corporate bonds and us government agency securities 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
for the year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  our financial obligations to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next two years 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
