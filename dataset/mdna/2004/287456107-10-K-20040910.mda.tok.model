item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations executive overview elkcorp  through its subsidiaries  is a leading manufacturer of elk premium roofing and other building products 
in addition  our subsidiaries provide technologically advanced products and services to other industries 
we strive to be the brand of choice in each of our businesses 
building products is our dominant business  accounting for of consolidated sales in fiscal our building products segment consists of elk premium building products  inc and its operating subsidiaries collectively elk 
these companies manufacture premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles  coated and non coated nonwoven fabrics used in asphalt shingles and other applications in the building and construction  filtration  floor coverings and other industries  and nontoxic composite wood decking  railing  marine dock and fencing products 
the focus of these businesses is innovative product development  manufacturing excellence and superior customer service 
we target our roofing products toward the steep sloped roofing market 
this market was favorable again in fiscal as elk s shingle shipments increased compared to fiscal and average selling prices increased 
higher raw material costs  particularly asphalt  were a continuing concern throughout fiscal  but we were able to maintain improved margins of shingle pricing over raw material costs during the year compared to the prior fiscal year 
we anticipate raw material and transportation costs to continue to increase moderately in the near term  but also believe these higher costs can be offset by price increases implemented in late fiscal and announced for early fiscal we expect that industry shipments of laminated asphalt shingles will continue to grow to annually for the next several years and we are taking steps to meet increasing demand for our products 
a major initiative to improve manufacturing capacity was accomplished in fiscal  when we completed a second shingle manufacturing plant at the tuscaloosa  alabama facility ahead of schedule and under budget 
this new plant will increase our overall capacity by about 
we expect the start up of this new facility to negatively impact operating results in the early part of fiscal  but expect the new plant to contribute to our operating profit as fiscal progresses 
we also completed capacity additions in fiscal at our shafter  california and myerstown  pennsylvania plants 
our key strategy in fiscal in performance nonwoven fabrics and composite building products was to position these businesses as core growth platforms 
for performance nonwoven fabrics  our primary objectives were to achieve higher capacity utilization and grow internal and external mat shipments in line with growth in the roofing market 
for composite building products  our goal in fiscal was to attain profitable operations through improved manufacturing results 
this objective was achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the introduction of a new voided product line  which reduced product weight without sacrificing strength  lowered raw material content and allowed higher extrusion speeds 
we intend to significantly increase the composite building products line in fiscal with the investment of approximately  to expand the capabilities of our current composite lumber operations in lenexa  kansas 
start up of this expanded facility will negatively impact operating results initially  but is expected to improve operating income in the second half of fiscal our dissimilar businesses are combined and reported as other  technologies  as none individually meet the materiality criteria for separate segment reporting 
these operations include ortloff engineers  ltd ortloff  which provides proprietary technologies and related engineering services to the natural gas processing industry  chromium corporation chromium  which is a leading provider of hard chrome and other surface finishes designed to extend the life of steel machinery components operating in abrasive environments  and elk technologies  inc  which develops and markets fabrics featuring versashield fire retardant coatings designed for use outside of traditional building products applications  including home furnishings and other consumer products 
to date this business has produced a nominal amount of commercial sales 
our primary objectives for these businesses in fiscal were to position chromium and ortloff for sustained long term profitability and become the supplier of choice in selected consumer fire barrier markets 
we were successful in fiscal in that chromium and ortloff were each profitable 
however  these companies do not fit into our focus on building products platforms  and we are positioning them for sale in the next fiscal year 

table of contents we continue to be excited about the potential of our fire barrier products 
this business is not yet generating significant revenues 
however  in fiscal  several additional bedding makers chose our technology for fire resistant mattresses 
new open flame fire standards are expected to be adopted in the state of california in january and national distribution of code compliant product is expected next fiscal year 
in december  we made the decision to discontinue cybershield  inc cybershield and to sell cybershield or its assets 
a significant portion of the current year loss for cybershield relates to the write down of assets to estimated market value as a result of this decision 
the lufkin  texas facility and its operations were sold august  the idle canton  georgia facility is currently held for sale 
performance data the following table and subsequent discussion set forth performance data from our continuing operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
this data and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
year ended june  sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative other selling  general and administrative noncash stock option compensation income from operations interest expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance sales from continuing operations of  in fiscal were higher than  in fiscal during fiscal  income from continuing operations of  was higher than  for the prior year 
included in income from continuing operations last year was  of benefit  net of tax  from the reversal of noncash stock option compensation 
income from continuing operations in fiscal was higher than pro forma income from continuing operations of  in fiscal which excludes the  after tax stock option compensation benefit in the prior year 
for comparative purposes  management believes this comparison is appropriate  since the fiscal benefit resulted solely from changes in our stock price and not from operations 
consolidated income from operations of  in fiscal was higher than  in fiscal income from operations in the prior year included a  pretax benefit as a result of the aforementioned noncash stock option compensation 
consolidated operating income from fiscal was higher than pro forma consolidated operating income from continuing operations of  which excludes the  noncash stock option compensation benefit in the prior year 
for comparative purposes  management believes this comparison is appropriate  since the fiscal benefit resulted solely from changes in our stock price and not from operations 

table of contents cost of sales was of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal higher asphalt and other raw material costs during much of fiscal were largely offset by better shingle pricing and increased shingle production  which reduced per unit manufacturing costs 
other selling  general and administrative other sg a costs in fiscal were higher than in the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased business activity and higher marketing expenses  however  as a percentage of sales  the relationship between sales and other sg a costs was better in the current year than in fiscal interest expense  net  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  interest expense of  was capitalized related to the construction of an additional shingle plant in tuscaloosa  alabama  and other significant capital projects 
in fiscal   of interest was capitalized 
the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in both fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate from continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to state tax credits generated as a result of roofing plant production improvement initiatives 
in december  we made the decision to exit cybershield s business 
cybershield s results for all periods presented are reported as discontinued operations 
discontinued operations for fiscal included a  pretax loss from operations  combined with pretax  noncash write downs of  to reduce the book value of cybershield s assets to estimated market value 
in fiscal  cybershield reported a  pretax operating loss  all from operating activities 
results of business segments sales in the building products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the significant year to year increase in sales is primarily the result of an  or  increase in premium roofing products sales 
compared to the same period last year  unit shingle shipments increased  with most regions of the united states of america experiencing strong year to year growth 
a significant portion of the unit volume increase  particularly during the early part of fiscal  was attributable to strong roof replacement demand in hail damaged texas markets 
average shingle pricing increased about compared to the year ago period 
in fiscal  external sales of performance nonwoven fabrics increased  or  compared to last year 
approximately two thirds of roofing mat produced in both fiscal and fiscal was used for internal consumption 
internal sales of roofing mat are eliminated in consolidation 
sales of composite building products were  in fiscal we entered the composite wood business in the second quarter of fiscal and reported  in sales last year 
operating income for the building products segment of  for fiscal increased compared to  achieved in fiscal operating income gains attributable to higher unit sales and pricing were partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses  raw material price increases  higher transportation costs and unusually high developmental costs related to new product offerings in the roofing business 
we also incurred an operating loss of approximately  for the composite wood business during fiscal compared to an approximate  operating loss in fiscal the composite wood business achieved profitability in march and generated approximately  of operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal the other  technologies companies reported combined sales of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal ortloff recognized lower license fee and consulting income in fiscal compared to license fees can vary significantly between reporting periods since this business is largely project driven 
chromium s sales were higher in fiscal compared to as a result of increased demand for plating and finishing services in existing locomotive and marine markets  combined with increased hard chrome wear plate sales 
during the first quarter of fiscal  chromium and the electro motive division of general motors gm emd signed a manufacturer s representation agreement whereby gm emd will promote and market chromium s reciprocating engine components through the extensive gm emd sales network in international and specific domestic markets 
elk technologies had a nominal level of sales of fire retardant mattress fabrics during fiscal other  technologies companies had combined operating income of  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal due to higher sales activity levels  chromium had an operating profit of approximately 
table of contents  in fiscal year compared to incurring a small operating loss in fiscal ortloff had operating income of approximately  in fiscal  compared to approximately  operating income in fiscal elk technologies incurred approximately  in marketing and development costs in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   income from continuing operations of  was higher than  in fiscal sales from continuing operations of  were higher in fiscal than sales of  in fiscal consolidated operating income from continuing operations of  in fiscal was higher than  in the prior fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal included a  benefit from the reversal of noncash stock option compensation  compared to a  charge for this noncash item in fiscal in fiscal  we changed our accounting for certain stock options from fixed awards with no compensation expense to variable awards  which generally results in periodic expense or income  as we determined that variable accounting was more appropriate for such stock options 
pursuant to variable option accounting  income is charged or credited during each accounting period to reflect any excess or deficit of the market value of shares underlying vested options  from the exercise price of vested options 
based on a decline in our share price subsequent to june  and actions taken by the board of directors to terminate the feature of the incentive stock option plan that caused certain stock options to be accounted for as variable awards  we recorded a reversal of the majority of fiscal noncash stock option compensation in the first quarter of fiscal we now have no options subject to variable stock option accounting 
accordingly  subsequent to the quarter ended september   income was not affected by variable accounting for stock options 
operating income from continuing operations in fiscal also included a favorable settlement with a vendor resulting in  of income 
as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of sales were of sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the impact of higher asphalt costs in fiscal were partially offset by  among other things  lower unit manufacturing costs and strict management of controllable expenses at our roofing plants 
other selling  general and administrative other sg a costs in fiscal were  higher than in fiscal however  fiscal benefited from a  vendor settlement 
as a percentage of sales  other sg a costs were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal interest expense  net was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the company capitalized  of interest related to the construction of an additional tuscaloosa  alabama shingle plant and other significant capital projects 
no interest cost was capitalized in fiscal the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the difference between years primarily relates to the impact of noncash stock option compensation on the effective tax rate 
results of business segments sales in the building products segment increased to  for the year ended june  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  premium roofing sales  which represented of building products segment sales  increased compared to fiscal unit shingle shipments in the last half of fiscal more than offset the impact of a general slowing in the roofing market early in fiscal the increase in demand for our premium roofing products was driven by strong roof replacement demand in the texas market as a result of widespread spring hail damage 
roofing activity in the northeast and midwest areas of the united states was hampered in the latter part of fiscal by persistent record rainfall from april to mid june for the year  unit shingle shipments in fiscal increased over fiscal for the month of june  unit shingle shipments set a company record 
average selling prices for premium laminated asphalt shingles were about higher in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily as a result of shingle price increases in the second half of fiscal to recover higher asphalt costs and increases in other energy related costs 
however  the increases in unit sales and average selling prices were somewhat offset by a sales mix weighted proportionately more to lower priced products 

table of contents in fiscal  outside sales of performance nonwoven fabrics  which represented of building product sales  decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a weak commercial roofing market 
although overall production of nonwoven fabrics was comparable in fiscal to the prior fiscal year  in fiscal a much higher proportion of nonwoven fabric production was consumed internally in our own manufacturing of shingle products 
intercompany nonwoven fabrics sales are eliminated in consolidation 
composite building products  which began operations in october  accounted for of building products sales in fiscal despite increased sales in fiscal  operating income for the building products segment of  was lower compared to  in fiscal prior year operating income included a  favorable vendor settlement 
asphalt costs in fiscal were  higher than in the prior fiscal year 
approximately  of these higher asphalt costs were offset by higher average sales per shingle unit 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  shingle inventories were repositioned into the texas market from other geographic areas to meet strong demand and to serve our texas market share 
higher freight transfer costs related to inventory repositioning negatively impacted fiscal operating earnings by approximately  in fiscal  delayed delivery and production inefficiencies related to the start up of newly installed composite building products equipment reduced building products operating income for the year by approximately the other  technologies companies reported combined sales of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal ortloff achieved a increase in licensing revenues  primarily as a result of several key international projects in fiscal higher international licensing fees are the result of our strategy of establishing cooperative marketing or licensing arrangements with several key international suppliers of process technologies  providing ortloff with the opportunity to bid its technology packages on large international projects that might not otherwise be available to it 
licensing revenues can vary significantly between reporting periods since this business is largely project driven 
chromium sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of deferred maintenance expenditures by its railroad customers 
the other  technologies companies reported operating income of  in fiscal  higher than  in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher technology licensing fees generated in fiscal chromium reported an approximate  operating loss in fiscal compared to a modest operating profit in fiscal start up costs relating to elk technologies  inc also reduced operating income in fiscal by approximately  fiscal and results have been restated for cybershield  which became a discontinued operation for accounting and reporting purposes in fiscal in fiscal  cybershield incurred an approximate  operating loss compared to an approximate  operating loss in fiscal the fiscal loss included  of plant closure costs relating to cybershield s canton  georgia plant 
significantly reduced volumes in the cellular handset business caused cybershield s sales to decline significantly in fiscal cellular handset production previously in the united states and latin america largely shifted to asia where the company had no significant operations 
new accounting standards there are no new accounting pronouncements that have not been adopted which impact the company 
financial condition overview our liquidity needs generally arise principally from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and payment of dividends 
during the three years ended june   we have relied primarily on internally generated funds and proceeds from sales of senior unsecured notes to finance our capital expenditure requirements 
our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements are higher in the spring and summer months and lower in the fall and winter months 
we generally use our revolving credit facility facility to finance higher working capital requirements 
there were no borrowings under the facility during the current fiscal year until mid march 
table of contents during the spring months of  our borrowings increased to about  before being reduced to  at june  borrowing activity in fiscal was representative of our expected seasonal liquidity trends and requirements 
operating activities we determine cash flows from operating activities primarily from income from operations  deferred taxes  depreciation and amortization 
cash flows also either increase or decrease by changes in working capital requirements 
in fiscal  we generated cash flows of  from operating activities  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal our overall working capital level related to continuing operations at june  was not significantly different than it was at june   increasing about  trade receivables at june  were slightly higher than at june  due to higher sales levels 
in accordance with normal industry practices  extended payment terms are granted to certain customers for roofing products shipped during the late winter and early spring months  with payments generally due during the spring and early summer 
at june   receivables from customer programs with extended due dates were  compared to  at june  extended term receivables outstanding at june  are due in the first quarter of fiscal at june   inventories were  higher than at june  we believe our inventories are being maintained at historically appropriate levels 
the current ratio was to at june  compared to to at june  investing activities cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect our capital expenditure strategy 
net cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal approximately  of current year capital expenditures relate to the construction of a second shingle manufacturing plant at the tuscaloosa  alabama facility  including the installation of certain infrastructure and material handling improvements designed to enhance the overall efficiency of the expanded facility 
construction of the facility and testing of production equipment has been completed and the plant was placed in service july  other significant capital expenditures in fiscal included approximately  for productivity enhancement projects 
we also invested approximately  to upgrade certain key information technology platforms  which are expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal in fiscal  we are investing approximately  to expand the capabilities of our composite lumber facility in lenexa  kansas 
additional capacity from these investments is expected to be available in december excluding major capacity initiatives such as the lenexa expansion  consolidated ordinary levels of capital expenditures are generally expected to be approximately  to  per year for the near term 
financing activities cash flows from financing activities generally reflect changes in our borrowings  together with dividends paid on common stock  treasury stock transactions and exercises of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  compared to  provided in fiscal and  used in fiscal during fiscal  we increased the primary credit available under our facility from  to  and extended its maturity to november  in june  we finalized an agreement to issue an additional  in senior unsecured notes in a private placement transaction with a group of institutional investors 
closing on this agreement was deferred until november   subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions 
these financing steps were initiated in a historically low interest rate environment to provide funds for growth and expansion initiatives  including possible acquisitions to extend our premium building products line of business 
at june   liquidity consisted of  of cash and  of available borrowings under the  committed facility 
the debt to capital ratio after deducting cash of  from  of principal debt was 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 

table of contents our board of directors has authorized our repurchase of common stock from time to time on the open market 
as of june   we have repurchase authority of approximately  remaining 
we did not make any open market purchases of common stock in fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future payments relating to contractual obligations at june  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases plant construction commitments total contractual obligations in addition to the amounts reflected in the table  we will have an incremental  of senior unsecured notes  scheduled to be closed in november  that will be due after five years 
interest expense is not included in the above table as interest on floating rate obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
interest on fixed interest rate obligations in place at june  is  per year through fiscal as a result of an interest rate swap in july   of annual interest will be converted from a fixed to floating rate through july interest payments on  of senior unsecured notes schedule to be closed in november will increase interest expense an additional  per year 
our only other significant commercial commitment at june  is our  revolving credit facility  the term of which extends through november  environmental our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such laws and regulations are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
certain of our manufacturing operations utilize hazardous materials in their production processes 
as a result  we incur costs for remediation activities off site and at our facilities from time to time 
we establish and maintain reserves for such remediation activities  when appropriate 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions we believe are reasonable based on the information available 
the accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 
collectibility of accounts receivable the majority of our sales are in the building products segment and our primary customers are building materials distributors 
due to consolidation in the industry  credit risk is concentrated 
ten customers typically account for approximately of consolidated sales 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivables based on a combination of factors 
the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated on an ongoing basis based on such factors as customer s past payment history  length of time the receivables are past due  the status of customer s financial condition and ongoing credit evaluations 
accruals for loss contingencies contingencies  or uncertainties  by their nature  require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of loss 
accruals are established 
table of contents for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated reasonably 
accrual balances are reviewed and adjusted periodically based on our judgment of changes in specific facts and circumstances for each loss accrual 
key loss accruals for the company include product warranties product warranties are estimated and recorded based on factors such as an examination of known defects for potential exposure  claims paid history  independent data as to average length of time between asphalt roofing replacements and average length of home ownership 
litigation litigation reserves are determined on a case specific basis from evaluations by both management and outside counsel as to any probable exposure from litigation capable of reasonable estimation 
environmental exposure environmental exposure  primarily related to other  technologies companies  is evaluated by management and our environmental consultants when known or anticipated exposure is identified and quantifiable 
self insurance reserves we partially insure ourself against losses for both casualty and medical insurance 
reserves are calculated and maintained based on historical experience and specifically identified losses 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventories based on various factors 
for the building products segment  adjustments may be made to inventory values based on the physical condition eg age and quality of the inventories 
for the other  technologies companies  inventory adjustments are generally based upon the forecasted plans to sell their products and the sales prices that are expected to be realized 
inventories are adjusted to the lower of cost or market or written off if unsaleable 
these adjustments are estimates and can vary from actual requirements if inventories deteriorate  become otherwise damaged or obsolete  or if competitive conditions differ from expectations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
the majority of sales are for manufactured products  where revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
such revenues  particularly in the building products segment  are subject to returns  discounts  volume rebates and other incentives  which are estimated and recorded based on sales activity and historical trends 
differences in revenues could result if actual experience differs from the historical trends used in management s estimates 
license revenue recognition is recorded when the following conditions are all complete a a customer contracts for the nonexclusive use of inventions covered by our patents  b there are no remaining items relating to the license contract that have to be accomplished  and c the license fee is nonrefundable 
service revenues are recognized as they are performed 
revenue recognition may be subject to judgment and interpretation that the specific requirements of sab have been met 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  primarily plant  property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the estimated sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  industry conditions  customer requirements  technology or our business model 

table of contents market risks in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices and interest rates 
we have no significant foreign exchange risk 
derivatives are held as part of a formally documented risk management program 
derivatives are held to mitigate uncertainty  volatility or to cover underlying exposures 
no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
we have entered into derivative transactions related to interest rate risk and our exposure to fluctuating prices of natural gas used in our manufacturing plants  as summarized in the following paragraphs 
we are required to purchase natural gas for use in our manufacturing facilities 
these purchases expose us to the risk of higher natural gas prices 
to hedge this risk  we may enter into hedge transactions to fix the price on a portion of our projected natural gas usage 
there are no natural gas hedge transactions in effect at june  however  it is anticipated that hedging strategies will likely be utilized in the future 
we use interest rate swaps to help maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt 
we have entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of our outstanding debt at june  the fair value of this swap was  at june  in july  we entered into an additional interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on an additional  of our outstanding debt 
based on outstanding debt at june   our annual interest costs would increase or decrease  for each theoretical increase or decrease in the floating interest rate 
after an additional  of senior unsecured notes are funded in november  and after considering the additional interest rate swap entered into in july  our interest costs would increase or decrease  annually for each theoretical increase or decrease in the floating rate 
credit risk we are subject to credit risks applicable to cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and derivative instruments 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions or in short term investments with high credit quality 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable primarily relate to the large building materials distributors that are our primary customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have not experienced significant credit losses for many years 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to those customers to whom we make significant sales 
our largest customer accounted for and of consolidated sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively
