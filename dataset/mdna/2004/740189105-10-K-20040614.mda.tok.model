item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview fiscal was another challenging  yet successful  year for precision castparts corp 
pcc or the company 
during the past two years  the company has faced significant challenges in its core aerospace and power generation markets  where weak economic conditions have continued to reduce demand for products used in commercial aircraft and industrial gas turbines 
pcc has responded to these declining market conditions by continuing to aggressively cut costs and improve operating performance 
this focus on operational excellence has led to substantial share gains in pcc s core markets  and is generating strong operating margins despite declining leverage from the lower sales volume 
in addition  the company continues to consider acquisition and divestiture strategies designed to strengthen and build upon pcc s core businesses  technologies and customer relationships 
in december  pcc acquired sps technologies  inc sps  a leading world wide supplier of highly engineered fasteners and other metal products sold principally to the aerospace and automotive markets 
this acquisition is an excellent fit with pcc  and it provides abundant opportunities for realization of value added synergies and sales growth 
also in fiscal  pcc continued to divest non core businesses that did not fit the company s strategy for long term profitable growth  including three businesses that were part of the sps organization 
overall  the company is well positioned to achieve strong operating performance in fiscal  and to leverage earnings as economic conditions in the aerospace and power generation markets improve 
total sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of million  or percent from fiscal sales of  million 
the addition of the sps businesses for weeks of the year contributed million to the current year sales 
excluding sps  the company experienced a million  or decline in sales  principally affecting the investment cast products and forged products segments due to weak demand from the aerospace and power generation markets 
total aerospace sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of sps 
as a percent of total sales  fiscal aerospace sales remained flat at compared to fiscal power generation sales dropped percent from fiscal levels  and declined from percent of total sales in fiscal to percent of total sales in fiscal sales to the fluid management market increased percent from fiscal  and increased from percent of total sales in fiscal to percent of total sales in fiscal sales to the general industrial and other markets grew by percent  and the automotive market grew by over  primarily due to the acquisition of sps 
cost of goods sold was  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal as compared to  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the slight increase in the percentage reflects the impact of declining leverage from lower sales volume  higher depreciation and pension expenses  increased raw material costs and higher costs associated with sps  partially offset by strong performance improvements throughout the company  most significantly within the industrial products segments 
selling and administrative expenses were million  or percent of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the flat year over year percentage was due to significant cost reductions throughout the company  offset by the negative impact of the lower sales volume and the addition of sps  which has a higher percentage of selling and administrative expenses compared to pcc s base businesses 
net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share diluted  which included restructuring and asset impairment charges in the second and fourth quarters totaling per share and other expense associated with financing the sps acquisition of per share 
by comparison  net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share diluted  which included restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters totaling per share  offset by benefits from insurance settlements in the second quarter of per share and favorable tax settlements in the fourth quarter of per share 
fiscal net income after discontinued operations was million  or per share diluted  compared with million  or per share diluted in fiscal business acquisitions on december   pcc acquired percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of sps technologies  inc the results of sps operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
the acquisition of sps is expected to strengthen and build upon the company s core businesses  technologies and customer relationships 
in addition  sps complementary manufacturing processes provide the company with opportunities to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs throughout sps  resulting in anticipated improvements in operating margins 
the aggregate purchase price was million  which included million of cash  pcc common stock valued at million and million of cash paid for transaction fees 
in addition  sps paid million for change of control payments and transaction fees as of the close of the transaction 
the value of the million shares of pcc common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was determined based on the quoted market price of pcc s common stock on and around the date of the close of the transaction 
sps is a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace  automotive  and general industrial markets 
sps former specialty materials and alloys group operates as part of the investment cast products segment 
a new segment  fastener products  comprises most of sps former aerospace fasteners and engineered fasteners groups 
sps former tool group operates as part of the industrial products segment 
in addition  three former sps businesses magnetics  mohawk  and dacar were classified as held for sale in the third quarter  and their results are included in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred asset impairment and disposal charges associated with its decision to sell newmans  a valve distribution company within the fluid management products segment 
it was determined that newmans distribution business did not fit with pcc s manufacturing focused operations and was not performing to the company s expectations 
the newmans business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  three businesses acquired in the sps transaction magnetics  mohawk  and dacar were classified as held for sale and their results were included in precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries discontinued operations 
they were classified as discontinued operations because they were deemed to be non core to the company and do not meet pcc s long term strategy 
pcc is currently marketing the operations for sale 
in fiscal  pcc incurred charges associated with the closure or sale of certain businesses within its fluid management products and industrial products segments 
the pcc olofsson and eldorado machine businesses were closed and the eldorado gundrill tooling business was sold 
in addition  the company sold its controlling interest in design technologies international dti and certain intangible assets of olofsson to minority shareholders of dti 
the closure or sale of these operations was in response to a steady and continual decline in the machine tool industry over the past several years 
in addition  pcc closed stw composites stw as it was deemed to be a non core business to pcc 
pcc also entered into agreements to sell barber industries and fastener engineers lewis machine felm and began actively marketing pcc superior fabrication for sale in the fourth quarter 
barber industries and felm were both sold during the first quarter and pcc superior fabrication was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal these businesses did not fit with the company s long term strategy for profitable growth 
olofsson  eldorado  dti  stw  superior fabrication  felm  barber and newmans each meet the criteria as a component of an entity under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in the company s consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
in addition  the company recorded disposal expenses in fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively  related to the write down of remaining inventory and property  plant and equipment to fair value less cost to sell  the write down of accounts receivable and other current assets to net realizable value  and incremental costs directly related to the closure or sale of the businesses  such as pension  severance and lease termination costs 
restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges the following table provides significant components of amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income related to the company s restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal provision for restructuring severance other impairment of long lived assets the following table provides a rollforward of amounts included in accrued liabilities for restructuring reserves fiscal restructuring reserve at beginning of period provision continuing operations provision discontinued operations utilization restructuring reserve at end of period during fiscal  pcc recorded provisions for restructuring and impairment of long lived assets totaling million 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
these charges are summarized below the company recorded million of restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal primarily for severance associated with headcount reductions at pcc s investment castings operations in the united kingdom and the company s forging operations in the united kingdom and houston  texas 
the reductions were in response to reduced demand for commercial aerospace and industrial gas turbine products 
the restructuring plans provided for termination of approximately employees 
the tax effected impact of these charges totaled million  or per share diluted 
the company recorded million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal to provide for severance associated with the consolidation of the reed rico thread rolling facility in holden  massachusetts  into the newly acquired sps thread rolling operations in shannon  ireland  further consolidation of the european valve production operations within the fluid management products segment and severance associated with headcount reductions at certain domestic operations within the fluid management products segment 
the restructuring plans called for termination of approximately employees through the second quarter of fiscal the tax effected impact of these charges totaled million  or per share diluted 
in conjunction with the consolidation of the reed rico and sps thread rolling operations  redundant equipment at reed rico was written down to net realizable value  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
the tax effected impact of these charges totaled million  or per share diluted 
taking into consideration the current uncertainties in the markets served by the company  pcc continuously assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions 
based on the company s most recent assessment  there are no current plans to restructure operations in fiscal other expense income other expense of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect the write off of unamortized bank fees million from early termination of bank credit facilities and the termination of an interest rate swap million associated with debt refinancing  both in connection with the sps acquisition 
outlook the company expects that aerospace sales will improve slightly in fiscal principally due to increased deliveries of commercial aircraft and higher sales of aftermarket spares 
the power precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries generation market will continue to decline in fiscal due to lower sales of industrial gas turbine components in north america  partially offset by the impact of higher demand in asia  market share gains  requirements for igt spares  and higher sales of seamless pipe 
other markets served by the company are expected to be relatively flat  or slightly improved from fiscal overall sales are expected to grow by approximately percent from fiscal  primarily due to a full year of results from the sps acquisition 
excluding the sales contributed by sps  sales will be up slightly year over year 
operating margins in the company s base businesses are expected to have modest improvement over fiscal levels due to the benefit of restructuring activities taken during the past year  coupled with continued cost take outs throughout the company and the slightly higher sales levels 
operating margins at sps are also expected to improve due to continued realization of synergies 
financial results by segment pcc has organized the company s business segments along its five major product lines and reports financial results in the following five segments investment cast products  forged products  fastener products  fluid management products and industrial products 
operating income amounts discussed below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges 
to facilitate comparisons with fiscal  the following segment operating income amounts reported for fiscal have been adjusted to account for the impact of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fiscal as reported goodwill amortization adjusted segment operating income investment cast products forged products fluid management products industrial products corporate expense operating income investment cast products the investment cast products segment includes pcc structurals  pcc airfoils  and the newly acquired sps specialty materials and alloys group smag 
these businesses manufacture investment castings  or provide materials and alloys  for aircraft engines  industrial gas turbine igt engines  airframes  armaments  medical prostheses and other industrial applications 
fiscal compared with fiscal investment cast products reported fiscal sales of  million and operating income of million  or percent of sales 
fiscal sales decreased percent from the prior year s  million  and operating income decreased by percent over the prior year s million  or percent of sales 
the addition of sps smag businesses in december contributed million of sales and million of operating income  or percent of sales  to fiscal results 
the overall sales decline compared to fiscal was due to continued weakness in both the aerospace and power generation markets  combined with the impact of price reductions 
despite the sales decline and higher raw material costs compared to fiscal  the investment cast products segment was able to achieve solid operating margins due to continued aggressive cost takeout throughout its operations and improvements in manufacturing performance 
the investment cast products segment anticipates higher sales associated with the aerospace market  partially offset by continued declines in the power generation market in fiscal operating margins are expected to improve in fiscal as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiency 
fiscal compared with fiscal investment cast products reported fiscal sales of  million and operating income of million  or percent of sales 
fiscal sales decreased percent from the prior year s  million  and operating income decreased by percent over the prior year s million  or percent of sales 
the sales decline was due to weakness in both the aerospace and power generation markets  combined with the impact of price reductions 
despite the significant decline  the investment cast products segment was able to improve operating margins year over year due to cost takeouts throughout its operations 
forged products the forged products segment consists of the forging operations of wyman gordon 
forged products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the investment cast products segment  with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components 
the forged products segment also produces seamless pipe and other products for the oil and gas industry 
fiscal compared with fiscal forged products reported sales of million for fiscal  a decrease of million  with operating income of million  or percent of sales  a decrease of million from the fiscal level of million  or percent of sales 
the sales decline was due to reduced demand for commercial aerospace products as well as products for the power generation market  partially offset by increased demand for military aerospace products 
operating margins within this segment are significantly impacted by the deleveraging effect of the sales decline due to the capital intensive nature of the forging business 
higher raw material costs  which represents a significant percentage of overall costs  as well as price concessions  also reduced operating margins 
cost reductions and benefits from settlement of a supply agreement between wyman gordon and timet helped to partially offset the impact of these items 
sales in fiscal within this segment are expected to benefit from the recovering aerospace market and anticipated growth in extruded pipe sales  partially offset by continued weakness in the industrial gas turbine market 
operating income will benefit from the slightly higher sales and continued improvements in operating efficiency 
fiscal compared with fiscal forged products reported sales of million for fiscal  a decrease of million  with operating income of million  or percent of sales  a decrease of million from the fiscal level of million  or percent of sales 
the sales decline was due to reduced demand for commercial precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries aerospace products as well as products for the power generation market  partially offset by military aerospace sales 
the operating margins were impacted by the deleveraging effect of the sales decline in this capital intensive segment 
cost reductions  market share gains and improved value stream management have helped to mitigate the impact of the lower sales volume 
fastener products the fastener products segment includes most of sps former aerospace fasteners and engineered fasteners groups that were acquired in december the businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners  fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace  automotive and industrial machinery markets 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment recorded sales of million of sales and operating income of million  or percent of sales  for the year  which included approximately weeks of activity since pcc acquired sps on december  since its acquisition  the fastener products segment has rapidly achieved cost reductions and synergies  while also increasing market share in airframe and aircraft engine sectors and opening up share gain opportunities with major automotive customers 
the fastener products segment will continue to benefit from additional opportunities for cost reductions and synergies in fiscal and beyond 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment was not part of the company in fiscal or fluid management products the fluid management products segment includes all of the businesses of pcc flow technologies 
the businesses that comprise this segment manufacture an extensive range of fluid management products under various brand names  which include paco  johnston and crown pumps for water and wastewater treatment  new construction  energy  and other applications  e one grinder pumps for low pressure sewer systems  and general valve  tbv  techno  pcc ball valves  sterom  aop  baronshire  valtaco  reiss  technova  wouter witzel  cw and convey valves for oil and gas  fuel distribution  food processing  severe services and other applications 
fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal sales for fluid management products were million  as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
the segment s operating income decreased from million  or percent of sales  in fiscal to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the slight decline in sales was due to lower sales in the power generation market and oil and gas sectors  partially offset by higher sales in the municipal and chemical processing sectors 
operating margins were flat despite the lower sales volume as a result of lower costs from offshore production and additional purchasing leverage  coupled with an improved cost structure resulting from restructuring efforts completed during fiscal and overall  the fluid management products segment is expected to benefit from an increased backlog and modest revenue growth in fiscal operating margins are expected to improve slightly as the year progresses due to the higher volume and the impact of low cost manufacturing facilities in china and romania 
with an improved cost structure  the segment is positioned to penetrate new and existing markets 
fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal sales for fluid management products were million  as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
the segment s operating income increased from million  or percent of sales  in fiscal to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the sales improvement was due to higher sales in the oil and gas and municipal sectors  partially offset by lower sales in the power generation and chemical sectors 
operating margins improved due to the higher sales volume  coupled with increased offshore production  additional purchasing leverage and manufacturing efficiencies 
industrial products the industrial products segment includes j l fiber services  advanced forming technology aft and the precision tool group 
j l fiber services produces refiner plates and screen cylinders for use in the pulp and paper industry and rebuilds refiner equipment that is used in the pulping process 
aft manufactures metal injection molded  metal matrix composite  and thixoformed components for numerous industrial applications 
the pcc precision tool group  which consists of reed rico and the sps tool group  manufactures a broad range of cold forming header and threader tools and dies 
fiscal compared with fiscal the industrial products segment s sales increased by percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and its operating income increased from million  or percent of sales  to million  or percent of sales 
the increase in sales was due to the addition of sps tool group  which contributed million of sales  as well as improved market conditions in the automotive sector and additional market penetration by the base businesses 
operating margins benefited from the higher volume  coupled with new product introductions  increased productivity and successful ramp up of production at low cost manufacturing facilities in hungary and india  partially offset by the impact of adding sps businesses  which have lower margins 
in fiscal  the industrial products segment should continue to benefit from the consolidation of reed rico and the sps tooling businesses  which will increase pcc s worldwide share of the fastener tooling market 
operating margins are expected to increase as a result of improved cost structures and leverage from higher volume 
fiscal compared with fiscal the industrial products segment s sales increased by percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and its operating income increased from million  or percent of sales  to million  or percent of sales 
the increase in sales was due to improved market conditions in the general industrial market and increased market share in the electronics and pulp and paper sectors 
operating margins benefited from the higher volume  coupled with increased productivity and successful start up of new low cost manufacturing facilities in hungary and india 
precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  as compared with million in fiscal the lower interest expense resulted from lower debt levels and lower effective borrowing rates during fiscal the effective tax rate for the year was percent  compared with percent in the prior year 
the fiscal rate included million of favorable tax settlements  decreasing the effective tax rate by percentage points 
the fiscal rate benefited from the impact of non recurring charges related to financing the sps acquisition  as well as the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at march   represented a  million increase from the  million balance at march   primarily due to the acquisition of sps  which added  million of assets 
total capitalization at march   was  million  consisting of  million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capital ratio decreased from at the end of fiscal to at march  cash requirements for the year included million for the acquisition of sps  million of pension contributions million were voluntary  million for capital expenditures  million for increased working capital  million of swap termination fees and million of loan fees  and million for dividends 
these requirements were funded by million of net income from continuing operations adjusted for million of depreciation and amortization  million of deferred income taxes and million of asset impairment charges  million from the sale of common stock through espp purchases and stock option exercises  million of proceeds from the sale of barber  felm  newmans and pcc superior fabrication  million from discontinued operations and million from other activities 
the shortfall was funded by million of net borrowings  which resulted in an ending cash balance at march  of million  up million from the fiscal ending balance 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for maintenance  expansion and cost reduction projects 
fiscal s capital spending  which is expected to be higher than spending in fiscal  principally provides for additional capital expenditures associated with sps  coupled with projects to reduce costs  maintain production and provide for improved safety throughout the company 
management believes that the company can fund requirements for working capital  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations  borrowing from existing or new bank credit facilities  issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents the significant contractual cash obligations of pcc as of march  in millions contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt  operating leases critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to pcc s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on pcc s business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  the company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
accounts receivable reserve the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where pcc is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably expects will be collected 
in addition  the company records reserves for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical write offs and current economic conditions 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the company s operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
therefore  although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecast demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of pcc s inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  the company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to the summary of significant accounting policies  fair value of financial instruments and financing arrangements sections in item notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company has variable rate debt obligations that expose the company to interest rate risk 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company terminated an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its terminated bank credit facility 
if market rates had averaged percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal or fiscal  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income  after considering the effects of the interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap  would not have been material 
foreign currency risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  however  the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies 
as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies note  the company had foreign currency hedges in place at march  and march  to reduce such exposure 
the potential loss in fair value on such financial instruments from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have been material to the financial position of the company as of the end of fiscal or fiscal material cost risk as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies note  the company had entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of strategic raw materials at march  and march  in addition  pcc had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of the company s contracts at march  and march  if market rates had averaged percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal or  the effect on the company s cost of sales and net earnings  after considering the effects of these agreements and contracts  would not have been material
