item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we base these statements on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market advanced technical ceramic products and components for defense  industrial  automotive diesel and commercial applications 
our primary products include lightweight ceramic armor for soldiers and military helicopters  ceramic orthodontic brackets  ceramic diesel engine components  ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes for microwave tubes  lasers and cathode ray tubes  and ceramic industrial components for erosion and corrosion resistant applications 
our customers include the us government  prime government contractors and large industrial and commercial manufacturers 
we conduct our operations primarily in three locations 
the following table includes a summary of our products by applications for our three divisions 
divisions products ceradyne advanced ceramic operations costa mesa and irvine  california defense applications lightweight ceramic armor industrial applications ceralloy srbsn wear parts semiconductor equipment components precision ceramics automotive diesel applications ceralloy srbsn automotive diesel engine parts ceramic armor system components for civilian vehicles commercial applications ceramic orthodontic brackets ceradyne semicon associates lexington  kentucky industrial applications ceramic impregnated dispenser cathodes for microwave tubes  lasers and cathode ray tubes samarium cobalt magnets ceradyne thermo materials scottdale and clarkston  georgia defense applications missile radomes nose cones industrial applications glass tempering rolls metallurgical tooling castable and other fused silica products crucibles for photovoltaic solar cell applications 
table of contents we categorize our products into four market applications 
the table below shows the percentage contribution to our total sales of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total the principal factor contributing to our recent growth in sales is increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers 
recent military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq  as well as an increasingly unstable geopolitical climate and the heightened risk of international conflicts  have resulted in increased orders for these products 
we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be higher in fiscal year than in however  unless we are successful in obtaining new contracts for ceramic body armor  our shipments of ceramic body armor may decline materially in from levels we expect to achieve in for the next several quarters  and perhaps longer  fluctuations in sales of ceramic body armor are likely to be the biggest factor affecting our sales 
although we expect demand for ceramic body armor to continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on our ability to successfully compete for this business 
other existing products which we believe could have a significant impact on our growth over the long term include ceramic components for heavy duty diesel truck engines and ceramic radomes nose cones for missiles 
our largest diesel engine components customer informed us in may that it will triple the number of our ceramic cam rollers  from six to  that it uses in each heavy duty diesel truck engine 
we began shipping these additional components in the fourth quarter of in may  the prime government contractor for the pac patriot advanced capability missile selected ceradyne to manufacture the technical ceramic radome blank  diamond grind the radome blank to precise tolerances and assemble and test the radome components for incorporation on the pac missile 
previously  the prime contractor made the ceramic radome blank and we performed only the diamond grinding 
the prime contractor has and will continue to provide us with funds to purchase most of the equipment and tooling required for this program  which we are installing in  square feet of the total  square foot facility that we lease in clarkston  georgia 
depending on the level of government funding for this program  we expect revenues from sales of radomes for the pac missile to increase from our historic levels and to continue for several years  if not longer 
also in may  we were selected to make radomes for the arrow missile 
we will manufacture the technical ceramic radome blank  diamond grind the radome blank to precise tolerances and assemble and test the radome components 
we expect revenues from the sales of the radomes for this system to begin in and continue for several years 
our export sales have varied  representing million  or of our net sales in  million  or in  and million  or in our export sales consist primarily of defense related products purchased by us allies  and ceramic glass tempering rolls 
we plan to increase our sales efforts in foreign countries  and we currently have sales offices in china and england  as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
all of our export sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products  which we recognize when the product is shipped to the customer 
in the past we have also received research and development funds from the us government under small business innovation research grants  and from the ford motor company pursuant to a joint development agreement 
these research and development funds  which have been relatively small in amount  have been recognized as revenue as we performed the research and development 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are 
table of contents customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which we also include in cost of product sales and expense as incurred 
selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development income from operations other income income before provision for taxes on income net income years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year 
net sales for our advanced ceramic operations division for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in net sales was mainly due to a million or increase in ceramic armor shipments for defense customers and a million increase in shipments of ceramic orthodontic brackets 
sales increases were offset by decreases in other product lines  mainly a million decrease in net sales of machined products and a million decrease in net sales of automotive diesel engine components 
our semicon associates division had net sales of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million of sales in the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to an increase in customers demand for dispenser cathodes  which are used in microwave tubes for radar and satellite communications 
our thermo materials division had net sales of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million of sales in the prior year 
the increase in sales was attributable to an increase in demand for ceramic radomes used on the pac missile  an increase in shipments of ceramic crucibles to accommodate growth in the photo voltaic solar cell industry  and revenue from the construction of the facilities that we will use to manufacture the pac missile radomes

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this form k 
in applying these policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which accounts receivable and inventory and certain liabilities are recorded and the useful lives of property and equipment 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments 
future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
future changes could also affect the estimated useful levels of property and equipment  which could result in changes in depreciation expense or write offs or write downs of such assets 
revenue recognition 
sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
we are required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
we reduce our revenue with reserves for estimated price concessions and sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no   revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical price concessions and sales returns 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes our estimate of the amount we expect to be uncollectable on specific accounts and unidentified accounts included in accounts receivable 
in estimating the potential losses on specific accounts  we rely on in house prepared analysis  historical experience and a review of other available information 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 

table of contents production tooling 
our production tooling primarily consists of graphite tooling used in the manufacturing and furnace processes 
this tooling is being amortized over its estimated useful life of three to nine months 
warranty reserve 
the us government defense logistics agency dla notified us on march   that three lots of our small arms protective inserts sapi for light weight ceramic armor shipped in january failed to pass ballistics reverification tests by the government s designated independent commercial testing laboratory 
during the period of december through march   we had shipped approximately million under our existing contract with the dla 
subsequent to march   the dla directed the independent testing laboratory to perform reverification testing and million of the shipments were not in testing compliance 
when we first were notified of these issues on march   we voluntarily stopped producing our original sapi design and thereafter actively worked with the government to understand the quality and testing issues and to resolve the status and disposition of the sapi plates in question 
we completed the development of a modified design for our ceramic sapi armor plates 
independently performed tests by the government s designated testing laboratory of the modified design were successful and the first article initial production parts of this modified design was approved in june on august   we signed an amendment to our contract with the government for certain of the sapi plates shipped in december and the first quarter the amendment required that we correct or replace at our expense all supplies of the product that did not meet the original contractual requirements 
the warranty items were delivered between october and june we estimated the cost to rework and upgrade the sapi plates at approximately  and set up a warranty reserve in that amount  recorded in the second quarter ended june  against cost of product sales 
upon completion of the cost to rework and upgrade the sapi plates  there was a remaining warranty reserve amount of  that was credited to cost of product sales during the second quarter ended june  changes in the product warranty accrual for the year ended december  were as follows warranty accrual  january  warranty expenditures remaining balance credited to cost of product sales warranty accrual  december  liquidity and capital resources we generally have met our operating and capital requirements with cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our line of credit  and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
our net cash position increased by million during the year ended december   compared to a decrease of  during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to million 
the primary factors contributing to the increase in cash flow from operating activities were net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a million reduction of income taxes payable due to the exercise of stock options  and increased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses that added an aggregate of million 
these contributions were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable of million due to higher amounts of sales over the previous year  and increased levels of inventories  production tooling and prepaid expenses that totaled million 
cash used in investing activities of was for capital expenditures of million and used to purchase marketable securities 
a majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment to gain additional capacity and improve operations 
also included in the total capital expenditures was million used to purchase a plant in irvine  california  that we formerly leased and where we produce the ceramic orthodontic brackets and machine grind diesel engine parts  and million used to acquire a plant in lexington  kentucky that we are now renovating to increase our production capacity for ceramic components for heavy duty diesel truck engines 
we plan to spend an additional million in for renovation costs 
we also plan to spend approximately million in to purchase machinery  equipment and furnaces  primarily for the new plant in kentucky 
financing activities provided cash of million generated from the net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in our public offering  described below  and million in connection with the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options under the stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash used in 
table of contents financing activities included million used to reduce our bank line of credit and  used to reduce long term debt 
our net cash position decreased by million during the twelve months ended december  an important component of this change was our investment of million for the purchase of machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements 
these capital expenditures served to fund the expansion of production capacity primarily at our advanced ceramic operations division 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million 
this was due to net income plus depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
inventories and accounts receivable increased by million due to the higher volumes of business compared to the year earlier period 
in may  we increased our revolving bank line of credit from million to million 
the bank line of credit balance of million at december  was fully repaid in july with a portion of the net proceeds from our recent public offering described below 
we established a new unsecured line of credit with a new bank in august  which expires in august the amount available under the terms of the new line of credit is million and bears interest at percentage points in excess of the libor rate for a period selected by ceradyne 
the libor rates for the periods that could be selected ranged from approximately percent to percent at december  the bank line of credit did not have an outstanding balance at december  we entered into a  capital equipment loan agreement during the third quarter of the term of this loan was months  with a prepayment penalty  and interest accrued at a fixed rate of 
in july  we repaid the entire balance due with a portion of the net proceeds from our public offering 
during july  we completed a public offering of  newly issued shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering after deducting offering expenses of million and underwriting discounts 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to  at december  at december   we had working capital of million  compared to million at december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash available from the sale of short term investments  and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
we also may utilize cash from time to time to acquire other businesses  technologies or product lines that compliment our existing business  although we have no present commitments or agreements to do so 
the company s contractual obligations are for non cancelable operating leases and are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements ceradyne does not have any off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ceradyne is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt 
currently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  as of december   we did not have any debt outstanding 
we have an unsecured line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
the bank line of credit interest rate is charged at percentage points in excess of the libor rate for a period selected by us 
the libor rates for the periods that could be selected ranged from approximately percent to percent at december
