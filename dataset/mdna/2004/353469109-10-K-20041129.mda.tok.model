results of operations overview fiscal operating results represented a significant improvement over reported results in fiscal years and our loss from operations improved million compared to fiscal and million compared to fiscal we reported a million improvement in our net loss attributable to common shareholders compared to fiscal and a million improvement compared to fiscal despite these significant improvements  we still face challenges in returning to profitable operations 
the primary factors which influenced our fiscal results of operations and which may influence our operations in future periods include the following declining sales since fiscal  we have faced declining sales for both products and training 
our consolidated sales fell million  or percent  compared to fiscal of this decline  million was due to retail store closures and million was due to decreased sales of technology products 
in order to improve sales trends  we have introduced new training and consulting offerings and products and have refreshed existing programs and products 
these efforts resulted in sales growth in our osbu segment and improved core primarily planners and binders product sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal we intend to continue our efforts to stabilize and eventually grow our sales in future periods 
reduced operating expenses over the past several fiscal years  we have actively sought to reduce our operating expenses 
our efforts have included headcount reductions  retail store closures  consolidation of administrative office space  and other initiatives designed to reduce these expenses 
as a result of these initiatives  we reduced our selling  general  and administrative expenses by million compared to fiscal and million compared to fiscal our efforts to reduce capital expenditures and focus capital spending on key projects during the past few years helped us reduce our depreciation expense by million compared to fiscal and million compared to fiscal improved cash flows from operations our cash flows from operations improved to million compared to million in fiscal and net cash used for operations of million in fiscal we improved our cash flows from operating activities despite million of additional required payments for outsourced services that were made in fiscal we also reduced our on hand inventories and realized favorable cash flows of million from reduced purchases and better inventory management practices 
as a result of these and other factors  we were able to maintain our cash and cash equivalents balance at million as of august  further details regarding these factors and their impact on our operating results and liquidity are provided throughout the following management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through loss from continuing operations before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations year ended august  product sales training and services sales total sales product cost of sales training and services cost of sales total cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative provision for losses on management stock loans impairment recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary impairment of assets depreciation amortization total operating expenses loss from operations equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiary interest income interest expense loss on interest rate swap other income loss  net loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes segment review we have two reporting segments the consumer business unit cbu and the organizational solutions business unit osbu 
the following is a brief description of these segments and their primary operating activities 
consumer business unit this business unit is primarily focused on sales to individual customers and includes the results of the company s retail stores  catalog and ecommerce operations  and other related distribution channels  including wholesale  the government  and office superstores 
the cbu results of operations also include the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although cbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic planning devices  virtually any component of the company s leadership and productivity solutions can be purchased through cbu channels 
organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of productivity  strategic execution  leadership  goal alignment  sales performance  and effective communication training solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of the organizational solutions group osg and the company s international operations 
the osg is responsible for the domestic sale and delivery of strategic execution  goal alignment  productivity  leadership  sales force performance  and communication training solutions to corporations  governmental entities  communities  and educational institutions 
the osg is also responsible for consulting services that compliment the company s productivity and leadership training solutions 
the company s international sales group includes the financial results of its directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
the following table sets forth segment sales data from continuing operations for the years indicated 
for further information regarding our reporting segments and geographic information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in thousands 
year ended august  consumer business unit retail stores    consumer direct    other cbu    organizational solutions business unit osg    international    total net sales    fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales our product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic devices that are primarily sold through our cbu channels declined million  or percent compared to the prior year 
in order to assess product sales performance we primarily analyze sales trends through our product delivery channels and the mix of products that are being sold through the channels 
the decline in product sales compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the following sales performance at cbu channels 
retail sales decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decline in retail sales was primarily attributable to the following o million of the retail sales decrease is the result of the closure of retail stores 
the company closed stores in fiscal in addition to domestic and international stores that were closed in fiscal these store closures were primarily comprised of unprofitable stores and stores located in markets where the company had multiple retail operations 
we anticipate that a portion of the sales from these closed stores will transition to one of our other product channels 
o million of the retail store decrease was the result of declining comparable store technology sales  which include handheld electronic devices  or pdas  and related products 
comparable stores are retail locations which have been open for the full year in the period reported 
technology sales have decreased as competition has increased from office product superstores and discounters 
sales of core products remained relatively flat  decreasing less than one percent compared to fiscal at august   we were operating retail stores compared to stores at august  consumer direct includes catalog and ecommerce operations sales decreased million  or two percent  compared with fiscal the primary factors affecting consumer direct sales were as follows o technology sales  including handheld electronic devices and pdas  through this channel decreased million 
o the total number of orders placed through the consumer direct channel decreased five percent from the prior year 
other cbu sales  which are comprised primarily of wholesale and government product sales  declined by million  or four percent compared to the prior year 
during our wholesale sales increased as the company expanded its product offerings in office superstores and discount stores 
offsetting this increase was decreased government products sales 
during fiscal  we outsourced the sale and distribution of our products through government channels to a well established office products distributor 
accordingly  we now only recognize royalty income from the distributor rather than the net sale and corresponding costs related to those sales 
training and services sales we offer a variety of training solutions and consulting services focused on business and personal productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  leadership  sales performance  and communication training programs provided both domestically and internationally through the osbu 
our overall training and service sales declined million  or six percent  compared to the prior year 
decreased training sales were primarily due to decreased domestic training sales through our osg  which experienced a slow start in fiscal of the million decline in domestic training sales  million occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal and was primarily attributable to decreased client facilitated leadership programs 
decreased leadership training was partially offset by increased productivity training and sales from our new program  disciplines of execution and related xq sales 
however  our training and consulting business improved significantly during late fiscal  especially in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  the booking pace for future on site programs was the strongest recorded in three years 
international sales  which represented percent of our osbu segment sales in fiscal  increased by million  or percent compared to the prior year 
international sales growth was led by our two largest international offices  located in japan and the united kingdom  which experienced growth rates of percent and percent during fiscal currency conversion also favorably impacted international results through translation of foreign sales to us dollars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations  international sales grew percent compared to the prior year 
with our renewed emphasis on providing training to enhance clients business results as well as their personal productivity and effectiveness  we believe that overall osbu training and service sales will begin to improve in future periods 
we believe that our efforts to improve training offerings will be rewarded as the general economy and hiring trends continue to improve in the united states  corporate clients restore funding to training budgets  and as our new training and consulting offerings continue to gain traction in the market 
however  there can be no certainty as to when  or if  these events may occur and what their impact might be upon our training and services sales trends 
gross margin gross margin consists of sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross margin may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
for fiscal  our overall gross margin improved to percent of sales compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in our overall gross margin was primarily due to increased margins from product sales and an increase in training and service sales as a percent of total sales 
increased gross margin on product sales and an increase in training and service sales as a percent of total sales was primarily due to a favorable shift in our product mix away from technology and specialty products to higher margin paper and binder products 
paper product sales  including forms and tabs  combined with binder product sales  increased as a percentage of total sales to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal our gross margins on paper and binder products also increased as a result of specific cost reduction initiatives 
we believe that such changes in our product mix  combined with continued aggressive cost management  will continue to produce favorable results in our product sales gross margin in future periods 
we record the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross margin may not be comparable with the gross margin of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
training solution and related services gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased to percent compared to percent the prior year 
the decline in our training gross margin during the year was primarily due to delivering some higher cost programs that are part of a longer term marketing strategy 
these activities include custom programs for certain strategic clients  multiple domestic symposium events  and a series of international events that also had lower gross margins than our other training programs 
these factors were partially offset by ongoing initiatives designed to reduce overall training program delivery costs that continue to have a favorable impact on our training and services gross margin 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
declining sg a expenses were the direct result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs and were consistent with sg a expense trends during the previous two fiscal years 
our cost reduction efforts have included retail store closures  headcount reductions  consolidation of corporate office space  and other measures designed to focus our resources on critical activities and projects 
the primary effects of these cost cutting initiatives were reflected in associate expense reductions totaling million  advertising and promotional expense reductions totaling million  reduced rent and utilities charges totaling million  and reductions in other sg a expenses  such as outsourcing and development costs  that totaled million compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these cost reduction efforts were million of additional expenses related to retail store closures  as discussed below 
although our cost reduction efforts significantly reduced our operating costs during fiscal  we will continue to pursue cost reduction efforts and initiatives to further reduce our operating expenses during fiscal in order to improve our operating results 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  which includes assessment of previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we decided to close certain stores during fiscal and fiscal the costs associated with closing retail stores are typically comprised of charges related to vacating the premises  which may include a provision for the remaining term on the lease  and severance and other personnel costs 
during fiscal  we closed retail stores and incurred additional expenses related to certain store closures that occurred during fiscal these store closure costs totaled million during fiscal and were reported as a component of our sg a expenses 
based upon our continuing analyses of retail store performance  we may close additional retail stores during fiscal  and will continue to incur costs associated with closing retail stores 
provision for losses on management common stock program prior to may  we utilized a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that were appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
based upon this systematic methodology  we recorded a million increase to the loan loss reserve during fiscal as a result of modifications to the terms of the management stock loans that were approved in may and their effects on the company and loan participants see note to our consolidated financial statements  the company determined that the management common stock loans should be accounted for as non recourse stock compensation instruments 
while this accounting treatment does not alter the legal rights associated with the loans to the participants  the modifications to the terms of the loans were deemed significant enough to adopt the non recourse accounting model 
as a result of this accounting treatment  the remaining carrying value of the notes and interest receivable related to financing common stock purchases by related parties  which totaled million prior to the accounting change  was reduced to zero with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
we currently account for the non recourse stock loans as variable stock option instruments 
compensation expense will be recognized when the fair value of the common stock held by the loan participants exceeds the fair value of the loans plus accrued interest million at august  at any time after march  however  we expect that additional compensation expense will be minimal as the loans will be due when the company s common stock price equals the sum of the principal plus accrued interest 
although we do not anticipate significant further compensation expense related to the management stock loans  this accounting treatment precludes us from recovering the amounts expensed as additions to the loan loss reserve  totaling million  which were recognized in prior periods 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these management stock loan receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain computer hardware and software assets  the prior year impairment of retail store assets  which totaled million  and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
based upon these events and current capital spending trends  we expect that depreciation expense will continue to decline compared to prior year periods during fiscal amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the reduction in our amortization expense was due to the full amortization of certain definite lived intangible assets 
we expect that amortization expense will total approximately million during fiscal income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal resulted primarily from taxes payable by foreign affiliates and from taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
these foreign taxes were partially offset by the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and a foreign income tax benefit related to our japan operations 
as of august  and  given our recent history of significant operating losses  we had provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred income tax assets 
as of august  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  which primarily related to our operations in japan 
for further information concerning deferred tax items  including our net operating loss carryforwards  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales product sales during fiscal decreased million  or nine percent  compared to fiscal the decline in product sales was primarily attributable to sales declines in our retail and consumer direct channels 
however  sales declines in the retail and consumer direct channels were partially offset by increased sales from our wholesale channel 
retail store sales declined million  or nine percent  primarily due to reduced technology sales  declining traffic  and closed stores 
the unfavorable retail sales trend was reflected in a percent decline in comparable store sales performance compared to fiscal as a result of unfavorable operating performance in certain of our retail stores  we closed retail stores in the united states and international locations during fiscal these closures were primarily comprised of unprofitable stores and stores located in markets where the company had multiple retail operations 
at august   we were operating domestic retail stores compared to domestic and international stores at august  consumer direct sales declined million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decline in consumer direct sales was primarily due to continuing trends of lower call volume through our catalog call center 
however  decreased catalog sales were partially offset by increased sales through our internet web site located at www 
franklincovey 
com 
although total sales from the consumer direct channel were down  the shift of sales from the catalog call center to the internet produced improved operating results for this channel due to the lower operating costs per transaction of our ecommerce operations 
other cbu sales improved primarily due to increased wholesale sales through our contract stationer channel  which produced a million increase compared to fiscal training and services sales training solution and related services sales during fiscal decreased by million  or six percent  compared to the prior year 
decreased domestic training sales  which are primarily delivered by our organizational solutions group  were primarily attributable to decreased sales of customized training products  the elimination of our organizational change consulting group  decreased public seminar sales  and reduced government training sales 
partially offsetting these sales decreases were increases in client facilitated workshops and productivity programs  including a new productivity workshop entitled  focus achieving your highest priorities 
international sales decreased million  or one percent  compared to the prior year 
decreased sales in mexico  canada  and europe were partially offset by increased sales in japan  the united kingdom  australia  and increased licensee royalty revenue 
gross margin our overall gross margin for fiscal improved slightly to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
gross margin on product sales decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the decline in our product gross margin was chiefly attributable to the following three factors the substantial discounting of a number of slower moving products in order to liquidate this merchandise  a shift in our product mix toward technology products  including tablet pcs and handheld electronic devices  which generally have lower gross margins than the majority of our other products  and in response to general market trends  significant promotional discounts were used on certain products to enhance sales 
partially offsetting these factors during fiscal were the favorable results from focused cost cutting initiatives aimed at reducing our production costs for paper related products and decreasing the purchase price of our binder products 
training solution and services gross margin  as a percent of sales  improved to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in the prior year 
the improvement in training solutions gross margin was primarily due to decreased sales of customized training products and the elimination of our organizational change consulting practice  both of which typically have lower gross margins than the majority of our other training solution and training product related sales 
additionally  higher margin facilitator sales continued to improve and had a favorable impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal decreased sg a expenses were the result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs 
these successful cost cutting initiatives resulted in associate expense reductions totaling million  reductions in other sg a expenses  including outsourcing  consulting  and development  that totaled million  and advertising and promotional expense reductions totaling million  compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these cost reduction efforts were additional expenses generated from closing stores in fiscal  as discussed below 
during fiscal  the company closed stores in the united states and international retail stores that were located in canada and mexico 
in connection with these store closures  we incurred and expensed million  which was recorded in sg a expenses in fiscal provision for losses on management stock loan program during fiscal and  we utilized a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that were appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
based upon this systematic methodology  we recorded a million increase to the loan loss reserve during fiscal compared to an increase of million in fiscal impairment recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary during fiscal  we entered into a joint venture agreement with american marketing systems ams to form franklin covey coaching  llc fcc 
the joint venture agreement required the company s coaching programs to achieve specified earnings thresholds in fiscal or the agreement could be terminated by ams 
based upon events and circumstances that suggested the joint venture would be terminated  we recognized impairment charges to our investment in fcc that totaled million during fiscal ams later exercised its option to terminate the existing joint venture effective august  under the provisions of a new partnership agreement that terminated the company s interest in fcc in october  the company received payments totaling million during fiscal and fiscal upon recognition of the new partnership payments  we first reduced our remaining investment in fcc at august  to zero and then recorded the additional amounts as reversals of the previously recorded impairment charges 
these impairment reversals totaled million in fiscal we will not receive any further payments from fcc 
loss on impaired assets during fiscal  we recorded an impaired asset charge of million to expense our remaining investment in agilix due to cash flow sufficiency concerns at agilix 
our loss on impaired assets in fiscal  which totaled million  consisted of several write downs of impaired assets including the covey trade name  a note receivable from the sale of subsidiary  and software costs 
for further information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain computer hardware and software as well as significantly reduced capital expenditures  especially for store build outs and remodeling projects  during fiscal and fiscal however  these factors were partially offset by million of impairment charges and additional depreciation on property and equipment at retail stores that we closed 
during fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges on property and equipment in retail stores that was also recorded as a component of depreciation expense 
amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million compared to million during fiscal equity in the earnings losses of an unconsolidated subsidiary our fiscal loss of million represents our portion of the losses from our approximately percent ownership interest in agilix 
as previously discussed  during fiscal we impaired our remaining investment of approximately million and have no further obligations to agilix 
accordingly  we do not expect to record any further losses related to this investment 
our fiscal earnings of million represent our share of fcc s net income 
following the termination of the previous fcc partnership agreement on august   we ceased recording our share of fcc s income 
refer to the discussion above under impairment recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary regarding our treatment of payments from fcc under the new partnership agreement 
interest income and expense interest income declined by million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of ceasing to record interest income from the participants in the management common stock loan program during the quarter ended february  although the participants in the management common stock loan program remain liable for the interest accrued on their loans  we discontinued recording interest income due to uncertainties as to the ultimate collection of these amounts 
interest on participant loans is due and payable on retirement of the loans 
interest expense decreased by million due to reduced debt balances primarily resulting from the payment and termination of our term loan and line of credit agreement  which occurred during fiscal in connection with the sale of premier 
other income and expense during fiscal  we sold two buildings located in the salt lake city  utah area 
as a result of these sales  we recorded net losses totaling million 
during fiscal  we sold a building located in chandler  arizona and recognized a million gain 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and a foreign income tax benefit related to our japan operations 
in fiscal  our benefit was primarily attributable to our ability to net the taxable loss from continuing operations against the taxable gain on the sale of premier 
gain on sale of discontinued operations effective december   we sold premier to school specialty  inc  a company that specializes in providing products and services to students and schools 
premier provided productivity and leadership solutions to the education industry  including student and teacher planners 
the sale price was million in cash  plus the retention of premier s working capital  which was received in the form of a million promissory note from the purchaser 
prior to the sale closing  we received cash distributions from premier s working capital that totaled approximately million 
we recognized a pretax gain of million million after applicable taxes on the sale of premier 
cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on september  the new reporting provisions of sfas no 
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and require those assets to be periodically assessed and written down to fair value  if necessary 
in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
 we hired an independent valuation firm to assess the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with the new measurement requirements prescribed by sfas no 
based upon the results of the valuation  all of the goodwill assigned to the osbu  the cbu  and corporate support group  as well as a portion of the covey trade name intangible asset  were impaired 
the resulting impairment charge from the adoption of sfas no 
totaled million million after applicable tax benefits and was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased compared to the prior year due to the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock as payment for accrued preferred stock dividends during fiscal subsequent to july  the terms of the series a preferred stock agreement require that all future series a preferred stock dividends be paid in cash 
significant business acquitisions and divestitures the following is a summary of our recent business acquisitions and divestitures agilix labs  inc during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased approximately percent of the capital stock subsequentally diluted to approximately percent ownership of agilix labs  inc agilix  a delaware corporation  for cash payments totaling million 
agilix is a development stage enterprise that develops software applications  including software for tablet pcs 
although the software developed by agilix continues to be sold with tablet pcs  uncertainties surrounding agilix s business plan developed during fiscal and their potential adverse effects on agilix s operations and future cash flows were significant 
as a result  we determined that our ability to recover the carrying value of our investment in agilix was remote 
accordingly  we impaired and expensed our remaining investment in agilix  which totaled million  during the quarter ended march  premier agendas during fiscal  we sold premier agendas  a wholly owned subsidiary located in bellingham  washington  and premier school agendas ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary organized in ontario  canada  collectively  premier to school specialty  inc  a company that specializes in providing products and services to students and schools 
the sale price was million in cash plus the retention of premier s working capital  which was received in the form of a million promissory note from the purchaser 
the company received full payment on the promissory note plus accrued interest during june prior to the sale closing  the company also received cash distributions from premier s working capital that totaled approximately million 
for further information regarding the sale of premier  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for fiscal and fiscal the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods

the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
osg sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to properly record shares of company stock held by our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
this correction resulted in a million favorable adjustment to our sg a expense during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended august  quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the timing of large corporate orders  the elimination of unprofitable products or training services  and the closure of retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  line of credit financing  long term borrowings  asset sales  and the issuance of preferred and common stock 
following repayment and termination of our line of credit facility in fiscal  we have not sought to obtain a new credit facility 
consequently  we currently rely primarily upon cash flows from operating activities to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital levels 
at august   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was essentially unchanged from the prior year 
our net working capital current assets less current liabilities was million at august  compared to million at august  the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal cash flows from operating activities during fiscal our net cash provided by operating activities improved to million compared to million in fiscal our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities are payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
although our cash flows from operating activities were unfavorably affected by declining sales  we recognized positive cash flows from operating activities through reduced cash payments for costs and expenses related to generating these revenues  which was reflected by a reduced loss from operations and improved cash flows from operating activities 
while our operating results improved over the prior year  our cash flows from operating activities were unfavorably impacted by required cash payments to decrease our accrued outsourcing contract costs 
during fiscal  we made additional cash payments to reduce our liability to electronic data systems eds for accrued outsourcing contract costs 
in fiscal  we negotiated a revised payment schedule related to our outsourcing contracts with eds for outstanding invoices from december through may these payments were postponed until certain software system implementation issues were resolved 
as part of the revised payment schedule  we made million of additional payments to eds from september through february to bring us current on our liability with eds 
these payments were in addition to required minimum contract costs  as discussed in the contractual obligations section of this liquidity and capital resources discussion  and did not increase our costs of operations during fiscal since the obligations were expensed as they were incurred in fiscal the overall reduction in accrued outsourcing costs  accounts payable  which is seasonally high at august of each year  and other accrued liabilities was million and represented a significant use of cash during fiscal partially offsetting the use of cash to reduce accounts payable  outsourcing costs payable  and accrued liabilities  were reduced inventory levels 
during fiscal  we reduced our net inventories to million at august  compared to million at august  we have actively sought to improve our inventory levels through better management of on hand inventories  especially for electronic devices 
we believe that efforts to optimize working capital balances combined with existing and planned cost cutting initiatives  and sales stabilization efforts  including sales of new products and services  will improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts is dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures during fiscal we used net cash of million for investing activities 
we used million of cash during the fiscal year for purchases of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment at our paper planner manufacturing facility and computer software and hardware 
our use of cash for investing activities was partially offset by the sale of a vacant manufacturing facility  which resulted in net cash proceeds to the company of million 
consistent with prior fiscal years  we reduced capital spending during fiscal in order to focus our capital resources on business critical equipment and projects 
we intend to continue this focus on capital expenditures during future periods 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million 
our primary use of cash for financing activities was the payment of accrued series a preferred stock dividends  which totaled million during fiscal contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  minimum rent payments for retail store and sales office space  cash payments for series a preferred stock dividends  monitoring fees paid to a series a preferred stock investor  and mortgage payments on certain buildings and property 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services    minimum operating lease payments    series a preferred stock dividend payments     monitoring fees paid to a preferred stock investor   debt payments   total expected contractual obligation payments     the company s variable rate debt payments include interest payments at  which was the applicable interest rate at september  in connection with the anticipated sale of our property located in ontario  canada  we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale to retire the variable rate mortgage loan on that building 
other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities on the condition that we can continue to improve our cash flows generated from operating activities  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations beyond that point in time is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources o products we sell planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other technology related products that are primarily sold through our cbu channels 
o training and services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in strategic execution  leadership  productivity  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
these training programs and services are primarily sold through our osbu channels 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and staff accounting bulleting no 
 revenue recognition 
these pronouncements allow the company to recognize revenue after the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sale transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar  delivery of the consulting services  or shipment of the training manuals and related products 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sales arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the sales contract meet the following criteria the delivered training or product has value to the client on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
if the fair value of all undelivered elements exits  but fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total contract consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for the company s existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of the company s software sales have elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently the company does not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of its software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  handheld electronic devices  stationery  training products  and other accessories 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we make judgments regarding future demand requirements and compare these assessments with current and committed inventory levels 
inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the organizational solutions business unit and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars  international licensee royalties  and related products 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
the evaluation of long lived assets requires us to use estimates of future cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our recent history of significant operating losses precludes us from demonstrating that it is more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards will be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
these valuation allowances are based on estimates of future taxable income or losses that may or may not be realized 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of planners and related products  including paper and leather materials 
the company may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers

item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments the company is exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expire on a quarterly basis  are recognized currently and are used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated statements of operations and resulted in net losses of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 
the notional amounts of the company s foreign currency sell contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars japanese yen   australian dollars   mexican pesos  during fiscal  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that were designed to manage foreign currency risks related to our net investment in our directly owned operations located in canada  japan  and the united kingdom 
these three offices comprise the majority of our investment in foreign operations 
these foreign currency forward instruments  which expire on a monthly basis  qualified for hedge accounting and corresponding gains and losses were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal  we recognized losses totaling million on these hedge contracts  which were included in other comprehensive income 
at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 
the notional amounts of our foreign currency sell contracts that qualified for hedge accounting as net investment hedges were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars japanese yen   british pounds   canadian dollars interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in us interest rates primarily as a result of the cash and cash equivalents that we hold 
following payment and termination of our line of credit facility during fiscal  our remaining debt balances consist of one fixed rate long term mortgage and one variable rate mortgage on certain of our buildings and property 
our fixed rate debt has a percent interest rate and requires monthly payments through october our variable rate mortgage has interest at the canadian prime rate percent at august  and requires payments through january we intend to sell the building associated with this variable rate mortgage during fiscal and plan to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale to retire this variable rate obligation 
at august   we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments 
business environment and risk our business environment  economic conditions  and specific risks may affect our future business decisions and financial performance 
the matters discussed below could cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  and stock price 
we have experienced significant declines in sales and corresponding net losses in recent fiscal years and we may not be able to return to profitability since fiscal  we have experienced significant declines in sales 
our sales during fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal although we are taking steps to improve our operating results and have seen significant improvement since fiscal  declining sales have contributed to net losses totaling million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we cannot assure that we will return to profitability 
in addition to declining sales  we have faced numerous challenges that have affected our operating results in recent years 
specifically  we have experienced  and may continue to experience the following o declining traffic in our retail stores and consumer direct channel o declining training and services sales that we believe are partially attributable to general economic conditions that have reduced training budgets at many of our corporate clients o increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories o operating expenses that  as a percentage of sales  have exceeded our desired business model o costs associated with exiting unprofitable retail stores our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions  levels of business activity  and other changes at our clients uncertain economic conditions continue to affect many of our clients businesses and their budgets for training  consulting and related products 
in addition  our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and  consequently  the benefits of any economic recovery may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy 
future deterioration of economic conditions  particularly in the united states  could increase these effects on our business 
we may not be able to compensate for lower sales or unexpected cash outlays with cost reductions significant enough to generate positive net income although we have initiated cost cutting efforts that have included headcount reductions  retail store closures  consolidation of administrative office space  and changes in our advertising and marketing strategy  if we are not able to prevent further revenue declines or achieve our growth objectives  we will need to further reduce our costs 
an unintended consequence of additional cost reductions may be reduced sales 
if we are not able to effectively reduce our costs and expenses commensurate with  or at the same pace as  any further deterioration in our sales  we may not be able to generate positive net income or cash flows from operations 
although we have experienced improved cash flows from operations during fiscal  an inability to continue to increase cash flows from operations may have an adverse impact upon our liquidity and ability to operate the business 
for example  we may not be able to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us 
we are unable to predict the exact amount of cost reductions required for us to generate increased cash flows from operations because we cannot accurately predict the amount of our future sales 
our future sales performance depends  in part  on future economic and market conditions  which are not within our control 
our global operations pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax  and economic risks  which we may not adequately address we have company owned offices in australia  brazil  canada  japan  mexico  and the united kingdom 
we also have licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries 
as a result of these foreign operations and their growing impact upon our results of operations  we are subject to a number of risks  including o restrictions on the movement of cash o burdens of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws o the absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights o political instability o currency exchange rate fluctuations o longer payment cycles o price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies while we are not currently aware of any of the foregoing conditions materially adversely affecting our operations  these conditions  which are outside of our control  could change at any time 
we operate in a highly competitive industry the training and consulting industry is highly competitive with a relatively easy entry 
competitors continually introduce new programs and products that may compete directly with our offerings 
larger and better capitalized competitors may have enhanced abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop and implement training courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our methodologies to new clients 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs our profit margin on training services is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization  or chargeability  of our trainers  client partners  and consultants 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain sufficient pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our training professionals without corresponding cost reductions  our profit margin and overall profitability would suffer 
the rates that we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors  including o our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our programs and products o competition o general economic conditions o introduction of new programs or services by us or our competitors o our ability to accurately estimate  attain  and sustain engagement sales  margins  and cash flows over longer contract periods our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including o seasonal trends  primarily as a result of scheduled training o our ability to forecast demand for our products and services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in our employee base o our ability to manage attrition our profitability is also a function of our ability to control costs and improve our efficiency in the delivery of our products and services 
our cost cutting initiatives  which focus on reducing both fixed and variable costs  may not be sufficient to deal with downward pressure on pricing or utilization rates 
as we introduce new programs and seek to increase the number of our training professionals  we may not be able to manage a significantly larger and more diverse workforce  control our costs  or improve our efficiency 
our new training programs and products may not be widely accepted in the marketplace and may not produce the benefits we expect in an effort to improve our sales performance  we have made significant investments in new training and consulting offerings such as the disciplines of execution additionally  we have invested in our existing programs in order to refresh these programs and keep them relevant in the marketplace 
we expect that these new programs  combined with new product offerings  will contribute to future growth in our revenue 
although we believe that our intellectual property is highly regarded in the marketplace  the demand for these new programs and products is still emerging 
if our clients demand for these new programs and products does not develop as we expect  or if our sales and marketing strategies for these programs are not effective  our financial results could be adversely impacted and we may need to change our business strategy 
if we are unable to attract  retain  and motivate high quality employees  we will not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to grow our business due to our reliance on customer satisfaction  our overall success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire  retain  and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the necessary skills needed to serve clients and grow our business 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious adverse effect on us  including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and thus maintain or increase our sales 
we continue to offer a variable component of compensation  the payment of which is dependent upon our sales performance and profitability 
we adjust our compensation levels and have adopted different methods of compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of employees with the necessary skills to serve our clients and grow our business 
we may also use equity based performance incentives as a component of our executives compensation  which may affect amounts of cash compensation 
variations in any of these areas of compensation may adversely impact our operating performance 
our product sales may continue to decline and result in changes to our profitability in recent years  our product sales have declined 
these product sales  which are primarily delivered through our retail stores  consumer direct channels catalog call center and ecommerce  and government product channels have historically been very profitable for us 
however  due to recent declines  we have reevaluated our product business and have taken steps to restore its profitability 
these initiatives have included retail store closures  transitioning catalog customers to our ecommerce site  outsourcing our government products channel  and increasing our business through wholesale channels 
however  these initiatives may also result in decreased gross margins on our product sales if lower margin wholesale sales continue to increase 
if product sales continue to decline or gross margins decline  our product sales strategies may not be adequate to return our product delivery channels to past profitability levels 
our strategy of outsourcing certain functions and operations may fail to reduce our costs for these services we have an outsourcing contract with electronic data systems eds to provide warehousing  distribution  information systems  and call center operations 
under terms of the outsourcing contract and its addendums  eds operates the company s primary call center  provides warehousing and distribution services  and supports the company s various information systems 
certain components of the outsourcing agreement contain minimum activity levels that we must meet or we will be required to pay penalty charges 
although we negotiated a revised minimum payment schedule for warehouse and call center operations in fiscal  if certain activity levels are not achieved  our sales may not be sufficient to allow us to recognize anticipated benefits from the eds outsourcing agreement in these areas 
our outsourcing contracts with eds contain early termination provisions that we may exercise under certain conditions 
however  in order to exercise the early termination provisions  we would have to pay specified penalties to eds depending upon the circumstances of the contract termination 
we have significant intangible asset balances that may be impaired if cash flows from related activities declines at august  we had million of intangible assets  which were primarily generated from the fiscal merger with the covey leadership center 
these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment based upon cash flows definite lived intangible assets and revenue streams indefinite lived intangible assets 
although our current sales and cash flows are sufficient to support these intangibles  if our sales and corresponding cash flows decline  we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges 
our sales are subject to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends our product sales are subject to changing consumer preferences and difficulties in anticipating or forecasting these changes in may result in adverse consequences to our sales 
although we continue to have a substantial loyal customer base for our many of our existing products  changes in consumer preferences  such as a shift in demand from paper based planners to handheld electronic devices or other technology products may have an adverse impact upon our sales 
while we have experienced stabilizing sales our core products paper based planners  binders  and accessories during the latter half of fiscal  we are still subject to consumer preferences for these products 
our future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price historically  our stock price has experienced significant volatility 
we expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following o fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows o variations between our actual financial results and market expectations o changes in our key balances  such as cash and cash equivalents o currency exchange rate fluctuations o unexpected asset impairment charges o no analyst coverage in addition  the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations over the past several quarters that has had some impact upon our stock and other stock issues in the market 
these factors  as well as general investor concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements and the accounting profession  may have a material adverse effect upon our stock in the future 
we may need additional capital in the future  and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to o develop new services  programs  or products o take advantage of opportunities  including expansion of the business o respond to competitive pressures our recent financial performance has resulted in increased assessments of risk associated with possible financing alternatives 
consequently  we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us 
we are the creditor for a management common stock loan program that may not be fully collectible we are the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
we may be exposed to potential risks relating to internal controls procedures and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors while we believe that we can comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our failure to document  implement  and comply with these requirements may harm our reputation and the market price of our stock could suffer 
we may be exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal controls and have those controls attested to by their independent auditors 
we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow our management to report on  and our independent auditors attest to  our internal controls  as a required part of our annual report on form k beginning with our report for the fiscal year ended august  at present  there is no precedent available with which to measure compliance adequacy 
accordingly  there can be no positive assurance that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors 
in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls  our reputation  financial results  and market price of our stock could suffer
