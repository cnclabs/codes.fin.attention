compounding the problem is the fact that the categories of cassettes and singles are being virtually eliminated by the deliberate efforts of vendors and shifts in consumer preferences

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise inventory and return costs  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  provision for income taxes  and accounting for vendor allowances 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management believes that of the company s significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity merchandise inventory and return costs inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the average cost method 
the average cost method attaches a cost to each sku and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that sku 
inventory valuation requires significant judgment and estimates  including merchandise markdowns  obsolescence and provision for inventory shrink 
inherent in the entertainment software industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records inventory markdowns and obsolescence based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on historical results and trends  and the shrink results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores throughout the year  and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the company is generally entitled to return merchandise purchased from major vendors for credit against other purchases from these vendors 
these vendors often reduce the credit with a merchandise return charge ranging from to of the original merchandise purchase price depending on the type of merchandise being returned 
the company records merchandise return charges in cost of sales 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that the company considers to be important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
when the company determines that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  the company tests for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
the company used a two step impairment assessment to determine if an impairment charge was needed 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit had exceeded its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit would have been considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would not have been necessary 
since the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the company tested goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of the end of and determined that all of its recorded goodwill was impaired 
accordingly a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in loss from operations during the fourth quarter of this impairment charge resulted from operating profits and cash flows being lower than expected during the second half of based on this trend  the earnings forecasts of the company were revised 
given the then existing retail music industry conditions  including cd piracy  management lowered its near term expectations for its business resulting in the impairment charge 
the then current fair values of the company s reporting units were based on the present expectations for these businesses
