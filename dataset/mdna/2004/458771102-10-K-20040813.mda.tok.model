company overview we operate in four reportable operating segments magnetic resonance imaging mri  medical devices  instrumentation  and energy technology 
the mri segment primarily consists of the manufacture and sale of low temperature superconducting lts magnets that are used in mri systems  and radio frequency coils 
these products are used principally in the medical diagnostic imaging market 
until october   this segment also included the manufacture and sale of low temperature superconducting wire by our igc advanced superconductor division igc as 
our newly formed medical devices segment consists of invivo corporation invivo  which we acquired effective january  invivo designs  manufactures and sells patient monitors  primarily for use in mri suites and for centralized nursing monitoring stations 
our instrumentation segment provides cryogenic refrigeration equipment used primarily in ultra high vacuum applications  industrial coatings  analytical instrumentation and semiconductor processing and testing through our wholly owned subsidiary  igc polycold systems inc polycold 
for the first three quarters of fiscal year  this segment also included igc apd cryogenics  inc igc apd 
in energy technology  our wholly owned subsidiary  superpower  inc superpower is developing high temperature superconducting materials and devices designed to enhance the capacity  reliability and quality of electrical power transmission and distribution 
we completed two major divestitures in fiscal year on october   we sold the assets and business of igc as to outokumpu copper products oy 
on february   we sold all of the outstanding shares of our former subsidiary  igc apd  to sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
these dispositions and their impact are discussed in more detail below 
intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for as if the sales or transfers were to third parties  that is  at current market prices 
the company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income loss 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the last sunday during the month of may 
fiscal was a week fiscal year ending may  we also have a foreign sales corporation located in barbados  which remains active until legislation is finalized under the extraterritorial income exclusion act of the act provides for an exclusion from gross income of a percentage of income attributable to certain activities performed outside the united states 
this exclusion is designed to parallel the treatment of foreign sourced income by other countries and contains no requirement for a separate foreign entity to obtain the benefit 
on january   we completed our purchase of invivo  which was acquired through a public tender offer 
invivo designs  manufactures and markets patient monitoring systems 
these monitoring systems measure and display vital signs of patients in medical settings  particularly during magnetic resonance imaging procedures 
as a result of the acquisition  invivo became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of invivo substantially expands our direct sales team and customer base 
invivo s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are included in our discussion on results of operations below 
the total acquisition price for invivo was million including professional fees and other acquisition related costs 
the source of funds for the acquisition was a combination of our available cash and borrowings totaling million under our existing million unsecured credit facility 
on may   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held mri devices corporation mrid and on july   we completed this acquisition 
mrid is a leading manufacturer of rf coils for mri systems 
as a result of the acquisition  mrid became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  a three year million promissory note and  shares of company common stock 
the number of shares paid to mrid s shareholders was based on the twenty day average closing price of intermagnetics common stock prior to the closing  which was approximately per share 
fifty percent of the stock is restricted from sale for two years and the other fifty percent for three years 
the cash portion of the consideration was financed through our million credit facility 
the acquisition of mrid further expands our high value added product portfolio serving the mri market 
in addition  we expect to expand sales of mrid s products through our direct sales force  which is significantly larger than mrid s direct sales force 
on july   our board of directors declared a three for two split on all outstanding shares of our common stock 
the split  to be completed in the form of a fifty percent stock dividend  will be payable on august  to shareholders of record on july  results of operations during the year ended may  sales increased million or to million primarily from the acquisition of invivo 
during the year ended may  sales decreased or million  to million from million for the year ended may  divested businesses represented million of the sales decline 
during fiscal sales of the mri segment decreased million from the prior year or to million 
this decrease is primarily the result of the previously disclosed planned reduction in magnet shipments during the first fiscal quarter related to the transition of managing supply chain logistics for philips medical systems pms in return for an enhanced and extended exclusive supply contract 
in addition  an unfavorable magnet mix combined with lower contractual selling prices more than offset an increase in magnet volume during the remainder of the year 
the increase of rf coils primarily related to increased market penetration of the direct sales market 
during the year ended may  sales of the mri segment increased million or to million 
offsetting this increase was a decrease of million related to the disposed wire business in the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to increased demand  by pms  and other customers for higher field strength magnets  partially offset by a reduced demand for rf coils 
during the fiscal  sales of the mri segment were million 
our newly formed medical devices segment provided million of sales since the acquisition of invivo 
this additional revenue more than offset the decrease from our mri segment 
during fiscal sales of the instrumentation segment increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by continued sales and service growth in our vacuum market in both asia and the united states as well as slowly increasing demand in the semiconductor market during the latter part of the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended may   sales of the instrumentation segment declined million  or  to million 
a decline in sales of million related to the divesture of igc apd was partially offset by an increase in sales of million  related to increased customer demand for the vacuum and imaging products from the pacific rim 
the economic slowdown during this period curtailed demand from most other parts of the world 
during the fiscal  sales of the instrumentation segment were million 
during fiscal year  sales in the energy technology segment increased million to million 
this is a result of increased revenues from billings against existing contracts provided by our industry partners and various state and federal agencies 
during the fiscal year ended may   sales in the energy technology segment declined to million 
this decline was primarily related to reduced third party funding for superconducting projects primarily related to hts devices 
during the fiscal  sales of the energy technology segment were million 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended may   was million  which represents an increase of million or over fiscal as a percent of sales  gross margin increased to compared to during fiscal the increase in both absolute dollars and percent of sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of million of higher margin sales from our medical devices segment 
in our mri segment  gross margin decreased million or to million 
the decline was principally due to unfavorable magnet mix  price reductions and lower sales volumes primarily during the first fiscal quarter as discussed above 
in addition  gross margin from the instrumentation segment increased about million or  primarily from increased sales volumes and manufacturing improvements 
margins from the energy technology segment also increased about million corresponding to the increased revenue under government and third party contracts and the receipt of about million of funding for costs incurred in the prior year 
during the year ended may  gross margin decreased million or to million 
included in this decline was million related to divested businesses 
partially offsetting this was an increase of approximately million related to improved magnet mix and nearly  related to increased customer demand from the vacuum products market 
this was partially offset by decreased sales  and related gross profit of rf coils and customer funding of research and development projects 
additionally  active cost reduction programs contributed favorably to the gross profit during the fiscal year 
gross margin in fiscal was million 
product research and development increased  or to million during fiscal this increase primarily resulted from increased spending on various high temperature superconducting hts projects of about million in our energy technology segment  partially offset by a decline in spending in our instrumentation segment of  as resources were reallocated to existing product enhancements 
in the mri segment  spending decreased million as third party funding increased for continued development on magnet systems  partially offset by new product development costs at igc medical advances 
our medical devices segment contributed million towards new product development 
it is important to note our development activities in all segments increased through third party funding 
during fiscal research and development decreased million or to million 
included in this decline was million of research and development incurred in the prior year related to divested businesses 
the remaining decline of  was related primarily to decreased spending  as development programs mostly in the mri segment began the transition into manufacturing 
most other segments were flat compared to fiscal during fiscal product research and development was million 
during the fiscal year ended may   selling  general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation increased million or to million from fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of invivo s selling  general and administrative expenses of about million as well as the due diligence and integration related expenses associated with the acquisition which totaled about million 
in addition  salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and other employee related expenses increased about million primarily in the mri segment 
this increase is a result of filling open positions as well as creating new positions that correspond with our expected future growth 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense declined million or nearly to million 
included in this decline was million related to divested businesses 
the most significant decline came from the mri segment million related to reduced spending for salaries and benefits  consulting and employment related expenses 
instrumentation segment spending declined about  which relate to costs included in fiscal year for relocating to petaluma  california 
finally  the energy technology segment declined about  due to lower market research and business development costs in fiscal during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets increased million or from fiscal primarily due to the addition of the amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of invivo 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets declined  primarily due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets was about million 
see note n of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income during fiscal decreased  or to million from fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of reduced magnet sales in our mri segment during the first quarter 
additionally  we incurred about million of internal acquisition and integration related costs associated with the acquisition of invivo 
partially offsetting the mri segment decrease of million was the million of operating income contributed by our medical devices segment 
additionally  a decrease in our net investment in the energy technology segment of about  and continued sales growth and related margin in our instrumentation segment resulted in an increase of operating income of million 
excluding the internal acquisition and integration charges  operating income for the fiscal year ended may  would have been million which represents an increase of  or over fiscal year see the reconciliation below reconciliation of financial statements to gaap equivalent fiscal year ended may  may  as reported operating income   internal acquisition and integration charges included in selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income  excluding internal acquisition and integration charges   the company believes this table provides helpful information for assessing the impact of the acquisition of invivo 
during fiscal year  despite reduced sales  operating income improved to million or from million in fiscal essentially this was achieved by controlling non essential costs and aggressive implementation of product cost reduction strategies 
divested businesses had little effect on operating income 
interest and other income during fiscal decreased about  or from fiscal to  this decrease is primarily driven by the continued decline in the interest rate environment as well as our lower cash balances resulting from funding our acquisition of invivo 
during fiscal interest and other income decreased nearly  or to million from nearly million in the previous year 
this decrease was primarily related to the prior year containing  of income from the sale of a product line 
during fiscal  interest and other income was million 
interest and other expense during fiscal increased  to million 
this increase is primarily driven by the interest expense from the million of proceeds borrowed under our million unsecured credit facility used to partially finance our acquisition of invivo 
as of may   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
interest expense during fiscal decreased  or to nearly  this decrease was related to the divesture of igc apd and its associated mortgage 
during fiscal interest expense was  on october   we divested our low temperature superconducting lts materials business  igc advanced superconductors of waterbury  connecticut  for more than million 
the purchase price consisted of a million note  paid in october and the balance in cash 
the agreement between intermagnetics and outokumpu copper products oy  a subsidiary of the outokumpu group of finland  also included a six year strategic supply arrangement that expanded outokumpu s existing superconducting materials business 
intermagnetics will purchase from outokumpu a substantial portion of its internal lts wire requirements  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems for magnetic resonance imaging systems 
the sale resulted in a one time pre tax gain of approximately million in fiscal additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
on february   the company sold the stock of its subsidiaries igc apd cryogenics  inc and ig europe  ltd 
the sale was subject to a stock purchase agreement between the company and sumitomo heavy industries shi of japan dated january  the sale to shi included only the helium related assets of these subsidiaries and the assumption of related liabilities 
the purchase consideration was arrived at by arms length negotiation and consisted of million in cash paid on february  the company was also able to withdraw an additional million in cash prior to closing 
the net pretax gain from the sale was  the agreement included a six year strategic supply agreement under which the company will purchase from shi shield coolers it requires internally  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems 
the mixed gas portion of the refrigeration systems business  previously conducted at igc apd  was transferred and integrated into polycold 
additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
in connection with these divestitures the company has established a liability for environmental remediation and penalties of approximately million 
as of may  and may  approximately million remains on the company s balance sheet in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
in may  the company sold its  shares of kryotech  inc a privately held corporation for total proceeds and a gross realized gain of  in october  fiscal the company sold its remaining  shares of ultralife batteries  inc for total proceeds of approximately million with a gross realized loss of approximately million 
in connection with the sale a net  unrealized holding loss of  has been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
during fiscal the company evaluated the probability of realizing the value of our investments in ultralife batteries inc and kryotech 
as a result  the company determined these investments were impaired and accordingly wrote down ultralife batteries inc to its then current market value as of november  and kryotech to zero  its then estimated value 
the write down amounted to million and was due to a decline in fair market value of these investments  which  in the opinion of management  was other than temporary 
additionally  during fiscal the company received  as a result of a favorable settlement of trade litigation 
during fiscal  the company s effective income tax rate remained the same as fiscal at 
during fiscal the company had an effective income tax rate of compared to a rate in fiscal the increase in rate was primarily related to the ability to use certain capital losses to partially offset capital gains in fiscal due to divested businesses partially offset by the effect of the extraterritorial income regime 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and capital gains during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income  the character of such income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company had federal taxable income of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the remaining deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
the following unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements have been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations as if the acquisition of invivo had occurred on may  in connection with the acquisition the below includes of acquisition related costs 
the table below includes certain costs that would not have been incurred by either company had the acquisition not occurred fiscal year ended may  may  net sales   net income   earnings per share basic diluted in the following unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements  net income for the fiscal year ended may  has been adjusted by million  net of tax for investment banking  legal  other professional fees  inventory impairment charge and the true up of commissions incurred by invivo and other costs incurred by both companies that would not have been incurred had the acquisition not occurred 
by providing this information the company is not implying acquisitions and the related costs are an infrequent event 
however  the company believes this information will provide the shareholders and potential investors with the appropriate information required for assessing the impact of this acquisition 
fiscal year ended may  may  net sales   net income   earnings per share basic diluted the above pro forma results do not include any anticipated revenue synergies 
looking forward  during fiscal  we expect sales to increase significantly  primarily from the mri and instrumentation segments as well as including a full year of medical devices segment sales 
a portion of this growth is expected to come from sales related to high field t and open magnet systems as well as increased market penetration by igc medical advances and newly acquired mrid for rf coil sales and a continuing improvement of market conditions in the instrumentation segment 
we expect our investment in superpower energy technology segment to remain at about fiscal levels 
sales from the energy technology segment are expected to increase during fiscal we expect to make advances towards the first functional superconducting cable on a commercial grid 
additionally we expect to make further progress towards developing products for external market commercialization 
the company will continue to seek partners with enhancing technology to participate in our projects in order to share both costs and technology  as demonstrated in the cable project 
additionally  in fiscal year  we expect to begin to experience seasonality in our sales resulting from the amended contract with our largest oem customer and by the acquisition of invivo and mrid  both of which sell their products to end users in addition to the large mri system integrators 
we expect that the first quarter of each year  which includes slower summer months  will be the lightest because of buying patterns of our newly expanded customer base 
the second quarter is expected to be substantially stronger  followed by a somewhat softer third quarter  which includes a number of globally observed holidays 
the fourth quarter is generally expected to be the strongest of the year 
during fiscal  we expect our selling  general and administrative costs to increase reflecting the effect of the addition of the medical devices segment and increased market penetration by mrid for rf coil sales 
internal research and development is expected to increase significantly resulting from the addition of a full year of expense from our medical devices segment as well as decreased customer funding in our mri and energy technology segments 
our products are continuously being developed in all segments 
typically  our customers are actively involved in the definition and development of these products 
additionally  the company has an active cost cutting program in each of its divisions to increase earnings 
these expectations are based on the following assumptions  among others o the market for mri systems continues to grow  o order trends for mri magnets continue to improve  o instrumentation orders are not impacted by any downturn in the economy  o a continuation of the increased demand from the pacific rim for products of the instrumentation segment  o major oem customers continue to purchase rf coils at increasing levels  o customer acceptance of the new products being developed throughout the company  o new products  existing products and upgrades to existing products achieve the level of growth and market acceptance expected  o low cost competitors of our products are unable to gain a substantial share of the market  o third party funding is available for energy technology to continue its research  o partners are available to continue to help offset some of the unfunded costs related to this research  o the company is able to locate and retain qualified people for various positions  o we are able to maintain gross margins through continued production cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies  o the company does not experience any interruption of supply of our critical materials used in all of our segments  o if such a disruption does occur we are able to find alternate sources expeditiously  o we are able to effectively compete with our competitors in the mri  medical devices and instrumentation segments in regards to pricing  product reliability  technical features  performance and service  o we are able to continue to submit and gain approval for products from the fda under the section k of the code premarket notification process rather than the more time consuming and costly premarket approval process  o we are able to continue to operate under fda approval in our manufacturing facilities requiring such approval  and o we are able to effectively integrate current and future acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal year ended may  the company generated million in cash from operations compared to million in fiscal the most significant use came from inventory which increased million compared to last year 
this increase was primarily the result of the planned slow down of magnet shipments in the first quarter of fiscal associated with supply chain management logistics with pms 
in addition  inventory purchases for the last four months of fiscal include invivo 
investing activities required million during fiscal this significant use of cash primarily resulted from our acquisition of invivo effective january  which included the following payments dollars in thousands cash paid outstanding common shares of invivo  at share  outstanding options of invivo share net of exercise price  transaction costs  less cash acquired from invivo  additional investing activities during the current period included plant  property and equipment purchases of million 
these purchases are for equipment used in production as well as internal research and product development 
partially offsetting this use of cash was the collection of the million note receivable which was the final payment from the sale of igc as to outokumpu advanced superconductors  inc in fiscal year  and proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of  investing activities during fiscal consisted of about million of plant  property and equipment purchases partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million 
financing activities for the fiscal year ended may   generated million which primarily comprised million of proceeds received from long term borrowings used to partially finance the acquisition of invivo  combined with million of costs incurred to obtain the debt financing less million of principal payments made during the year 
in addition  proceeds received from exercised options of million were partially offset by million of treasury stock 
this is compared to the million of cash used in the prior year which mainly consisted of million of treasury stock purchases and million of advances to employees under a shareholder approved executive stock purchase plan 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds received from exercised options 
for the twelve months ended may  the company had a cash balance of million  a decrease of about million from the same period last year 
see the consolidated statement of cash flows  located elsewhere in this report  for further details on sources and uses of cash 
our capital and resource commitments at july  consisted of capital equipment commitments of  as of may   our total contractual obligations for the next five fiscal years are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year non cancelable operating lease commitments      purchase commitments  principal payments on long term debt      on december   we entered into a credit facility with a group of commercial lenders under which we could borrow up to million in the aggregate consisting of i up to million in a five year revolving credit facility and ii a million five year term loan facility 
effective may   we amended this credit facility with our existing group of commercial lenders to increase the revolving credit facility by million and effectively increase the aggregate committed amount to a total million 
in conjunction with this increase  the company is obligated to pay an upfront  non refundable commitment fee ranging from 
to 
to each lender based on their pro rata share of the revolver increase 
these fees will be deferred and amortized using the straight line method over the remaining life of the debt 
the proceeds of this increase will be used for the pending acquisition of mri devices corporation including costs associated with the acquisition 
both facilities have maturity dates five years from the effective date of these loans 
proceeds of this facility were used for the acquisition of invivo corporation including direct costs associated with the acquisition and this credit facility and to provide working capital for general corporate requirements of the company 
we incurred costs directly associated with obtaining the initial amount of the credit facility of million which have been recorded as deferred financing costs and are being amortized straight line over the life of the debt 
this facility replaced our previous unsecured million line of credit 
as of may   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
see also note d in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have adequate resources to meet our needs for the short term from our existing cash balances  our expected cash generation in fiscal  and availability under our unsecured million credit facility 
in the longer term  we may need to raise additional funds if we experience substantial increases in sales volume or unusually large research and development or capital expenditure requirements 
additional funds could also be required for pursuing new opportunities in the energy technology segment or in meeting business development opportunities through additional acquisitions 
we would expect to be able to do so through additional lines of credit  public offerings or private placements of securities 
however  in the event funds were not available from these sources  or on acceptable terms  we would expect to manage our growth within the financing available 
inflation has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on in part  the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue and profit on certain long term development contracts based upon actual costs incurred plus earned profit when these costs are less than the milestone value and the milestone has been achieved or milestone value when the actual costs exceed the milestone value 
on other long term development contracts revenue is recognized upon actual costs and earned profit 
both of these types of contracts typically provide engineering services to achieve a specific scientific result relating to superconductivity 
some of these contracts require the company to contribute to the development effort 
the customers for these contracts are both commercial customers and various state and federal government agencies 
when government agencies are providing revenue we do not expect the government to be a significant end user of the resulting products 
therefore  the company does not reduce internal research and development by the funding received 
when it appears probable that estimated costs will exceed available funding  and the company is not successful in securing additional funding  the company records the estimated additional expense before it is incurred 
in certain instances  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 on product that is complete and ready to ship for which our customer has requested a delay in delivery 
in these cases  all the criteria for revenue recognition have been met including  but not limited to the customer has a substantial business purpose  there is a fixed delivery date  title and risk of loss has transferred to our customer  the product is complete and ready for shipment  and the product has been segregated and is not available to be used to fill other orders 
upon notification from our customer the product is shipped to the stated destination 
as of may   may  and may  these systems comprised approximately  and of consolidated annual revenue  respectively 
the company maintains a reserve for inventory that may become damaged in the manufacturing process or technologically obsolete 
if technology advances more rapidly than expected  manufacturing processes improve substantially or the market for our products declines substantially  adjustments to reserves may be required 
goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  plant closures  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company performs a test for goodwill impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the provision for warranty for potential defects with our manufactured products is based on historical experience for the period the product was under warranty during the fiscal year 
in some cases  when historical warranty information is not available the company estimates warranty costs based on spending related to the cost centers responsible for the warranty repair 
the company believes these reserves are adequate based on the evaluation criteria  procedures in place to control the manufacturing process and pre testing of newly developed products to ensure their manufacturability prior to commercial introduction 
if product quality declines  the company may require additional provisions 
the company maintains a provision for potential environmental remediation for businesses disposed of during fiscal these provisions are based upon in part  the advice from environmental engineers that have visited the sites and understand the scope of the project  should a cleanup be required 
these engineers are experienced in such matters and with the appropriate government rulings in similar circumstances 
we have made our provision based on the estimate provided which did not include any range of loss 
therefore  we are unable to identify or estimate any additional loss that is reasonably possible 
the company believes these provisions are adequate based on estimates from environmental engineers 
if unexpected costs related to the environmental issues are incurred additional provisions will be needed 
the company records an investment impairment charge on available for sale securities when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment 
during fiscal year the company sold all remaining shares of ultralife batteries inc during fiscal the company sold kryotech  inc 
securities which were written down to zero during fiscal this write down was in accordance with the belief that the impairment of these securities was other than temporary 
as of may  the company no longer holds any available for sale securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term marketable securities and long term debt  is not material 
the financial instruments of the company that are interest rate dependent are an unsecured line of credit and a mortgage payable 
the company manages interest rates through various methods within contracts 
on its mortgage payable  the company negotiated an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate at 
with respect to its unsecured line of credit  the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under the line which relate to either the london interbank offered rate or prime  whichever is most favorable 
in addition  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial lender that in effect fixes the rate at 
see note d and note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in response to item for more details regarding these instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of changing rates on earnings and cash flow and to lower its borrowing costs 
additionally  the company makes certain estimates about inventory value  collectability of accounts receivable  warranty expense and market acceptance of new product under development 
we use factors such as probability of use  ability of a customer to pay  historical experience of product repair and customer need and or acceptance of new products in making the associated estimates 
these estimates are believed to be reasonable and based on information available at the time the estimate is made 
the company does not believe that its exposure to commodity and foreign exchange risks are material 
we limit our exposure to these risks by denominating contracts  such as our contract with pms  in us dollars
