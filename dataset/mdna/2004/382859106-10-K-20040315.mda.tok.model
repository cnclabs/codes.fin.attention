the following discussion contains forward looking statements  such as statements of expected revenues and expenses that involve risks and uncertainties 
we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and those discussed in this form k  particularly in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under factors that may affect future results 
unless expressly stated or the content otherwise requires  the terms we  our  us  the company and gric refer to gric communications  inc and its subsidiaries as a whole 
overview we provide secure managed broadband and remote access solutions to enterprises and service providers 
our solutions enable enterprises to securely  reliably  and cost effectively extend their corporate networks and applications to all of their mobile and remote workers outside the corporate firewall 
these workers include mobile professionals such as sales professionals  project managers  and engineers  teleworkers including call center agents  telecommuters  and employees in branch offices and retail settings 
we provide comprehensive and integrated managed broadband and global remote access services that include intelligent client software  multiple network access types including broadband  wi fi  and dial up  security capabilities that ensure security policy compliance by remote workers  a real time remote access management console  end to end managed and value added services including managed security services as well as design  deployment  monitoring  and technical support 
our products and services enable enterprises to reduce the cost  complexity and risk of remote office networking  while maximizing the productivity of mobile and remote workers 
prior to january  we primarily provided internet telephony services that were characterized by high revenues that generated low margins 
in january we ceased providing those services to focus on providing internet based mobile office communications services based on our clearinghouse and settlement capabilities to service providers and corporate enterprises globally 
in december  we acquired axcelerant  inc  a privately held provider of broadband internet remote access services and managed security services 
the majority of our revenue comes from providing settlement and clearing house services for our customers 
we provide services over a heterogeneous virtual network known as the gric tierone network 
as of february   the gric tierone network included more than  internet access dialing locations   public wireless fidelity or wifi hotspots and over  public broadband access points in approximately countries 
through the acquisition of axcelerant  we added a virtual broadband cable modem and dsl network that spans the united states and canada 
this network is an aggregation of the networks of more than broadband providers  including virtually all of the leading cable companies  ilecs and clecs in the united states 
by utilizing this network  we are able to provide comprehensive coverage in the united states for enterprises requiring broadband branch office and broadband teleworker solutions 
we created the combined network by forming contractual relationships with over internet service providers  cable companies  dsl companies and telecommunication companies 
these providers  to whom we refer as the gric tierone network members  are able to share their communications networks 
our customers  who are enterprises and service providers  benefit from the resulting network delivering secure mobile internet access cost effectively 
our member providers benefit from the gric tierone network because we manage this shared network and provide settlement services as a clearinghouse 
as a clearinghouse  we have established common technical  service and payment standards to settle charges that our customers incur when their end users access the network facilities of gric tierone network members to conduct internet based communications  such as internet roaming 
we intend to continue developing our service offering to introduce new internet based remote communications services that may be adopted  deployed and managed on a global scale across the gric tierone network 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception as a result of expenses associated with building the gric tierone network and related network infrastructure and developing our software products 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
see factors that may affect future results we have a history of net losses and may incur future losses 
our business model has evolved in the course of our development and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our future prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
see factors that may affect future results we have limited experience in our business  which makes it more difficult for us to execute our business plan and for you to evaluate us 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when made 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  because they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
we enter into agreements to sell our managed broadband and global access solutions  which may include one or more of our services and product offerings 
revenues are recognized when a binding agreement or purchase order from the customer has been received  the services have been delivered  the fee or price was fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable was reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules  which require us to make certain judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenues are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to recognize revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to the revenues earned for services including related installation services and products and maintenance services  as well as the timing of the delivery of such services and products 
in addition  we provide services over a heterogeneous virtual network  which was created by forming contractual relationships with over internet service providers  cable companies  dsl companies and telecommunications companies 
these companies may provide us their services under either a reseller or an agency arrangement 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must make judgments and estimates with regard to the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each provider relationship to determine which portion of our revenues we provide under a reseller arrangement  where we would record gross revenues and cost of revenues  and which portion of our revenues we provide as an agent  where we would record revenues and cost of revenues combined on a net basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes  any of which could cause a material impact on the revenues that we have reported 
our services for remote internet access are generally billed on a per minute basis for usage or at a flat rate per month per user based on negotiated rates for which we recognize revenue in the month the services are provided 
our solutions may also include installation services  the sale of customer premise equipment and managed security services related to our broadband services offerings 
revenue from installation services and the sale of equipment is deferred and recognized ratably over a month period 
we consider these services and products to be an enabler of the related remote access service contracts and we estimate that on average our customer s remote broadband access workers use our services for a period of approximately months 
revenues from managed security services are recognized in the month the service is provided 
to a lesser extent  we also derive a portion of our revenues from licenses of our authentication software  related maintenance and support services  and other optional services related to our remote access solutions which are recognized ratably over the term of service 
these other revenues amounted to five percent or less of total revenues over the last three years 
fees generated from maintenance contracts are recognized over the life of those contracts 
the majority of the maintenance contracts cover periods of one to twelve months 
amounts billed in advance of revenue recognition are recorded to deferred revenue as collected 
we have some customers with minimum commitment arrangements 
we record such revenue in the month that we determine that minimum commitments have not been met 
we recognize certain broadband connectivity revenues generated under agency arrangements on a net basis 
product returns and allowances have not been significant 
from late to early  the majority of our revenues were derived from internet telephony services 
we record estimated allowances against revenues in the same period the revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis of our credit memo data and other known factors for pricing and transaction volume disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
to date  allowances pertaining to our current business have not been significant 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect amounts associated with future disputes  our actual revenues could be higher or lower than what we have recognized 
from time to time our customers  including significant customers  may seek protection under bankruptcy laws 
while we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an on going basis  when such a bankruptcy event occurs  our management determines our risk that an account receivable will prove to be uncollectable  and establishes appropriate reserves for that contingency as necessary 
in addition  for each continuing customer in bankruptcy management evaluates the creditworthiness of the customer and determines whether revenue should be recognized on an accrual basis or when cash payments are received 
when we record revenue on an accrual basis  management has based their judgment on the creditworthiness of the debtor in possession  their payment experience and whether the collectability of receivables is reasonably assured  in addition to other revenue recognition criteria having been met 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our customers inability to make payments they owe us 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and to impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances might be required in future periods 
if our estimates prove too low  our bad debt expense will increase 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
determination of impairment of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
this analysis is based on our estimate of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate and their eventual disposition 
if we determine that any of these assets have been impaired  the impairment charge will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
as part of our review of our property and equipment during the three months ended june   certain matters were identified related to prior financial reporting periods that required the recording of a net reduction in operating expenses 
we quantified the amounts associated with certain property and equipment for which excess depreciation charges had been recorded against certain property and equipment in prior periods 
accordingly  during the three months ended june  and the year ended december   we recorded a net reduction to operating expenses of  resulting from reduced accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense of approximately  partially offset by an impairment charge to property and equipment of approximately  that was applied against the restructuring benefit 
these amounts are not material to the periods in which they should have been recorded and the adjustment is not material to our consolidated operating results for the year ending december  valuation of goodwill 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition and loss of key personnel 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of our future performance 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value  reflect our best estimates 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
in january and june  we undertook plans to restructure our operations in order to reduce operating expenses 
estimated restructuring expenses have included severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance and timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
our restructuring expenses involved significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which were based upon information provided by third parties 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combination on december   we completed our acquisition of axcelerant  a privately held provider of broadband internet remote access services and managed security services 
our acquisition of axcelerant did not result in a new reportable segment 
the results of operations of axcelerant have been included in our financial statements subsequent to the date of the acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to overview of in  our primary goal was to broaden our business from being based principally on an indirect sales model  selling our services on a wholesale basis through large telecommunications companies and service providers to a model where we sell a significant portion of our services to enterprise customers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of our quarterly revenues was derived from services sold directly or indirectly through vars to enterprise customers 
our rapid global expansion of the gric tierone network demonstrates our commitment to enterprise customers by enabling accountability  reducing cost and complexity and improving visibility of their remote workers globally regardless of the method they use to connect to the corporate network from a location outside the firewall 
in we added  internet access dialing locations   public wireless fidelity or wifi hotspots and public broadband access points to the gric tierone network worldwide foot print 
in addition  as a result of our december acquisition of axcelerant  which had been a provider of managed broadband services focused on branch office and remote connectivity for enterprise customers  we added a virtual broadband cable modem and dsl network that spans the united states and canada 
this network  which is an aggregation of the networks of more than broadband providers who had entered into broadband access contracts with axcelerant  enables us to provide enterprise branch offices and teleworkers with comprehensive broadband coverage in north america 
in order to accomplish our shifting focus to enterprise customers we increased our sales and marketing expenditures during in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of revenues 
while our revenues were not significantly impacted by our acquisition of axcelerant  acquisition costs of approximately million were capitalized as part of the purchase price and either paid or accrued during in  both our annual revenues and annual gross margin increased over cost of revenues declined as a percentage of revenues principally as a result of sales to enterprise customers representing a higher percentage of our total revenues during our network and operations expenses were modestly lower in than in  although we expect our network and operations expense levels to increase both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of revenues in we continue to focus on delivering innovative services for our customers to drive revenue and achieve positive earnings 
in fiscal we plan to release a number of new value added services  which we expect will expand the revenues we derive from our existing customers and  together with expanding the global footprint of the gric tierone network  will drive revenues from new enterprise customers 
achieving sustained profitability will depend on several factors  including the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts both directly and through var sales  the timely release of new services and the introduction of new services by existing or new competitors 
for a discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section titled factors that may affect future results 
revenues revenues for the three years ended december  were as follows in millions revenues total revenues increased million in  representing an increase of 
of this increase  approximately million represents increased usage of our remote internet access services by our existing customers and approximately million represents revenues from new customers

worldcom uunet continues to generate business for us and  although they have not yet emerged from bankruptcy  we continue to recognize revenues from this customer on an accrual basis based on our revenue recognition criteria 
to date all amounts owed by worldcom uunet to us for services rendered subsequent to its chapter filing have been paid in accordance with the terms of our agreement with worldcom uunet 
internet telephony revenues of  were recorded during and no internet telephony revenues were recorded during we expect revenues to exceed revenues based on both selling our services to new customers as well as selling additional services such as our managed security service offering to our existing customers  which we expect to be partially offset by competitive pricing pressures on our internet access services 
costs and expenses costs and expenses for the three years ended december  were as follows dollars in millions cost of revenues percentage of net revenues network and operations percentage of net revenues research and development percentage of net revenues sales and marketing percentage of net revenues general and administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of intangibles percentage of net revenues amortization of stock based compensation percentage of net revenues restructuring charge recovery percentage of net revenues cost of revenues

cost of revenues increased million in  which represented an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the corresponding increases in the volume of remote internet access and the expansion of our customer base as well as the cost of providing additional services and products 
we expect that for the cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars as remote internet access revenues and broadband revenues increase  but be similar to as a percentage of revenues

the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of approximately  in depreciation expense related to older assets still in use beyond their estimated lives for accounting purposes including a reduction of depreciation expense of approximately  due to property and equipment adjustments that related to prior periods and reductions in telephone and connectivity expenses of  which were offset by an increase in outside consulting fees of  an increase in co location expenses of  as we expanded our network and an increase of approximately  in compensation related expenses 
we expect the network and operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in as we expand our customer support department to accommodate our shift to supporting enterprise customers and due to the purchase of new equipment to replace equipment that has reached the end of its useful life and to facilitate the integration of axcelerant 
network and operations expenses decreased to million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses that were primarily due to lower staffing levels  the elimination of compensation programs and a reduction of approximately  in depreciation expense related to older assets still in use beyond their estimated lives for accounting purposes 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  allocated facility and management information systems  depreciation costs  outside consultants  facilities costs  administration and other related costs 
research and development expenses decreased approximately  in  representing a decrease of 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense related to older assets still in use beyond their estimated lives for accounting purposes including a reduction of depreciation expense of approximately  due to property and equipment adjustments that related to prior periods  a reduction of approximately  in outside professional services expenses and  in allocated expenses  offset by an increase of approximately  related to increased compensation and recruiting related costs due to adding staff in the united states and india 
we expect research and development expenses to increase moderately in absolute dollars but stay approximately the same as a percentage of revenues in research and development expenses decreased million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease includes reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  approximately  in outside professional services expenses and  in allocated expenses  primarily due to shifting our staffing from our us headquarters to our development center in india where engineering talent is available at more favorable rates

we expect the overall amount of sales and marketing expenses to increase during in absolute dollars but be approximately the same as as a percentage of revenues as we shift our sales strategy from predominantly an indirect sales channel to both indirect and direct sales efforts 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease reflects reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  approximately  in marketing and promotional programs and approximately  in expenses pertaining to the recruitment and development of employees  each of which were principally the result of decreased staffing levels following our january restructuring and continued efforts to reduce the cost of our operations in general and administrative

during  we expect the amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars while we complete the back office automation and integration of axcelerant and update certain other back office processes and procedures to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and related implementing regulations 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in  representing an decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  the write off of approximately million of uncollected internet telephony receivables in and approximately  in outside professional services  all related to reducing the cost of our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase  of approximately  in allocated facility and management information systems 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles includes one month of amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of axcelerant 
the value assigned to axcelerant customer relationships was million  which is amortized on a straight line basis over a five year life at a rate of  per month 
the value assigned to internal use software was  which is amortized on a straight line basis over a one year life at a rate of  per month 
amortization of stock based compensation 
some stock options previously granted through december  were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value for accounting purposes was higher than the stock option exercise price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
additionally  in connection with of the acquisition of axcelerant  we recorded  of additional deferred stock based compensation  which will be amortized over the vesting period of the underlying stock options assumed during the acquisition 
as a result  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in   in and  in we expect to record amortization of deferred compensation expense of approximately  in  related to options assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of axcelerant 
amortization of stock based compensation for the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands network and operations research and development sales and marketing general and administrative as of december   we had an aggregate of  of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
we expect amortization of stock based compensation to end in restructuring charge 
in june  we undertook plans to restructure operations in order to streamline operations and reduce operating expenses and january we decided to cease providing internet telephony settlement services  based on an analysis of the operating expenses required to support these services and the low gross margins associated with them  and on our expectation that continued internet telephony operations would require additional cash infusions to the business 
during  the restructuring accrual was reduced by cash payments of  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of  during which reflects the reversal of restructuring related employee severance costs of  offset by an  non cash asset impairment charge recorded and discharged in for certain leasehold improvements that were abandoned as part of restructuring activities in previous periods 
as of december   there were no remaining accruals from our june strategic restructuring or january restrucuring 
our june restructuring consisted of  related to involuntary employee severance costs   related to the termination of lease and other obligations and  related to the retirement of fixed assets due to a facility closure

as of december   the remaining accruals from our january restructuring amounted to  during  the accrual was offset by cash payments of  and we recorded reversals to our restructuring accrual in the amount of  during the year ended december   we sold internet telephony assets that were previously written off during the restructuring in january for a gain of approximately  these accruals were reversed as a result of final settlements that were less than the amount of previously reserved obligations 
interest income expense and other and taxes interest income and other  net  interest expense and taxes for the three years ended december  were as follows in millions interest income and other  net interest expense provision for income taxes interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  primarily represents interest income on cash balances and on short term investments 
interest income and other  net  decreased  in  representing a decrease of

the expense related to the fair value of warrants issued was immaterial and fully amortized in income taxes the provision for income taxes consists of foreign taxes 
sfas statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our provision for income taxes increased approximately  in as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we also have net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire in years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which carry forward indefinitely 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our provision for income taxes decreased approximately  in as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we had federal and state research and development tax credits  respectively  of approximately  which expire in years through and approximately  which carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an ownership change could occur as a result of future financing activities as well as secondary trading in our securities 
the annual limitation might result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities  cash and cash equivalents 
our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   in addition to our cash and cash equivalents balance of million  we had a short term investment balance of approximately million 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities in of  was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million and higher accounts receivable balances of million from increased revenues offset by increased accounts payable balances due to increased purchasing activity as our business grows and by adjustments from non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million 
we expect the number of days it takes for us to collect our accounts receivable to lengthen from the periods experienced historically  primarily due to the longer payment cycles generally associated with enterprise customers and the increasing percentage of our revenue base represented by such customers 
net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million  lower accruals for compensation and benefits of million principally due to the elimination of our bonus plan and higher accounts receivable balances of  from increased revenues 
the net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by adjustments from depreciation and amortization charges of million 
net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million and  to a lesser extent  the lower accounts payable balances of million and lower deferred revenue of  resulting from our january restructuring event 
the net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by adjustments from the noncash portion of the restructuring charge of million and higher accounts receivable allowances of million  both of which were a result of our january restructuring event  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in of million was primarily the result of investing in short term instruments using the funds received in april from our series a preferred stock funding offset by net cash of approximately million provided from our acquisition of axcelerant 
net cash used in investing activities in of million was primarily the result of investing in short term instruments using the funds received in april from our series a preferred stock funding 
net cash provided by investing activities in of million was primarily the result of proceeds from maturing short term investments to fund net operating activities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the result of proceeds of sales of common stock to our employees  optionholders and warrantholders 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the result of receiving proceeds from the issuance of our series a preferred stock 
net cash used in financing activities in of  was primarily the result of debt payments and the purchase of common stock 
commitments 
we have entered into certain operating leases and purchase commitments 
the future minimum operating lease and purchase commitments were as follows at december  operating leases purchase commitments thereafter we lease all of our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through we have entered into certain purchase commitments from suppliers who provide network access  software and related services that are utilized by us in order to deliver our products and services solution 
during  we expect to increase capital equipment expenditures in absolute dollars while we complete the back office automation and integration of axcelerant and update certain other back office processes and procedures required for us to efficiently run our business 
indemnifications 
from time to time we enter into types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third party claims 
these contracts primarily relate to i divestiture agreements  under which we may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of our assets  ii real estate leases  under which we may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities  and other claims arising from our use of the applicable premises  iii agreements with our officers  directors and employees  under which we may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship  and iv agreements with customers and resellers  under which we may provide customary indemnifications against claims that our products and services infringe certain copyrights  patents or trademarks  or incorporate misappropriated trade secrets 
the terms of such obligations vary 
generally  a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated  except for indemnifications involving infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations  and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheet as december  stock repurchase program 
in september  the board of directors approved a program to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
we purchased  shares for approximately  during we repurchased no additional shares in or we have no plans to repurchase any shares in the near future 
summary of liquidity 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  and cash expected to be generated by operations during the next twelve months  will fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
on april   we sold  shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock  for million  to investors affiliated with h q asia pacific and vertex management 
the net proceeds of the offering  after deducting expenses  were million 
at the closing of the transaction  we also issued to these investors warrants to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock at a purchase price of per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time within five years after the closing 
each share of series a preferred stock is initially convertible into our common stock at any time at the option of the holders on a for basis 
furthermore  the series a preferred stock will convert automatically into common stock upon the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance or the th consecutive trading day that the closing price of our common stock is at least per share 
as of december   warrants had been exercised on a net basis as to  shares of series a preferred stock and simultaneously converted into  shares of our common stock 
in addition  warrants had been exercised on a cash basis as to  shares of series a preferred stock and simultaneously converted into an equal number of shares of common stock  resulting in aggregate proceeds to us of approximately  in addition  as of december   a total of  shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into an equal number of shares of our common stock 
we plan to invest in expanding our mobile office communications services  on a global basis  by continuing to build strategic partnering relationships 
this will require us to maintain market acceptance  and to grow our mobile office communications services offerings in order for us to continue our research and development activities and fund planned operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that our mobile office communications services offerings will maintain market acceptance  growth and operating margins 
if we are unable to attain our revenue and margin goals  significant reductions in spending and the delay or cancellation of planned activities or more substantial restructuring may be necessary to enable us to meet our cash requirements through the next months 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other arrangements  to fund operations and potential acquisitions  if any 
if additional financing is needed  it might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to january   the provisions of fin are required to be adopted at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after march  the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  we have adopted the provisions of fin and as of december   there was no entities identified that would require consolidation 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple elements  which addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements that include multiple products or services 
specifically  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement that contains multiple products or services contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated 
accordingly  the adoption of eitf no 
may impact the timing of revenue recognition as well as allocation between products and services 
eitf no 
is applicable for transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we have adopted the guidance provided by eitf no 
and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or modified after may  and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  we have adopted each of the provisions of sfas and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the period ending december  factors that may affect future results in addition to the information in this annual report on form k  the following should be considered in evaluating gric and our business 
the markets that we serve are highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
we are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide 
currently  we compete directly with ipass and fiberlink communications corporation in the market for internet roaming and related settlement services  and each of ipass and fiberlink has a network that competes with the gric tierone network 
in addition  ipass has greater cash resources than we do and each of ipass and fiberlink has a larger sales force than our own dedicated to enterprise sales 
large communications service providers such as at t  equant and worldcom uunet also have the ability and resources to compete with us in the internet based mobile office communications services market 
in the mobile broadband services market  our primary competitors include megapath  epresence and netifice 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition or larger customer bases  which they may leverage in order to obtain more favorable volume discounts from suppliers 
in addition  these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more favorable payment terms to customers than we can  which could limit our opportunities to obtain new customers or cause us to lose our existing customers 
if we fail in our strategy of focusing our sales efforts on larger companies  our revenue and profitability goals will likely not be achieved 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues was derived from smaller companies in the internet marketplace  but in recent periods we have attempted to focus our sales and marketing efforts on larger corporate and enterprise level customers 
this strategy places new demands on our business  such as the longer sales cycles and higher levels of service and support that larger accounts generally require 
some of our competitors with greater financial resources than ours have focused their sales efforts on selling to large enterprises for a longer period of time with more success than we have enjoyed  which adds to the risk of our strategy 
if we fail in this strategy  or if we have underestimated the costs of this strategy  we will likely miss our revenue and profitability goals 
if we are unable to increase revenues associated with broadband services  our ability to grow our business will be impaired 
until our recent acquisition of axcelerant  we have generated our remote internet access services revenues to date almost exclusively from the sale of services based on dialup access a narrowband technology 
in some countries  including the united states  the use of narrowband as a primary means of remote access is expected to decline over time as broadband access technologies  such as cable modem  dsl and wi fi  become more widely adopted and used 
although we have recently begun to generate revenues from managed broadband access following our acquisition of axcelerant  the future growth of our business may depend in large part upon our ability to expand the broadband elements of our virtual network and generate broadband revenues at a substantially higher level and growth rate 
we may not succeed in this expansion and we may not generate substantial new revenues  which could harm our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our business strategy has shifted over time and remains unproven  so the success of our strategy cannot be assured 
our business strategy has changed over time 
for example  we ceased to be an internet service provider in and abandoned our internet telephony services business in we have pursued our current business remote access  managed security and related mobile office services for a relatively brief period and in markets that are rapidly changing 
following our december acquisition of axcelerant  we have begun to offer managed broadband services to enterprises with branch offices and large teleworker populations 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to make our current business profitable  and there can be no assurance that our recent acquisition of axcelerant will make us more likely to succeed 
since we have no assurance that customers will continue to use our services or that our customer base will expand  we will have little ability to predict revenue growth or operating results 
our customers are generally free to use competing products and services  so we could face significant customer losses  at unpredictable times 
we had two customers in that each accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues sony communication network corporation and fiberlink communications corporation 
this concentraton of revenue among a few customers makes our business more risky  because losing either of these customers could result in a significant revenue shortfall for us 
in addition  large customers have significant negotiating power during contract discussions or in the event of a customer dispute  which may make it more likely that the terms of the customer arrangement or settlement may be more favorable to the customer 
we are in direct competition with fiberlink  which makes it more likely that revenues from fiberlink will decline in the future 
these factors make it difficult to anticipate the level of our future revenues from existing customers 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to expand and diversify the composition of our customer base 
if we are unable to expand our customer base and increase our average revenues per customer  our business success will be less likely 
if we cannot effectively integrate axcelerant s operations with our own operations  we will not realize the potential benefits of our recent merger 
the integration of axcelerant into our company has been and continues to be a time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if this integration effort is not successful  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger 
having completed the merger  we must now operate a single organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
we may encounter the following difficulties  costs and delays involved in fully integrating axcelerant s operations into our operations failure to successfully manage relationships with customers and other important relationships  failure of customers to accept new services or to continue using the products and services of the combined company  potential incompatibility of technologies and systems  and potential difficulties in successfully integrating the employees of gric and axcelerant  managing our growth and managing larger  more geographically dispersed operations  perceived adverse changes in business focus  the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns  and potential incompatibility of business cultures 
we may not succeed in cost effectively automating  integrating and updating critical back office systems and processes  which could limit our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
historically  we have invested in the automation of back office systems and processes in order to enable us to cost effectively grow our traditional mobile office communications business 
the back office systems and process of axcelerant  whose business we acquired in december  were largely manual 
in order to efficiently provision  support and service our customers  we will be required to cost effectively update  automate and  where appropriate  integrate these systems and processes 
we will need to ensure that the combined company s financial reporting  financial controls and documentation processes meet all applicable financial controls certification standards  such as section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we may underestimate the investments required to accomplish this automation  integration  updating and certification 
we may not succeed in this effort  which could impair our ability to scale our operations  limit our growth and lessen the likelihood that we would achieve profitability 
the market price of our common stock has traditionally been highly volatile  and if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of axcelerant or meet the expectations of analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline further 
in the past  the price of our common stock has experienced large swings up and down 
as of march   our common stock is valued less than it was at the time of the closing of our acquistion of axcelerant 
this volatility might occur again in the future 
volatility can arise particularly in response to quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of us or our customers or competitors  and announcements that we or our competitors make regarding new product and service introductions 
the market price of our common stock can also fluctuate in response to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  particularly those that affect the market prices of technology stocks 
in addition  the market price of our common stock is subject to decline if we do not achieve the expected benefits of the axcelerant acquisition as quickly as anticipated or the costs of or operational difficulties arising from the merger are greater than anticipated 
we have incurred significant losses to date and expect to continue to incur losses for some period of time 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain positive cash flow or profits  our stock price will decline 
we have incurred significant losses to date and we expect to continue to incur losses for some period of time 
we incurred operating losses before income taxes of approximately million for  million for and million for as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and incurred a loss of per share for the quarter then ended 
we have experienced negative cash flows in each year since our inception in  and we expect to continue to do so for some time in the future 
in addition  we may also incur significant new costs related to possible acquisitions  the development of new products and services  the integration of new technologies or the update of old technologies 
moreover  we might not be able to increase our operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
to increase profits  we will need to maintain our relationships with existing customers  generate additional revenue growth from our existing customers and obtain new customers  while continuing to control our expenses 
we expect to continue to invest in network and operations  research and development and sales and marketing  and we expect to face pressure to adopt new pricing arrangements  including volume discounts  that may lower our gross margins 
as a result  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on our ability to sustain and achieve substantially higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
if we fail to sustain or achieve profitability  our stock price could decline 
we may require additional capital for our operations  which could have a negative effect on your investment 
if our cash proves to be insufficient to fund our operations  we may need to raise additional funds at some point in the future 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders may experience additional dilution and these new securities may have powers  preferences and rights that are senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot predict whether additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our business operations  promote our brand identity  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures 
any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the telecommunications industry has recently experienced a dramatic decline  which may cause consolidation among network service providers and impair our ability to provide reliable  redundant service coverage and negotiate favorable network access terms 
the telecommunications industry has recently experienced dramatic technological change and increased competition that have led to significant declines in network access pricing 
in addition  the revenues of network service providers have declined as a result of the general economic slowdown 
as a result  network service providers have experienced operating difficulties in the last several years  resulting in poor operating results and a number of these providers declaring bankruptcy 
if these conditions continue  some of these service providers may consolidate or otherwise cease operations  which would reduce the number of network service providers from which we are able to obtain network access 
to the extent this were to occur  while we would still be able to maintain operations and provide enterprise connectivity services with a small number of network service providers  we would potentially not be able to provide sufficient alternative access points in some geographic areas  which could diminish our ability to provide broad  reliable  redundant coverage 
further  our ability to negotiate favorable access rates from network service providers could be impaired  which could increase our network access expenses and harm our operating results 
if we fail to enhance our existing products or if new services  products or features we introduce do not succeed in the marketplace  we will not be able to generate new revenues and we will have increased costs without the expected returns 
our target markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  products that meet changing customer demands 
for example  our growth prospects will be determined  among other things  by our ability to grow our new branch office services offering  which is an offering into a highly competitive market with a large number of incumbents 
we may lack sufficient resources to anticipate technological and market trends  manage long development cycles or develop  introduce and market new products and enhancements 
in addition  we cannot predict whether our products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable 
any strategic acquisitions or investments we engage in could dilute our stockholders and or result in the assumption of additional liabilities  loss of sales and disruption of our business 
we expect that we will consider future acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we may encounter difficulties in identifying and acquiring suitable candidates on reasonable terms 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt that will give rise to interest charges and may impose material restrictions on the manner in which we operate our business  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur large write offs 
any strategic acquisitions or investments that we make in the future will involve many risks  including the following problems combining the acquired operations  technologies  products or personnel  unanticipated costs  diversion of management time and attention from our existing business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with our suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of acquired companies 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future 
we cannot assure you that any strategic investments we may make will meet our financial or other investment objectives 
any failure to do so could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property 
our products rely upon intellectual property rights 
for example  we have been issued united states patent number  dated april  for method and apparatus for authorizing remote internet access  and have other us patents pending 
we cannot assure you that patents will issue from the pending applications or  if any patents are issued  that they will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology adequately 
in addition  we have a number of trademarks and trademark applications and we use copyright and trade secret protection to protect its software and other original works 
because the technology and intellectual property associated with these products are evolving rapidly  current intellectual property rights may not adequately protect us 
in addition  despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of technology is difficult  and we cannot assure you that the steps they have taken will prevent unauthorized use of the technology 
moreover  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in some countries in which we provide  or may anticipate providing  our products 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that limit the value of our intellectual property 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our competitive edge would be reduced or eliminated 
we may become involved in litigation regarding intellectual property rights that could be costly  could cause us to lose significant rights  and divert our management time and attention 
in the future  we or our customers may become a party to litigation to protect our intellectual property or to respond to allegations that we infringe others intellectual property 
we may receive communications from third parties inquiring about their interest in licensing certain of the third party s intellectual property or more generally identifying intellectual property that could be the basis of a future infringement claim 
if a party accuses us of infringing upon its proprietary rights  we would have to defend our company and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to stop or delay selling  incorporating or using products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and redesign the products and services that use that technology 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
terrorist acts or acts of war  including military actions in iraq and other parts of the middle east and the geo political uncertainties in other continents are having an adverse effect on the us economy and could possibly induce or accelerate the advent of a more severe economic recession 
the us government s political  social and economic policies and policy changes as a result of these circumstances could have consequences that we cannot predict  including causing further weaknesses in the economy 
in addition  as a multi national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we will be predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
thus  the long term impact of these events on our business is uncertain 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our customers require a high degree of reliability in the delivery of our services  and if we cannot meet their expectations for any reason  demand for our products and services will suffer 
our success depends on our ability to assure generally error free clearinghouse services  uninterrupted operation of our network and software infrastructure  and a satisfactory experience for our customers end users 
in the past  we have experienced problems due to our inability to detect system malfunctions and due to errors in collecting or processing account usage and settlement data 
due to the high level of performance required for critical communications traffic  any failure to deliver a satisfactory experience to end users  whether or not caused by our own failures  and any failure to provide accurate settlement data in connection with acting as a clearinghouse  could reduce demand for our products and services 
we depend on our reseller customers to market internet based communications services to their end users  so if our reseller customers fail to market their services effectively  our revenues may be reduced 
our business depends in part on the efforts and success of our internet service provider and telecommunications service customers in marketing internet based communications services to their end users 
although we have recently focused more heavily on selling to large enterprise customers  the highest percentage of our revenues is derived from our traditional service provider business 
it is important that we maintain a healthy service provider business while we attempt to grow a more expansive enterprise customer base 
we have little ability to promote our services  or to promote demand for our reseller customers services generally 
the use of the internet as a medium for communications services remains unproven 
if our reseller customers fail to market their internet based communications services effectively  our revenues will be reduced 
similarly  if the market for internet based communications services fails to grow  or expands more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will be lower than expected 
the internet based services we provide are relatively new and have not achieved widespread market acceptance 
network service providers and communication solutions providers may be reluctant to promote or rely upon our services until they gain greater commercial acceptance  which may never occur 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate unpredictably in the future for many reasons beyond our control 
any of these factors could cause our stock price to decline 
the primary factors that affect revenues and operating results  in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  include the following the volume of transaction based revenues  the timing of deployment of services by our customers  competitive pricing pressure  changes in global travel patterns due to past and potential future terrorist activities in the us and the military responses to them in the middle east  southern asia and elsewhere  the mix of services used by our customers end users  difficulty collecting accounts receivable  particularly from customers based outside the us  and regulation  domestically and internationally 
our operating expenses are largely determined based on our expectations about revenues 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  lower than anticipated revenues for any reason could cause substantial operating losses 
if sars re emerges  business travelers could restrict their travel to and from asia  which could harm our revenues 
severe acute respiratory syndrome  which is generally known as sars  is a highly communicable disease that emerged in asia during the first half of concerns about the spread of sars led to quarantines and travel restrictions being imposed on individuals with suspected symptoms in some countries  and some companies restricted or banned nonessential travel to and from certain parts of asia 
if business travel to asia or elsewhere were to decline for a sustained period of time due to the re emergence of sars related issues or other health concerns  the level of demand for our services is also likely to decline which could result in reduced revenues 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified sales personnel  our business might be harmed 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified sales individuals 
competition for these individuals is often intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel it needs 
moreover  even after we hire salespersons  they require extensive training in our combined products and services 
this training typically covers several weeks of formal in class and on the job instruction 
if we are unable to continue to retain our current employees and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from generating revenue and may negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships 
the uncertain economic environment in general could adversely affect our revenue  gross margins and expenses 
our revenue and gross margins depend in part on the overall demand for information technology products and services  particularly in the product and service segments in which we compete 
softening demand for our products and services caused by the ongoing economic downturn has resulted in decreased revenue growth rates  and may in the future result in decreased revenue  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to realize customer receivables 
the global economy has weakened and market conditions continue to be challenging 
as a result  companies are delaying or reducing expenditures  including those for information technology 
in addition  if our customers experience financial difficulties  we could suffer losses associated with the outstanding portion of accounts receivable 
the global economic downturn has contributed to reported declines in our revenue growth during fiscal further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects and stock price 
security concerns may deter the use of the internet for internet based communications  which would reduce demand for our products and services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to widespread adoption of electronic commerce and communications 
the internet is a public network and information is sent over this network from many sources 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of code breaking or other developments could result in compromised security on our network or the networks of others 
security and authentication concerns with respect to the transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as corporate access passwords  and the ability of unauthorized computer users  so called hackers  to penetrate online security systems may reduce the demand for our services 
if any well publicized compromises of confidential information were to occur  it could reduce demand for internet based communications and our products and services 
government regulations and legal uncertainties regarding the internet could harm gric s business 
gric will be subject to local regulations or laws applicable to access to or commerce on the internet  in addition to regulations applicable to businesses generally 
however  the federal communications commission has initiated several proceedings that may change the regulatory and legal framework for the provision of broadband and internet services and current and future federal communications commission rules and regulations  as well as judicial interpretations of these rules and regulations  could negatively affect gric s business 
in addition  international regulatory standards will govern gric s products and services in foreign markets and could impair its ability to develop products and services for international service providers in the future 
gric may not be able to obtain or maintain all of the regulatory approvals that may be required to operate its business 
the inability to obtain these approvals  as well as any delays caused by its compliance and its customers compliance with regulatory requirements or resulting from uncertainty associated with future regulatory decisions  could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders  which would significantly reduce gric s revenue 
recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  will increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of new rules and devote resources to respond to the new requirements 
in particular  we expect to incur additional administrative expense as we implement section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal contols 
the sarbanes oxley act mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in addition  the nasdaq national stock market  on which our common stock is listed  has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which would adversely affect our business 
the current regulatory environment affecting accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
recent actions and public comments from the securities and exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
in addition  the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  or are developing new proposed standards  such as accounting for stock options  some of which would represent a significant change from current industry practices 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of the adoption of any such proposals on our financial statements going forward 
for example  we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price equals or exceeds the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
however  several companies have recently elected to change their accounting policies and begun to record the fair value of stock options as an expense 
although the standards have not been finalized and the timing of a final statement has not been established  the fasb has announced their support for recording expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
if we were to change our accounting policy in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and retroactively restate all prior periods as if we had adopted sfas for all periods presented  then our operating expenses would increase by approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
provisions in our charter documents might deter a company from acquiring us  which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  and this may potentially lower the price of our common stock 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for the election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we have elected to remain subject to the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these factors may discourage takeover attempts 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
although we have foreign operations in europe and asia  to date  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not been significant 
we primarily invoice and settle in us dollars amongst our customers and providers 
we do not participate in any foreign currency hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk occurs when we cannot hold a purchased investment to its maturity 
the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio  when taking into account the reset feature of floating rate municipal bonds  is limited to days 
we intend to have our securities available for sale 
we do not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this result 
we have established policies and business practices regarding our investment portfolio to preserve principal while obtaining reasonable rates of return without significantly increasing risk 
we place investments with high credit quality issuers according to our investment policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all investments are carried at fair market value for and are considered available for sale 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest fluctuation 
therefore  no accompanying table has been provided
