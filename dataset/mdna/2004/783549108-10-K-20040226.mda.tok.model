item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this report on form k 
overview our business is divided into three business segments our fleet management solutions fms business segment provides leasing  commercial rental and programmed maintenance of commercial trucks  tractors and trailers to customers  principally in the us  canada and the us  our supply chain solutions scs business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout north america and in latin america  europe and asia  and our dedicated contract carriage dcc business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution  principally in north america 
we operate in extremely competitive markets 
our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality  price  technology and service offerings 
as an alternative to using our services  customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves  or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors 
over the past three years we have transformed our business  addressing many fundamental business processes throughout the organization 
we have focused intently on addressing our cost structure and balance sheet in order to deliver improved results to our shareholders and also to make ryder more competitive in the marketplace 
in  we continued to realize significant savings from our cost management initiatives and process improvement actions  allowing us to deliver strong results despite higher pension costs and reduced volumes in our us contractual business 
in the future  we will continue identifying cost saving opportunities to enhance our competitive position in a very competitive environment 
during  we targeted several strategic opportunities in our fms business 
in december  we completed the acquisition of a fleet of approximately  vehicles serving over customers in the us in december  we also announced that we had signed a non binding letter of intent to purchase another fleet of nearly  vehicles serving over customers  which we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of these acquisitions do not require us to build new capabilities and enable us to leverage our existing infrastructure to create operating synergies for our fms business segment 
in  we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in fms and other segments of our business 
in addition to our strategic initiatives  a primary issue that affects our business growth is economic conditions in the us and in other regions of the world where we do business 
because of the soft us economy over the past several years  our us contractual business base was down in we are focused on increasing new sales while maintaining the appropriate pricing discipline that provides an attractive return for the service we provide to our customers 
we are encouraged by recent increased levels of activity and interest on the part of our customers to sign new business 
however  because of the time required to have lease equipment manufactured and delivered and to design and implement a new supply chain activity  there is a time lag in our businesses between the date when a contract is signed and when revenue is generated 
therefore  we do not expect to see an impact on revenue from new sales contracts until the middle of items affecting comparability between periods effective july   ryder consolidated three variable interest entities vies in connection with the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the consolidated vies were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities spes and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements 
ryder enters into sale leaseback transactions in the ordinary course of business in order to lower the total cost of funding operations  to diversify funding among different classes of investors and to diversify funding among different types of funding instruments 
sale leaseback transactions have 
table of contents been executed with third party financial institutions  as well as with spes 
in connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed with spes  in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement  we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligate ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities  if any are realized 
therefore  fin required that these entities be consolidated 
as a result of the consolidation of these vies  ryder recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of million on an after tax basis  or per diluted share in the third quarter of the cumulative effect charge represented depreciation and interest expense of the vies that would have been recorded had fin been in effect since lease inception  in excess of rent expense recorded under operating leases 
the charge is expected to reverse in operating earnings over the next three years 
the consolidation of the vies did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings  however  reported depreciation expense  equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the vies 
in addition  both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased due to the add back of depreciation expense on the vies revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on vies debt 
net earnings for and would not have been materially different if this standard had been adopted effective january  effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption of this standard was million on an after tax basis  or per diluted share  consisting primarily of costs associated with the retirement of certain components of revenue earning equipment 
net earnings for and would not have been materially different if this standard had been adopted effective january  effective january   we also adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and discontinued the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
had we applied the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
as of january   net earnings for would have totaled million  or per diluted share  as compared to the reported net earnings for of million  or per diluted share 
sfas no 
also required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that the remaining recorded goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
the impairment test required us to compare the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to our carrying amount  both of which were measured as of january  the residual fair value after this allocation was the implicit fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded a non cash cumulative effect charge of million on a before and after tax basis  or per diluted share  associated with the asian operations of our scs business segment 
under previous requirements  no goodwill impairment would have been recorded on january  
table of contents consolidated results years ended december in thousands earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  per diluted common share net earnings  per diluted common share weighted average shares outstanding diluted results include restructuring and other charges of million after tax  or per diluted common share in and million after tax  or per diluted common share in see note restructuring and other recoveries charges  net in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
results for include a one time reduction in deferred taxes of million  or per diluted common share  as a result of a change in canadian tax law that affected our canadian operations 
results for also include goodwill and intangible amortization of million after tax  or per diluted common share 
net earnings for include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for variable interest entities resulting in an after tax charge of million  or per diluted common share 
net earnings for also include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for costs associated with eventual retirement of long lived assets primarily relating to components of revenue earning equipment resulting in an after tax charge of million  or per diluted common share 
net earnings for include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill resulting in an after tax charge of million  or per diluted common share 
earnings before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased to million in compared with the increase in earnings was due to savings realized from continuing cost management and process improving actions  improved scs operating performance  better fms rental pricing  and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations 
these earnings increases were partially offset by an increase in after tax annual pension expense of nearly million which principally impacted our fms business segment  which employs the majority of the employees that participate in our primary us pension plan 
the earnings growth rate in exceeded the related earnings per share growth rate because the average number of shares outstanding during increased reflecting the impact of stock issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans during the year 
earnings before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased to million in compared with the increase in earnings was due primarily to a significant reduction in restructuring and other charges from million after tax in compared with million after tax in the increase in earnings was also attributable to cost management actions and operational process improvement efforts  improved rental utilization  increased volumes within the automotive sector of scs  lower interest costs and the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives see note summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these earnings increases were partially offset by a one time reduction in deferred taxes of million in as a result of a change in canadian tax law and higher pension costs of million after tax in  compared with see operating results by business segment for further discussion of the operating results for the past three years 
years ended december in thousands revenue fleet management solutions supply chain solutions dedicated contract carriage eliminations total revenue for increased to billion compared with comparisons were impacted by increased fms fuel services revenue as a result of higher average fuel prices 
for all years reported  ryder realized minimal changes in profitability as a result of higher fuel prices as these generally reflect costs that are passed through to our customers 
during  fms was negatively impacted by continued softness in the us economy resulting in reduced full service lease and programmed maintenance demand  as well as the impact of some ancillary business not renewed 
these decreases were partially offset by improved commercial rental revenue due to higher pricing 
scs revenue decreased in compared with as a result of volume reductions combined with the non renewal of certain customer contracts 
revenue comparisons for fms and scs were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and expanded business in canada  latin america and asia 

table of contents revenue decreased to billion in compared with all business segments experienced a revenue decrease in over as a result of the slow economic conditions in the us and in other countries where we operate 
the fms revenue decrease of also reflects the effects of a smaller overall fleet primarily in commercial rental and lower fuel services revenue as a result of lower average fuel prices and volumes 
scs revenue decreased in as a result of volume reductions  especially in the electronics  high tech and telecommunications sector and the non renewal of certain customer contracts 
our fms segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel  maintenance and other ancillary services to our scs and dcc segments 
eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties 
years ended december in thousands operating expense percentage of revenue operating expense increased to billion in compared with the increase was principally a result of increases in fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices in operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs as a result of an older fleet  offset by a reduction in overhead spending from ongoing cost management actions 
operating expense decreased to billion in compared with the decrease was a result of a reduction in fms fuel costs as a result of lower average prices and volumes in  a reduction in overheads due to cost containment actions  including the shut down of certain facilities in  and the cancellation of an information technology outsourcing contract 
years ended december in thousands salaries and employee related costs percentage of revenue salaries and employee related costs decreased to billion in compared with the decrease was a result of headcount reductions  which offset higher pension expense 
average headcount decreased in compared with reflecting the non renewal of certain customer contracts  the impact of cost management actions and reduced volumes across all business segments 
the number of employees at december  decreased to approximately  compared with  at december  pension expense increased nearly million in to million compared with  and principally impacted fms 
the increase in pension expense is primarily attributable to the us pension plan and reflects the adverse effect of negative pension asset returns in  as well as the impact of lower interest rates resulting in a lower discount rate for calculating the present value of pension obligations 
based on actual pension asset returns experienced in and interest rate levels at december   we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to decrease to approximately million in our pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis of all pension plans 
see critical accounting estimates for further discussion on pension accounting estimates 
the anticipated pension expense decrease in would primarily impact fms  which employs the majority of employees that participate in ryder s primary us pension plan 
salaries and employee related costs increased to billion in compared with the increase was due to growth in pension and medical benefit costs  higher salary expense from the in sourcing of certain information technology functions and greater incentive compensation  which was partially offset by decreased salaries and other employee related costs as a result of strategic initiatives that resulted in the termination of over  employees 
see restructuring and other recoveries charges  net for further discussion 

table of contents years ended december in thousands freight under management expense percentage of revenue freight under management fum expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which ryder purchases transportation 
fum expense of million in was unchanged compared with the volume decline experienced in our scs business during was principally attributed to non transportation based activities 
fum expense decreased in compared with due to revenue reductions in our scs business segment as a result of reduced freight volumes in the us and south america and the non renewal of customer contracts 
years ended december in thousands depreciation expense gains on vehicle sales  net equipment rental depreciation expense relates primarily to fms revenue earning equipment 
depreciation expense in increased to million compared with while the overall average fleet size owned and leased declined during  depreciation expense grew because of an increase in the average number of owned compared with leased revenue earning equipment units 
the number of owned units increased because of the consolidation of vies effective july   the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring lease units with owned 
see discussion on fleet management solutions in operating results by business segment for further detail on vehicle counts 
for the six months ended december   depreciation expense attributable to the revenue earning equipment of consolidated vies approximated million 
depreciation expense increased to million in compared with depreciation expense increased due to a greater number of owned compared with leased revenue earning equipment units as well as reduced estimated residual values associated with certain owned tractors 
gains on vehicle sales  net increased to million in compared with the increase in gains on vehicle sales  net was due to a higher number of fms unit sales of owned equipment and improved average pricing on vehicles sold in the tractor class compared with gains on vehicle sales  net increased to million in compared with despite a reduction in the number of vehicles sold  ryder experienced an increase in gains on vehicle sales  net due to a decline in the average book value of units sold 
the decline in the average book value of units sold in reflected an increase in depreciation expense and an increase in the age of vehicles sold 
we periodically review and adjust residual values  reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
see critical accounting estimates for further discussion on depreciation and residual value guarantees 
while we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur  resulting in higher depreciation or losses on disposal 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in fms 
equipment rental costs decreased to million in compared with the decrease was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles compared with owned resulting from the consolidation of vies effective july   term extensions and an overall decline in fleet size  which principally impacted equipment under lease 

table of contents for the six months ended december   equipment rental was reduced by approximately million for revenue earning equipment of vies consolidated effective july  equipment rental costs decreased to million in compared with the decrease in equipment rental is due to a decrease in the number of leased vehicles and lower lease rates due to a changing mix of leased units 
equipment rental costs in also reflect decreased lease termination charges as a result of improved market pricing 
years ended december in thousands interest expense percentage of revenue interest expense increased to million in compared with the increase in interest expense reflects the impact of interest expense of approximately million on debt of vies  consolidated effective july  excluding interest expense from consolidated vies  comparisons for were favorably impacted by overall lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions which principally benefited fms 
interest expense decreased to million in compared with the decrease in interest expense reflects lower debt levels due to reduced capital spending  generally lower market interest rates and reduced effective interest rates as a result of hedging transactions entered into during the first quarter of years ended december in thousands miscellaneous income  net miscellaneous income  net increased to million in from million in during  miscellaneous income  net was favorably impacted from a million gain on sale of a facility in our european fms operations 
additionally  miscellaneous income  net improved as a result of better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans and lower losses on the sale of trade receivables related to the decreased use of our revolving receivables financing program 
these positive factors were partially offset by the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain vies 
prior to the consolidation of vies effective july   miscellaneous income  net included fee income related to administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with the vehicle securitization transactions 
as a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts  we no longer recognize a benefit from service fee income 
ryder had miscellaneous income  net of million in compared with miscellaneous income  net of million in the increase in miscellaneous income  net during is primarily attributed to a reduction in losses on the sale of receivables related to the decreased use of ryder s revolving facility for the sale of receivables and losses on the sale of operating property and equipment 
years ended december in thousands restructuring and other recoveries charges  net restructuring and other recoveries charges  net were million in  million in and million in see restructuring and other recoveries charges  net for further discussion 
years ended december in thousands provision for income taxes ryder s effective tax rate was in compared with in and in the higher effective tax rate resulted primarily from increased net non deductible items in  principally the write down of goodwill  included in restructuring and other recoveries charges  partially offset by a permanent reduction in corporate tax rates in canada 
this resulted in a one time reduction in ryder s related deferred taxes of approximately million

the charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling million 
while many of these employees had not been terminated as of december   such actions will be finalized by march  we expect pre tax cost savings of approximately million annually in salaries and employee related costs as a result of these cost management activities 
also during  we reversed severance and employee related costs totaling million that had been recorded in prior restructurings due to refinements in estimates 

table of contents other recoveries during principally include a settlement of a commercial dispute pertaining to prior billings with an information technology vendor and gains on sales of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges 
activity during the fourth quarter of  ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately positions as a result of cost management actions principally in our scs business segment and central support services  which were substantially finalized as of december  the charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling million 
our estimate of pre tax cost savings in salaries and employee related costs as a result of these cost management activities totaled approximately million 
during  we reversed severance and employee related costs totaling million that had been recorded in prior restructuring charges due to refinements in the estimates 
other recoveries during include net gains recoveries on sale of owned facilities identified for closure in prior restructuring charges  the reversal of contract termination costs recognized in resulting from refinements in estimates and the final settlement of insurance reserves attributed to a previously sold business 
activity in late  we communicated to our employees planned strategic initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve the earnings power of our business and streamline our structure 
as part of these initiatives  we reviewed employee functions and staffing levels to eliminate redundant work or otherwise restructure work in a manner that led to a workforce reduction 
the process resulted in terminations of over  employees during  which were substantially finalized as of december  severance and employee related costs of million  net of million in recoveries of prior year charges  in included termination benefits to employees whose jobs were eliminated as part of this review 
during the third quarter of  we initiated the shutdown of systemcare  ryder s shared user home delivery network in the uk the shutdown was initiated as a result of our review of future prospects for the operation in light of historical and anticipated operating losses 
the shutdown was completed after meeting contractual obligations to current customers  which extended to december  the severance and employee related charge included million incurred as part of the systemcare shutdown 
during  we identified facilities in the us and in other countries to be closed in order to improve profitability 
facilities and related costs of million in represent contractual lease obligations for closed facilities 
additionally  during we recorded various other charges which are summarized as follows asset write downs asset write downs of million were recorded during and are described below in  ryder cancelled an information technology project in the fms business segment 
in connection with the cancellation  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the write down of software licenses acquired for the project that could not be resold or redeployed and software development costs and assets related to the project that had no future economic benefit 
in  ryder entered into an information technology services agreement itsa with accenture llp accenture under which we outsourced many of our information technology needs that were previously provided by ryder employees 
under the terms of the itsa  ryder prepaid for a number of services to be provided over the year term of the agreement expiring in under the terms of the agreement  ryder was also obligated to pay certain termination costs to accenture in the event the itsa was terminated by ryder prior to the expiration date 
as part of restructuring initiatives in  we approved and committed ryder to in source services provided by accenture under the itsa 
in december  ryder and accenture entered into a written agreement to transition certain it services previously delivered by accenture under contract to ryder 
under this agreement  ryder agreed to waive any right to reimbursement of approximately million in unamortized prepaid expenses related to the itsa 

table of contents strategic initiatives during also resulted in asset write downs to fair value less cost to sell of approximately million for facilities that were identified for closure and held for sale pursuant to the initiatives 
at such time  ryder had the ability to remove the facilities from operations upon identification of a buyer or receipt of an acceptable bid 
fair value was determined based on appraisals of these properties 
also  as part of the strategic initiatives  we wrote down investments in e commerce assets of million  including specialized property and equipment and software  that were terminated or abandoned during and for which the fair value of such investments was zero 
additionally  during  an investment of million in certain license agreements for supply chain management software was written down 
the write down consisted of the unamortized cost of licenses and related software development costs previously capitalized for which development was abandoned as a result of restructuring initiatives 
since the software licenses would no longer be used in the business nor could the licenses be resold  such licenses were valued at zero 
due to the decision to shut down the aforementioned systemcare operations  we assessed the recoverability of systemcare s long lived assets held for use as described in note summary of significant accounting policies impairment of long lived assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assets of million  consisting primarily of specialized vehicles to be disposed of after the shutdown of systemcare s operations  were considered impaired and written down because estimated fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets 
fair values were determined based on internal valuations of similar assets 
goodwill impairment we also identified certain operating units for which circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of long lived assets  in particular  goodwill  may not be recoverable 
we assessed the recoverability of these long lived assets and determined that the goodwill related to these operating units was not recoverable 
see note summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for ryder s policy on impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment charges in  all of which related to scs operating units  are summarized as follows in thousands systemcare uk home delivery network ryder argentina ryder brazil other total as part of the decision to shut down the aforementioned systemcare operations  goodwill of million was considered impaired and written down during goodwill impairment in ryder argentina was triggered by the significant adverse change in the business climate in argentina in the fourth quarter of that led to a devaluation of the argentine peso  breakdowns in the argentine banking system and repeated turnover in the country s leadership 
these factors  combined with a history of operating losses and anticipated future operating losses  led to goodwill impairment 
goodwill of million was considered impaired and was written down in december during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed goodwill associated with our remaining investment in ryder brazil for impairment 
subsequent to the sale of the contracts and related net assets associated with the disposal of our outbound auto carriage business vehiculos in ryder brazil discussed below  we made a significant effort to restructure the operations of ryder brazil 
however  such restructuring was not sufficient to offset the impact of lost business  the impact of the argentine economic crisis and the marginal historical and anticipated cash flows related to the remaining business 
as a result of this analysis  goodwill of million was considered impaired and was written down in december 
table of contents strategic consulting fees strategic consulting fees of million were incurred during in relation to the aforementioned strategic initiatives 
these consulting fees represented one time costs of engaging consultants to assist with restructuring initiatives in loss on sale of business during march  ryder sold vehiculos in ryder brazil for million and incurred a loss of million on the sale of the business 
contract termination costs in connection with the agreement to in source information technology services provided by accenture  ryder agreed to pay termination fees and certain demobilization costs of approximately million 
also during  we made a decision to terminate a long term marketing arrangement to reduce marketing costs 
insurance reserves sold business during  we recognized million in recoveries from an insurance settlement attributed to a business sold in the insurance recovery represents an adjustment to our indemnification reserve for favorable actuarial developments since the time of the sale 
gain on sale of corporate aircraft as a direct result of the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  we decided to sell our corporate aircraft 
ryder sold the aircraft during the first quarter of and recorded a million gain on the sale

css represents those costs incurred to support all of our business segments  including sales and marketing  human resources  finance  corporate services  information technology  health and safety  legal and communications 
the objective of the nbt measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each of our business segments and  ultimately  to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of css costs

fuel services revenue  which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices  is excluded from our dry revenue computation  as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in fuel services revenue 

table of contents versus fms total revenue increased to billion in compared with revenue in was impacted by increases in fuel services revenue as a result of increased average fuel prices  particularly during the first half of dry revenue revenue excluding fuel totaling billion remained unchanged in compared with in  fms total revenue and dry revenue benefited from favorable exchange rates in canada and the uk full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue remained unchanged in as compared to due to the effects of weak leasing demand in the us  a reduction in fleet size and fewer total miles run by leased vehicles  which resulted in decreased variable billings 
the impact of these negative factors was partially offset by higher revenue in canada and the uk as a result of favorable exchange rates and higher volumes 
we expect full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue to improve in due to new initiatives aimed at generating new sales and improving business retention  expected continued improvement of the us economy and the impact from an acquisition completed at the end of as previously announced  we are also in the process of negotiating the acquisition of a fleet of approximately  vehicles lease and commercial rental which is expected to be closed by the end of the first quarter of commercial rental revenue consisting of pure rental and lease customer revenue increased to million in compared with commercial rental revenue comparisons have steadily improved since the end of and  in fourth quarter of  revenue grew compared with the year earlier period 
commercial rental revenue increased primarily as a result of stronger pricing throughout us rental fleet utilization was and remained unchanged in as compared with in the us  pure rental revenue total rental revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers  which accounts for over half of the us commercial rental business  increased to million as compared with million in due to stronger pricing 
lease customer revenue primarily represents rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers  generally during peak periods in their operations 
in the us  lease customer revenue increased to million in compared with the prior year reflecting the impact of increased rental activity from full service lease customers 
rental statistics presented are for the us fleet  which generates more than of total commercial rental revenue 
we expect commercial rental revenue to continue to improve in based on the modest increases in rental transactions experienced during the second half of  improved pricing discipline and the impact of acquisitions 
other fms revenue  which consists of trailer rentals  other maintenance and repairs services and ancillary revenue to support product lines  decreased to million in compared with other revenue decreased due primarily to the non renewal of a customer contract to provide ancillary fleet services which expired at the end of the first quarter of we expect unfavorable comparisons in other revenue to continue through the end of the first quarter of with prospects of modest improvement for the balance of the year 
fms nbt decreased to million in compared with the decrease was due primarily to higher pension expense of million in as compared with nbt comparisons were also adversely impacted by lower lease revenue and the non renewal of a contract to provide ancillary fleet services 
the impact of these items was partially offset by higher commercial rental pricing  improved asset management performance resulting from lower vehicle counts and carrying costs  reduced operating expenses as a result of our cost management and process improvement actions and the impact of favorable exchange rate fluctuations 
versus fms total revenue decreased to billion in compared with revenue comparisons in were impacted by decreases in fuel services revenue 
fuel services revenue declined to million in compared with  as a result of lower volume and pricing  particularly during the first half of dry revenue revenue excluding fuel decreased to billion in compared with reflecting revenue declines in leasing and commercial rental revenue 

table of contents full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue decreased to billion in compared with the decrease was primarily due to the weak us economy as well as decreases in variable billings  which are generally a function of total miles run by leased vehicles 
all elements of our commercial rental revenue decreased in compared with reflecting slow economic conditions and a planned rental fleet reduction  which offset improved rental utilization and pricing 
us rental fleet utilization improved to in compared with in our us commercial rental fleet size declined in as compared with in the us  pure rental revenue decreased to million in compared with due to the continued softness in the us economy 
in the us  lease customer revenue decreased to million in compared with the prior year 
other transportation services revenue decreased in compared with as a result of the weak us economy 
fms nbt increased to million in compared with the increase was due primarily to improved rental utilization  lower interest expense and operating expense reductions due to cost management and process improvement initiatives 
nbt for also benefited from lower carrying costs on used vehicles held for sale owned and leased because of reduced vehicle counts and  to a lesser extent  improved pricing on tractor sales 
such improvements were partially offset by increased pension expense of million in over our fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment is summarized as follows number of units rounded to the nearest hundred december number of units by type trucks tractors trailers other total by business full service lease commercial rental service and other vehicles total owned  leased total full year average  effective july    units converted from leased to owned status in connection with the consolidation of vies

ryder realizes minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in fum expense 
versus scs total revenue in of billion decreased as compared with operating revenue which excludes fum decreased in compared with us operating revenue declined in compared to as a result of reduced volume levels in some of our customer segments and the non renewal of certain contracts 
the revenue reductions in the us were partially offset by increased volumes 
table of contents and expanded business in canada  latin america and asia  as well as the favorable impact of exchange rates 
international revenue comparisons were also favorably impacted by revenue from an inventory procurement contract which generated million in revenue in in the first quarter of  the terms of this contract were favorably renegotiated to eliminate inventory risk and will require net revenue reporting on a prospective basis 
we expect unfavorable revenue comparisons to continue in light of the non renewal of certain customer contracts  competitive market conditions and volume reductions in some industry sectors 
the scs business segment nbt improved to million in compared with a deficit of million in despite lower operating revenue in  scs improved results were driven by numerous profit improvement actions taken in this business over the past eighteen months  which have reduced overhead costs and improved global operating performance 
scs nbt in was negatively impacted by facility lease termination charges of million and also costs associated with profit margin improvement initiatives 
versus scs total revenue in decreased to billion compared with operating revenue decreased in compared with the declines in revenue for reflect volume reductions in the electronics  high tech and telecommunications and consumer products operating units as a result of the slowdown in the us economy in general and those sectors specifically 
the revenue decline was also impacted by the non renewal of certain customer contracts and the currency devaluation and economic downturn in argentina 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by new and expanded business in the automotive sector in our us and european operations 
scs nbt improved to a deficit of million in from a deficit of million in scs nbt was negatively impacted by facility lease termination charges of million recorded in  reduced revenue and higher overhead spending 
the increased overhead spending was due to increased costs associated with profit improvement initiatives and higher employee benefit costs 
these decreases were partially offset by new and expanded profitable business in the automotive and electronics  high tech and telecommunications operating units  improvement in scs european operations and continued benefits from margin improvement initiatives  including the elimination of certain unprofitable business and the implementation of cost containment controls

central support services css expenses were as follows years ended december in thousands sales and marketing human resources finance corporate services public affairs information technology health and safety other total css allocation of css to business segments unallocated css versus css decreased to million in compared with the decrease in total css expense was due to cost reductions across substantially all functional areas as a result of our continued cost management and process improvement actions  most notably in information technology it 
technology costs were lower in as a result of reduced pricing on purchased it services and the impact of in sourcing certain it services during the first quarter of we have achieved reductions in css costs year over year for twelve consecutive quarters as a result of our continued focus on cost management controls 
this focus not only improves ryder s profitability but also helps improve our competitiveness in the market place 
we expect continued reductions in css spending levels to continue over the near term 
versus css decreased to million in compared with the decrease in total css expense was due primarily to reductions in several elements of css expense as a result of our continued cost management actions 
most notably  technology costs were reduced in resulting from the in sourcing of certain it services combined with decreased development and support costs as a result of the cancellation of an fms it project in these cost reductions were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to improved overall performance 

table of contents financial resources and liquidity cash flows the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities years ended december in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities financing activities investing activities net cash flows from operations a detail of the individual items contributing to the cash flow changes is included in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash provided by operating activities increased to million in compared with due to changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold  improved operating performance and reduced working capital needs 
this increase was partially offset by cash contributions totaling million to our defined benefit pension plans 
the reduced working capital needs related primarily to an increase in accounts payable and lower cash payments for accrued expenses equipment rental obligations 
as a result of adopting fin effective july    vehicles were converted from leased to owned status and produced approximately million of depreciation expense add backs to cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in cash from operating activities to million in compared with was attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs  changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold and improved operating performance 
the lower working capital needs in related primarily to lower levels of business activity as reflected in decreased revenue compared with during  cash of million was used in financing activities  primarily to reduce debt 
cash used in financing activities decreased in compared to due to lower debt payments and increased proceeds from stock option exercises 
debt levels in compared with were also impacted by the conversion of off balance sheet obligations to debt attributed to vies consolidated effective july  principal payments on consolidated vie debt totaled million in the decrease in cash used in financing activities to million in compared with the prior year reflects increased proceeds from stock option exercises and lower debt repayments 
cash used in investing activities grew to million in compared with the increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher capital spending  primarily to refresh our commercial rental fleet 
additionally  investing activities reflect payments of million associated with two fms acquisitions closed during the year 
the increase in cash used in investing activities to million in as compared with reflects proceeds of million from a vehicle securitization in partially offset with a reduction of capital expenditures in we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity 
we refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities excluding changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold  collections on direct finance leases  proceeds from sale of assets  capital expenditures and acquisitions as free cash flow 
although free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations 
our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 

table of contents the following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation years ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities changes in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold collections on direct finance leases sales of property and revenue earning equipment purchases of property and revenue earning equipment acquisitions other  net free cash flow the decrease in free cash flow to million in compared with was due to higher capital spending levels which was partially offset by higher sales proceeds 
the increase in capital spending levels and sales proceeds reflects the impact of higher vehicle replacements to refresh an aging fms commercial rental fleet and payments associated with two fms acquisitions completed during the year 
the increase in free cash flow to million in compared with was primarily attributable to a reduction in overall working capital needs and improved operating performance 
the decrease in working capital was attributable in part to lower levels of business activity in as compared with we expect free cash flow levels to decline in as a result of the increased capital spending requirements discussed below 
our fms operations are capital intensive  characterized by significant investments primarily in vehicles revenue earning equipment 
operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to fms and scs spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment  computer and telecommunications equipment  warehouse facilities and equipment 
the following is a summary of capital expenditures years ended december in thousands revenue earning equipment full service lease commercial rental operating property and equipment total capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of million for both and in assets held under capital leases  resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions 
the increase in capital expenditures to million in compared with was due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements  primarily for the commercial rental fleet 
the decrease in capital expenditures to million in compared with was due primarily to reduced us leasing demand  improved controls over capital expenditures and a reduction in the volume of early replacements of full service leases 
capital expenditure levels have been relatively low each of the last three years as we have focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers  redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet 
as a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales activity  total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately billion in  including vehicle replacements of approximately million and vehicle spending for anticipated incremental growth of approximately million 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing 

table of contents during  ryder completed two acquisitions related to the fms segment 
total consideration paid for these acquisitions was million in approximately million is due to the sellers at december  and will be paid  subject to holdback provisions  in and no acquisitions were completed in or currently  we are in the process of negotiating the acquisition of a fleet of approximately  vehicles which is expected to be closed by the end of the first quarter of we will continue to evaluate selective acquisition opportunities in our fms  scs and dcc business segments in financing and other funding transactions we utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines 
the variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt  asset backed securities  bank term loans  leasing arrangements  bank credit facilities  commercial paper and a sale of receivables program 
debt totaled billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of the increase in debt in reflects the impact of consolidating debt attributed to vies  which was previously reflected as off balance sheet obligations and funding requirements to finance the acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter 
vie related debt at december  totaled million 
in  we issued million of medium term notes and retired million of medium term notes 
our outstanding us commercial paper borrowings used to manage our daily cash position decreased to million at december  compared with million at december  during  we added capital lease obligations of million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment 
ryder s foreign debt was million at december   a decrease of approximately million from december  the percentage of variable rate financing obligations including notional value of swap agreements was at december   compared with at december  we generally target a variable rate exposure of to of total obligations 
total debt was billion at december   a decrease of from december  in  we issued million of medium term notes and retired million of medium term notes 
us commercial paper outstanding at december  decreased to million  compared with million at december  during  we added capital lease obligations of million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment 
ryder s foreign debt was million at december   a decrease of approximately million from december  our debt to equity and related ratios were as follows december  december  to equity to equity dollars in thousands on balance sheet debt pv of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles  pv of contingent rentals under securitizations  total obligations discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease 
present value does not reflect early termination penalties  which ryder would be subject to if it terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates 
discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the securitization trusts 
assumes customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due 

table of contents effective july   ryder consolidated three vies in connection with the adoption of fin as a result  ryder s leverage ratios as of december  have changed to reflect the impact of debt attributed to the vies totaling million that would have previously been disclosed as off balance sheet debt see off balance sheet arrangements discussion for additional information on these transactions 
although total obligations is a non gaap financial measure  we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess ryder s overall leverage position 
debt to equity consists of on balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity 
total obligations to equity represents debt plus the following off balance sheet funding  all divided by total equity receivables sold  and the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles  discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease 
prior to july   total obligations to equity consisted of total obligations  described above  plus the present value of contingent rentals under securitizations assuming customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due  discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the trust  all divided by total equity 
the decrease in total obligations to equity ratio in was driven by reduced funding needs as a result of strong free cash flow levels 
leverage ratios in were also impacted by the reduction of accumulated other comprehensive loss as well as common stock issuances 
these items increased net shareholders equity by approximately million in despite the expected increase in capital expenditures in  we anticipate these ratios to remain flat as a result of planned operating performance improvements 
ryder participates in an agreement  as amended from time to time  to sell with limited recourse  trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis 
this agreement expires in july in june  we reduced the amount available for sale under our trade receivable facility from million to million as a result of a reduction in overall working capital needs 
ryder sells receivables in order to fund operations  particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other means of funding  notably  commercial paper 
ryder is responsible for servicing receivables sold  but has no retained interests 
at december  and  there were no receivables outstanding under the program 
losses on receivable sales and related costs associated with this program were million in  million in and million in and are included in miscellaneous income  net 
estimates of losses under the recourse provision are included in accrued liabilities 
since no receivables were sold at the end of or  no amount of available recourse or recognized recourse obligation existed as of december  and our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short and long term debt ratings 
these ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets 
a downgrade of ryder s debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper and would result in no longer having the ability to sell trade receivables under the agreement described above 
as a result  we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below 
our debt ratings as of december  were as follows short term long term outlook moody s investors service p baa negative december standard poor s ratings services a bbb positive july fitch ratings f bbb stable on january   fitch ratings affirmed ryder s ratings and revised our rating outlook to positive from stable 

table of contents we have established an million global revolving credit facility 
the facility is composed of a million tranche  which matures in may and is renewable annually  and a million tranche  which matures in may the primary purposes of the credit facility are to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
at ryder s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
the credit facility s annual facility fee ranges from to basis points applied to the total facility of million based on ryder s current credit ratings 
at december   million was available under this global credit facility 
of this amount  million was available at a maturity of less than one year 
foreign borrowings of million were outstanding under the facility at december  in order to maintain availability of funding  the global revolving credit facility requires ryder to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  of less than or equal to 
the ratio at december  was 
during  ryder filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to issue up to million of securities  including million of available securities that were carried forward from an existing shelf registration statement 
in october  the universal shelf registration statement became effective and ryder established an million program for the issuance of debt securities 
proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt refinancings and general corporate purposes 
as of december  ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities in millions global revolving credit facility limited to less than one year shelf registration statement trade receivables facility uncommitted basis we believe such facilities  along with other funding sources  will be sufficient to fund operations in off balance sheet arrangements we periodically enter into sale and leaseback agreements in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations  to diversify our funding among different classes of investors eg regional banks  pension plans  insurance companies  etc 
and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments 
these sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be vies 
in general  these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet  as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt 
accordingly  sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense 
we did not enter into any sale leaseback or securitization transactions during the years ended december  and proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction were million in the sale leaseback transaction in was a vehicle securitization transaction in which ryder sold a beneficial interest in certain vehicles subject to leases to a separately rated vehicle lease trust and subsequently entered into a lease with the trust 
the activities of the trust and related debt were originally afforded off balance sheet treatment under existing accounting rules 
this trust was consolidated effective july  with the adoption of fin 
table of contents the following table summarizes our undiscounted on and off balance sheet contractual cash obligations at december  thereafter total in thousands debt capital leases total debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations other long term liabilities  total represent future lease payments associated with vehicles  equipment and properties under operating leases 
amounts are based upon the assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements 
no effect has been given to renewals  cancellations  contingent rentals or future rate changes 
the majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
significant items included in the above table reflect purchase obligations related to information technology services and vehicles 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
represent other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams 
significant items included in the above table reflect worker s compensation obligations  bodily injury and physical damage obligations  derivative contracts  deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations 
the amounts exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by erisa and international regulatory bodies  which are million in our minimum funding requirements after are dependent on several factors 
however  we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next years total million for the us plan and million globally assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged 
we also have payments due under our other post retirement benefit opeb plans 
these plans are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see further discussion in note employee benefit plans in notes to consolidated financial statements 
guarantees in the ordinary course of business  ryder provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease  financing and sales agreements 
certain guarantees and indemnifications  whereby ryder may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party  are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote 
as of december   our maximum exposure under these guarantees was million of which million was recognized as a liability 
see note guarantees in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
pension information as of december   we have an accumulated net pension equity charge of million after tax in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability 
this equity charge was reduced million from the million after tax charge at december   reflecting the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year 
total asset returns for our us qualified pension plan our primary plan were in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates 
while we are not legally required to make a contribution to fund our us pension plan until september  we review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans 

table of contents during  we elected to make a million voluntary contribution to fund our us qualified plan 
for  including our international plans  pension contributions totaled million 
after considering the contributions  the projected present value of estimated contributions for all of our plans that would be required over the next years totals approximately million 
changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during could materially change  positively or negatively  the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
share repurchases in september  ryder s board of directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate  in part  the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
under the program  shares of common stock will be purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since january  as of december   the proceeds generated were million 
the program  which extends through september   limits aggregate share repurchases to no more than million 
share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions using working capital  and are subject to market conditions  legal requirements and other factors 
in  we purchased  shares under the program totaling million 
market risk in the normal course of business  ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
we manage these exposures in several ways  including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
we do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets 
see note financial instruments and risk management in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  at december   we had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of billion  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of million  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we estimate the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at december  totaled million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at december  totaled million 
we estimate a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would have impacted pre tax income by approximately million in both and 
table of contents exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
we also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
we do not generally hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies  the lack of transactions between ryder and foreign subsidiaries and the level of net investment in foreign subsidiaries  the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not considered material 
at december   we had a million cross currency swap outstanding used to hedge our investment in a foreign subsidiary 
exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
as of december   we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
we are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of our current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased 
increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers and have only a minor effect on profitability 
we believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact ryder s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters our operations involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to prevent  detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses  such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on ryder s financial condition or liquidity 
see note environmental matters in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely  can result in a material impact on ryder s financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
we periodically review the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the ryder s audit committee 
the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical 
depreciation and residual value guarantees we periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our fms business segment as described in note summary of significant accounting policies revenue earning equipment  operating property and equipment and depreciation and residual value guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reductions in residual values the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment 
we review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment 
reviews are performed based on vehicle class  generally subcategories of trucks  tractors and trailers by weight and usage 
we consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles  expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles eg  rental fleet  scs and dcc applications 
in our estimates  we also make certain assumptions in establishing residual values with respect to future market price trends and the expected recovery of the existing weak used truck market 
as a result  future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors 
based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in by approximately million 
ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements 
certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the vehicles 
results of the reviews described above for owned vehicles are also applied to vehicles under operating lease 
the amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease 
at december   total liabilities for residual value guarantees of million were included in accrued expenses for those payable in less than one year and in other non current liabilities 
while we believe that the amounts are adequate  changes to management s estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles  the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process 
based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in by approximately million 
pension plans we apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis 
each december  we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions  if warranted 
in determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost  we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels 
discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience 
accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  disclosure of the net amount is presented as an 
table of contents unrecognized gain or loss in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we currently have an unrecognized loss of million  of which a portion will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years beyond will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans 
disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the pension expense is presented in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis of projected pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan  the us pension plan  is presented below 
impact on assumed pension rate change expense discount rate million expected long term rate of return on assets million rate of increase in compensation levels million self insurance reserves we use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims  claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
on an annual basis  third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance reserves for reasonableness 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services  unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process 
while we believe that self insurance reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur 
based on self insurance reserves at december   a adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in by approximately million 
goodwill impairment we assess goodwill for impairment  as described in note summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements  at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance 
to determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist  we are required to assess the fair value of a reporting unit compared to its carrying value 
our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model 
estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist 
these assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance  economic conditions and actions we expect to take 
in addition to these factors  our scs reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors 
in late  a key customer contract of our scs uk reporting unit was not renewed which caused us to assess whether this event resulted in an impairment indicator 
goodwill associated with the scs uk reporting unit totaled million 
in light of the profitability of the customer account relative to the entire reporting unit  we did not consider it more likely than not that this event would result in a reduction of our scs uk reporting unit fair value below its carrying amount 
there can be no assurance that a further deterioration in the economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance of our scs uk reporting unit or any other of our reporting units will not result in a goodwill impairment loss 
at december   goodwill totaled million and represented of our total assets 
income taxes ryder s overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized 
at december   the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the scs business segment was million 
in determining the required level of valuation allowance  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is based on management s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods 
our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain  and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates 

table of contents should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made 
we are subject to audit in numerous jurisdictions in the us and around the world
