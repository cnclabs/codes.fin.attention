although our clients may contract with us for a full range of services  our offerings are more typically separated into the construction  design  and installation or the maintenance and upgrade  of infrastructure 
we  or our predecessors  have been active in the specialty infrastructure services industry for over years 
in  we provided services to more than clients 
our industry is highly fragmented and characterized by small  local companies 
with approximately  employees  we believe  based on our experience  that we are one of a limited number of companies in our industry that is national in scope and multi disciplinary in competency  allowing us to address the full range of our clients infrastructure needs  ranging from basic installation and construction to sophisticated engineering  design and integration

some of our larger clients include bellsouth  comcast communications  directv  florida power light  progress energy  and sprint for which we provide services at agreed prices 
our revenues 
table of contents from contracts with these six clients were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the contracts generally provide for extensions by mutual consent 
although these contracts may legally be terminated by our clients for any or no reason on little notice  they can continue in place for many years 
as an example  we  and our predecessor  church tower  have had a relationship with bellsouth for more than twenty years 
from time to time  we enter into contracts for specific construction projects that are unlikely to be recurring in nature 
for example  in we entered into a contract to build a gas pipeline in coos bay  oregon 
in the past two years  gas pipeline projects like the coos bay  have accounted for less than of our revenues 
we are engaged in litigation related to this project  see item legal proceedings 
we serve clients in the following industries telecommunications

we ceased performing contractual services for customers in brazil in the first quarter of and expect to dispose of these assets in through liquidation of this entity in bankruptcy 
as a result of such liquidation  control of the subsidiary would be transferred to the bankruptcy estate 
in we were engaged in a single project in mexico which was completed shortly after year end 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
broadband 
we assist broadband companies  including cable television and satellite companies  to design  build  install  maintain and upgrade the systems that bring cable television  satellite services  digital services  high speed internet access and telephony to homes in the united states and canada 
the services that we provide cable television and broadband providers include designing cable television systems  building or rebuilding of cable television plants  wiring of multiple dwelling units to allow for broadband service and increased bandwidth  
table of contents installing cable television and satellite connections and residential cable set top boxes  modems and satellite dishes  and maintaining networks for providers of cable television and broadband services 
a representative sample of our broadband clients include adelphia communications corporation  charter communications  inc  cogeco cable  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  cox communications  inc  directv  inc  rogers cable  inc  and time warner  inc in  revenues from our broadband services totaled million  or approximately of our total revenues for the year 
comcast and directv accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues for energy

the services that we provide electric  gas and pipeline companies include drafting  permitting  material procurement  and engineering design services  building electrical substations and switchyards  installing natural gas pipelines and manholes  installing overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems  maintaining and installing electrical and other utilities transmission and distribution networks  and restoring asphalt and concrete surfaces 
a representative sample of our energy clients include dominion resources  inc  florida power and light company  gulf power company  oncor electric delivery company formerly known as txu electric company txu gas company  progress energy  inc  southern co 
georgia power co  and teco energy inc in  our energy services revenues were million  or approximately of our total revenues for the year 
traffic control systems and homeland security 
we help departments of transportation and local municipalities design  build  install  maintain and upgrade traffic control systems  including video 
table of contents surveillance systems and cameras  remote controlled variable message signs  radar detection devices  traffic signal systems and count stations 
as of  and during the year ended  december  we provided traffic control services to states and were qualified to provide these services to states and the federal government 
however  as a result of our inability to file our financial statements on a timely basis the number of states in which we are qualified to do business has been reduced in see risk factors if we are unable to obtain our audited financial statements on a timely basis we could experience a decrease in our revenues from some governmental clients 
we began designing  building  installing and maintaining similar systems in support of federal and state government homeland security projects in we believe homeland security represents a growing market for our services 
our homeland security service offerings include bridge  port  border and airport security and monitoring 
the services that we provide departments of transportation  local municipalities and state and federal governmental agencies include designing traffic control systems  installing the electronic components of central control centers that remotely monitor and control the operation of multiple traffic control devices  installing video cameras  message signs  radar detection devices  traffic signals  and count stations on public roadways  and maintaining and installing traffic control and homeland security systems 
a representative sample of our traffic control clients include florida department of transportation  georgia department of transportation  tennessee department of transportation  texas department of transportation  and virginia department of transportation 
in  traffic control systems and other government services revenues totaled million  or approximately of our total revenues for the year 
backlog at december   we had a backlog in our domestic operations of approximately billion 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services we are to perform under project specific contracts and our estimate of work on existing service agreements 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms 
we expect to complete most of our project specific backlog as of december  during the eighteen months thereafter 
many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
since our backlog is subject to unanticipated adjustments and cancellations it is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings 
we have historically experienced variances in the components of our backlog for various reasons 
the revenues projected from our backlog may not be realized or  if realized  may not result in profits 
sales and marketing we market our services individually and in combination with other companies to provide the most efficient and effective solution to meet our clients demands  which increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines 
through our unified mastec brand and an integrated organizational structure 
table of contents designed to permit rapid deployment of labor  equipment and materials  we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet client needs 
we have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the mastec registered service mark and an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of services solutions  providing services ranging from basic installation to sophisticated engineering  design and integration 
we believe our long standing relationships with our clients and reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business 
our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our service groups in coordination with our corporate marketing organization 
most of our management have many years of experience in the industries they serve  both at the service provider level and in some cases with the clients we serve 
our service group managers market directly to existing and potential clients for new contracts and also market our company to be placed on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects 
our executive management supplements these efforts at the national level 
we also market through our internal and external sales forces and our corporate marketing department 
safety and insurance risk management our business requires the use of equipment and exposure to conditions that can be hazardous 
although we are committed to a policy of operating safely and prudently  we have been and will continue to be subject to claims by employees  clients and third parties for property damage and personal injuries resulting from the performance of our services 
we are committed to ensuring that our team members perform their work safely and we strive to instill safe work habits in all of our team members 
our policies require that team members complete the prescribed training and service program for which they work in addition to those required by applicable law 
we evaluate our team members not only on the basis of the efficiency and quality of their work but also on their safety records and the safety records of the team members they supervise 
we also hold regular training sessions and seminars with our team members devoted to safe work practices 
we have established a company wide safety committee to share best practices and to monitor and improve compliance with safety regulations 
the primary claims we face in our operations are workers compensation  automobile liability and various general liabilities 
we maintain insurance policies with respect to these risks  but these policies are subject to per claim deductibles of million 
we have umbrella coverages up to million per claim and in the aggregate 
we are required to post letters of credit to secure our obligation to reimburse the insurance carrier for amounts that have been or could potentially be advanced by the carrier within the deductible layer 
such letters of credit amounted to million at december  we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
we periodically review the status of such claims and expenses and the extent of the accrued liability 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported on a timely basis and the effectiveness of our safety program 
reliance insurance company  our insurance carrier for certain liabilities through july  was placed into receivership in we have considered the financial condition of reliance in the determination of our unpaid claims  including our estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that would be subject to reimbursement by reliance 
our accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
because of increases in claims primarily workers compensation claims  a weak economy  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation  and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to provide the current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
the increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit 
an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity 
if our actual insurance claims or costs are higher than our estimates  it could reduce our profitability and liquidity 

table of contents on january   we formed a captive insurance subsidiary  jmc insurance company  inc  a south carolina corporation  to write a portion of our own workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverages under deductible reinsurance policies 
jmc insurance company  inc  which is our first formation and management of a captive insurance company  was capitalized with a million letter of credit 
suppliers and materials our clients supply the majority of the raw materials and supplies necessary to carry out our contracted work 
we obtain materials and supplies for our own account from independent third party providers and do not manufacture any significant amount of materials or supplies for resale 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for any materials or supplies that we obtain for our own account 
we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 
we use independent contractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
these independent contractors typically are sole proprietorships or small business entities 
independent contractors typically provide their own employees  vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
our subcontracts typically contain provisions limiting our obligation to pay the subcontractor if our client has not paid us 
these payment limitation provisions may not be available to us in certain cases or jurisdictions 
competition the markets we serve are highly competitive 
the specialty infrastructure services arena is highly fragmented and we normally compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
we also face competition from existing or prospective clients which employ their own personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
the industry is characterized by many small companies whose activities are geographically concentrated 
we are one of a limited number of providers with a nationwide comprehensive services offering 
we compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and dependability 
while we believe our clients consider a number of these factors in choosing a service provider  most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which services provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
the competitive environments in the markets we serve are very similar 
however  each market has specific matters impacting the scope of opportunities  as well as the nature and intensity of future competition among infrastructure providers  in that market 
telecommunications 
our telecommunications customers include regional bell operating companies  commonly referred to as rbocs  and rural telecommunications service providers 
factors impacting the capital improvements and maintenance expenditures of our telecommunications customers include competitive pressures  regulatory oversight  changing technologies  the need for ongoing maintenance  and initiatives to expand and upgrade their systems 
recent capital expenditures by the rbocs have been limited primarily to local network maintenance 
these companies curtailed their capital expenditures in part due to economic conditions and also as a result of what they perceive to be a negative regulatory climate 
the federal communications commission  the regulatory oversight body for the rbocs  has sought to encourage local market competition by forcing the rbocs to contract the use of their facilities to competitors at pre established 
table of contents rates which the rbocs have claimed are below their costs 
the united states supreme court has upheld the authority of the fcc to require rbocs to contract their facilities 
this decision and recent actions by the fcc may require negotiation of improved rates for competitors use of rboc networks beginning in such actions may improve rboc cash flows and funds available for future investment 
however  rbocs may continue to limit their capital spending despite what appears to be a need for them to replace their existing copper wire infrastructure with optical fiber an initiative referred to in the industry as fiber to the home 
rural telephone companies rely on subsidized government loans from rural utility services  a federal government entity  to fund their capital expenditures 
recent capital expenditures by these companies have also been limited  however they appear prepared to proceed with fiber to the home network upgrades as a result of increased funding availability from rural utility services and internal initiatives to offer their customers the latest technologies and reduce the digital divide that has existed to date between rural and urban residents 
broadband 
we design  build and maintain cable television networks and also provide cable television and satellite residential installation services 
in addition to required ongoing maintenance and systems upgrades  the capital expenditures of our broadband clients are determined by competitive pressures  franchise commitments and evolving technologies 
cable television companies have been upgrading their networks over the past few years with fiber  coaxial cable and higher capacity electronics 
by introducing fiber optics to their networks  the cable television companies now have the capability of providing more channels  interactive services  video on demand  voice over internet protocol and high speed internet access 
a large number of fiber coaxial networks are now in place 
we believe the cable television industry will continue to consolidate 
consequently  we expect capital expenditures by cable television companies to significantly decrease in the next few years 
energy 
we design  build and maintain distribution systems  both gas and electrical  for energy providers 
to a lesser extent  we are involved in substation and transmission system construction 
our energy clients capital improvements and maintenance expenditures are driven by demands for increased reliability  safety standards  regulatory requirements and overall economic conditions 
historically  energy utilities have contracted with outside parties for their construction projects but performed their own maintenance 
as competitive pressures continue  many utilities may be forced to outsource a greater percentage of their maintenance work 
the august electrical blackout of portions of the northeast and midwest us highlighted the shortcomings that exist in the present us electrical transmission grid 
legislation has been proposed to establish performance criteria for the grid as well as provide economic incentives for its upgrading in order to prevent major blackouts in the future 
substantial funds are expected to be expended over the next ten years to bring the national transmission grid to a higher level of reliability 
traffic control systems and homeland security 
as federal  state and local governments constitute our customer base in this market  the nature and level of government authorized expenditures determine the scope of opportunities available to us 
in particular  this industry will be greatly affected by the amount of funds the federal government appropriates for highways across the country under proposed reauthorization of the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
this reauthorization would be a six year extension of the tea bill passed in that covered a six year program ending in bills related to the tea have passed both the house of representatives and the senate but in different forms 
it is anticipated that congress will extend the tea bill that passed in for a short period of time pending the negotiation of the final law 
the amount of funding ultimately approved by congress will determine the extent to which individual state departments of transportation can pursue additional traffic control systems projects 

table of contents regulation as an infrastructure provider  we are governed by the state and federal laws which apply to businesses generally  including regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
unlike our clients  many of which are in regulated industries for example  utilities which are regulated by the public service commission or broadband companies which are regulated by franchise agreements with various municipalities  as a service provider to these clients we are not directly regulated by these agencies or boards 
our operations are subject to various laws  including those of state and the united states departments of transportation and the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  building and electrical codes  and permitting and inspection requirements 
we do not have any patents that are material to our business 
we believe we have all licenses and permits material to the conduct of our operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if we fail to comply with any material applicable regulatory requirements  including environmental laws  we could incur significant liabilities 
see risk factors our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december   and we operated in the united states  brazil and canada 
in  we became engaged in a single project in mexico which we completed shortly after december  financial information for our us and foreign operations is as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues united states foreign at december  in thousands long lived assets united states foreign our business  financial condition and results of operation in foreign countries may be adversely impacted by monetary and fiscal policies  currency fluctuations  energy shortages and other political  social and economic developments 
we ceased performing contractual services for customers in brazil in the first quarter of and expect to dispose of these assets in through liquidation of this entity in bankruptcy 
as a result of such liquidation  control of the subsidiary would be transferred to the bankruptcy estate 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately  team members in our north american operations and team members in brazil 
the total number of our team members is down from december  by approximately for north america and  for brazil 
approximately of our team members are represented by labor unions  principally the communication workers of america or the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
recruiting 
our primary hiring sources for our team members include promotion from within  team member referrals  print and internet advertising and direct recruiting 
we attract and retain team members by offering technical training opportunities  bonus opportunities  stock ownership  competitive salaries  and a comprehensive benefits package 
our mastec registered brand and integrated service offering also has created a unified corporate culture that we believe helps attract and retain team members 
team members are exposed to numerous technologies being deployed by our clients which serves as a recruitment tool 
we attract talent from numerous sources including higher learning institutions  colleges  and industry 
training and career development 
we believe that our continuous focus on training and career development helps us to retain our team members 
team members participate in on going educational programs  many of which are internally developed  to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training 
manufacturers of telecommunications equipment also sponsor training programs covering the installation and maintenance of their equipment  which our team members regularly attend 
we also provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization that we believe helps retain our team members

the reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and should not be considered part of this report 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this form k 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry and our clients industries an economic downturn in the industries we serve may result in certain of our clients being unable to pay us on a timely basis  or at all  and lead to a decrease in demand for our services 
we are subject to the credit risks resulting from changes in the business and economic factors affecting our clients 
commencing in the latter part of and throughout  certain segments of the telecommunications and broadband industries suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our clients filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencing financial difficulties 
included in general and administrative expense in  and were provisions for bad debts of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had remaining receivables from 
table of contents clients undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling million  net of million in specific reserves for bad debts  with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered through liens or bonds 
the downturn resulted in reduced capital expenditures for infrastructure projects  even among clients that did not experience financial difficulties 
although our strategy is to increase the percentage of our business derived from large  financially stable telecommunications  broadband and energy companies and governmental entities  these clients may not continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels 
even if they do continue to fund projects  we may not be able to increase our share of their business 
additional bankruptcies or further decreases in our clients capital expenditures could reduce our revenues  cash flows and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
since the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  our inability or failure to adjust to our clients changing needs and demands could impact our ability to compete with others who serve those industries 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from clients in the telecommunications and broadband industries 
the telecommunications and broadband industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and broadband providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
additionally  the telecommunications and broadband industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more clients 
the energy industry has also entered into a phase of consolidation similar to the telecommunications and broadband industries  which could lead to the same uncertainties as in the telecommunications and broadband industries 
our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our industry is highly fragmented and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective clients which employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
historically  there have been relatively few significant barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from agreements under which we charge our clients a fixed price for each specified unit of service that we perform 
historically  price has often been the principal factor in determining whether the services provider is awarded the work on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
in addition  we could be underbid by larger competitors in an effort to procure such business 
we may incur goodwill impairment charges which could harm our future operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed a review of goodwill for impairment which resulted in a charge of approximately million million  net of tax 
the primary factors contributing to the impairment charge were the overall deterioration of the business climate during and the continued depression of the market values of our common stock and the equity securities of other companies that serve our industry 
should these factors or similar factors occur in the future  we may 
table of contents incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill 
current and future accounting charges related to impairment would be reflected on our consolidated financial statements as an operating expense 
we may incur restructuring charges which could harm our operating results 
we continuously review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
in  we implemented a restructuring program under which we eliminated services offerings that no longer fit into our current business strategy  reduced or eliminated services that did not produce adequate revenues or margins  reduced costs of businesses which provided adequate profit contributions but needed margin improvements  and reviewed new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 
as a result of this program  we incurred a pre tax charge of million in we could incur charges in the future as a result of similar reviews 
the charges would be reflected as an operating expense and would reduce our profitability 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
in such cases  these objects may rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
if we are unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could adversely impact our revenues and cash flows 
we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we cannot successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our clients could be damaged which could lead to a reduction of our revenues and cash flows 

table of contents actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition 
we are subject to various actual and potential claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business 
claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs 
when appropriate we establish provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments 
if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few clients  accordingly  a reduction in our clients demand for our services or the loss of clients would likely impair our financial performance 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately and of our revenues from comcast cable communications  inc and directv  inc  respectively 
in addition  our top clients accounted for approximately and of our revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major clients  our revenues could decline if we lose one or more of these clients or if the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us could materially decrease our revenues 
a material decline in our revenues would result in a decline in profitability and a deterioration of our financial condition  cash flow and liquidity 
most of our contracts do not obligate our clients to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us would decrease our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from service agreements 
under our service agreements  we contract to provide clients with services within defined geographic areas 
each service agreement consists of individual services work orders  each performed for a fixed fee under the agreement 
under these contracts  our clients have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the work these clients assign us would result in a decline in profitability and a deterioration of our financial condition  profitability and liquidity 
most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  so our revenues are not guaranteed 
many of our contracts are typically cancelable on short notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
therefore  these contracts do not give us the assurances that long term contracts typically provide 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are open to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenues and a decline in profitability which would result in a deterioration of our financial condition  cash flow and liquidity if our clients cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 

table of contents our results of operations may be subject to the risk that we may not estimate accurately the costs associated with our services which would harm our results of operations 
our revenues are substantially derived from service agreements and other contracts that are  for the most part  fixed price contracts 
the terms of these contracts require us to guarantee the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
our profitability is therefore dependent on our ability to estimate accurately the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and rising costs of materials and labor 
certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates  which could harm our results of operations or financial condition 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits 
many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services 
in addition  many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
therefore  our backlog may not result in actual revenues in any particular period or at all 
in addition  any contracts included in our backlog that generate revenues may not be profitable 
we have historically experienced variances in the components of our backlog related to project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control and may experience such delays or cancellations in the future 
if our backlog fails to materialize  we could experience a reduction in our revenues and a decline in profitability which would result in a deterioration of our financial condition  profitability and liquidity 
we are effectively self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  because those policies are subject to high deductibles  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we periodically review the status of such claims and expenses and the extent of the accrued liability 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not timely reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
reliance insurance company  our insurance carrier for certain liabilities through july  was placed into receivership in we have considered the financial condition of reliance in the determination of our unpaid claims  including our estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that would be subject to reimbursement by reliance 
our accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
because of increases in claims primarily workers compensation claims  a weak economy  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation  and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to provide the current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
the increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit 
an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity 
if our insurance claims or costs are higher than our estimates  it could reduce our profitability 
on january   we formed a captive insurance subsidiary  jmc insurance company  inc  a south carolina corporation  to write a portion of our own workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability coverages under deductible reinsurance policies 
jmc insurance company  inc  which is our first formation and management of a captive insurance company  was capitalized with a million letter of credit 

table of contents we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings 
some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds 
bonding capacity in the infrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain  and bonding companies are denying or restricting coverage to certain contractors 
those companies that have been successful in renewing or obtaining coverage have generally been required to post additional collateral to secure the same amount of bonds 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain clients 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future  we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds which would decrease the liquidity that we would have available for growing our business and other purposes 
we reported net losses for the years ended december   and and expect to report a net loss for the first quarter of should we continue to incur net losses  our credit ratings could continue to decline and our overall level of bonding capacity could be reduced 
in addition to being a seasonal business  our business may also be affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
the budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services clients end december as a result  our clients typically reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to render external services in certain regions of the united states and canada 
as a result  we experience reduced revenues in the first and fourth quarters of each year 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently which could reduce our profitability 
our business is labor intensive  and many of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
at times of low unemployment rates in the united states  it will be more difficult for us to find qualified personnel at low cost in some areas where we operate 
additionally  our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers 
as we offer new services and pursue new client markets  we will need to increase our operations management support personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
labor shortages or increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced profitability  which would negatively impact our cash flows from operations and liquidity 
we account for our projects using percentage of completion and units of delivery  therefore variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
we use the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on our non unit based fixed price contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs  after adjusting estimated total contract costs for the most recent information 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
accordingly  contract revenues and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our cash flow from operations and liquidity 

table of contents we recognize revenue on unit based construction and installation projects using the units of delivery method 
under the units of delivery method revenue is recognized as the units are completed 
the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract 
our profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed our original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on these projects if the estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the project exceed the revenues to be earned on such units 
for the year ended december  we incurred approximately million of losses on percentage of completion contracts 
we expect to record additional losses and charges as a result of our brazil operations 
in the years ended december   and  and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from operations in brazil and in we experienced a net loss of million from these operations 
the largest portion approximately million of this net loss arose from approximately  labor claims brought by ex employees against our brazil operations which are still pending as of june  almost half of those claims resulted from december terminations 
we ceased performing contractual services for customers in brazil in the first quarter of and expect to dispose of these assets in through liquidation of this entity in bankruptcy 
as a result of such liquidation  control of the subsidiary would be transferred to the bankruptcy estate 
we will record additional losses in as a result of our brazil operations including charges relating to the writeoffs of our net investment in  and goodwill recorded for our brazil subsidiary 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions include varying degrees of inherent risk that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
we have made  and may in the future make  strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to integrate the acquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenues are not realized or are delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  and the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
a failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with or resulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity 
borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service the debt within the scheduled repayment terms 
risks related to our company and our common stock failure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our business 
we are in the process of improving our procedures and measures  and in the future plan to continue to work on strengthening these procedures  to enhance the effectiveness of our internal controls 
see item a controls and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we are not successful in complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of on a timely basis  our ability to obtain financing may be impaired 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting beginning with our annual report and also requires our independent public accountants to attest to this report 
we may not be successful in complying with section prior to the due date of our annual report 
the failure to comply with section could result in a reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of clients  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
we may incur significant expenses due to the purported class action complaints that were filed against us and certain of our officers 
in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the complaints allege violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings reports 
we may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
see item legal proceedings 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  fluctuations in our operating revenues 
primarily as a result of the bankruptcies and adverse financial conditions of certain of our telecommunications and broadband clients and declining sales of our telecommunications  broadband and energy services  we experienced a decline in our revenues of million from to we may experience similar declines in revenues in the future 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
from to  for example  our common stock fluctuated from a high of in the first quarter of to a low of in the first quarter of numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock 
such factors include announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  future sales of our common stock or other securities  announcements of new contracts or clients by us or one of our competitors  market conditions for telecommunications  broadband or energy  or telecommunications  broadband or energy services companies stocks in general  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
our credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
we have a million revolving credit facility 
we also have a subordinated debt agreement 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the senior subordinated notes due in 
table of contents february was million 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things making investments in excess of specified amounts  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying cash dividends  making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount  creating certain liens  prepaying our other indebtedness  including the senior subordinated notes  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and senior subordinated notes indenture 
events that are beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with these provisions 
if we breach any of these covenants  we could be in default under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes 
a default could result in the acceleration of either our obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes  or both 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent additional financing is needed  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms which may decrease our liquidity 
if our operating losses continue we may be in default under our credit facility 
we were not in compliance with certain covenants of our credit facility as of december   due to our net loss for and the delay in filing this annual report on form k 
we amended our credit facility on july  based upon our internal projections  we expect to be in compliance with the amended financial covenants of the credit facility 
however  we may not be able to achieve our internal projections or maintain compliance with the amended financial covenants  in which case we could be required to seek further modifications of the terms of our credit facility or another source of financing to continue operations 
if we are unable to obtain our audited financial statements on a timely basis we could experience a decrease in our revenues from some governmental clients 
the audit of our financial statements and the filing of this annual report on form k were not completed within the period necessary for us to qualify as an approved direct bidder for state department of transportation projects in florida and texas 
these states require that we submit on an annual basis  audited financial statements within days after the end of the audited period 
the other state dot s also require us to submit our annual financial information to qualify as an approved direct bidder for their projects 
until we submit such audited financial statements and other information on a timely basis  our status as an approved bidder for any new state dot work in those states has been  or could be  suspended 
as a result  until we are able to comply with the applicable state dot requirements we could be unable to serve as a direct provider of new services to several state dot s and we could experience a decrease in revenues from these clients 

table of contents a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  and other members of his family beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that other shareholders might consider in their best interest 
our articles of incorporation and florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the florida business corporation act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of mastec and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock  including the loss of voting control to others which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of mastec 
item properties our corporate headquarters were previously located in a  square foot building owned by us in miami  florida 
we relocated our corporate headquarters to a  square foot leased facility in coral gables  florida in december in august  we sold our former headquarters building for million 
our operations are conducted from approximately service facilities 
we do not believe any of these facilities is material to our operations because most of our services are performed on the clients premises or on public rights of way 
in addition  we believe that suitable alternative locations are available in substantially all areas where we currently conduct business 
we also own property and equipment  which at december  had a net book value of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this property and equipment includes land  buildings  vans  trucks  tractors  trailers  bucket trucks  backhoes  bulldozers  directional boring machines  digger derricks  cranes and testing equipment 
we obtain our equipment from various third party vendors  none of which we depend upon  and did not experience any difficulties in obtaining desired equipment in however  we have experienced recent credit downgrades as a result of our operating losses and other factors  and in the future we may experience difficulties in obtaining desired equipment 
if we are successful in obtaining such equipment  it may be on terms less favorable than previous purchase or leasing arrangements 
item legal proceedings in the second quarter of  purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and one was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
these cases have been 
table of contents consolidated in the southern district of florida 
the complaints allege certain violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  related to current and prior period earnings reports 
we plan to vigorously defend these lawsuits but we may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurring significant expenses 
due to the early stage of these proceedings any potential loss cannot presently be determined with respect to this litigation 
the united states army corps of engineers together with the oregon division of state land  and department of environmental quality has issued two cease and desist orders with respect to our coos bay gas pipeline project 
the first cease and desist order was issued on october  and addressed sedimentary disturbances and the discharge of bentinite resulting from directional boring under stream beds along a portion of the natural gas pipeline route then under construction 
we received the subsequent cease and desist order on december  the order addressed additional sedimentary discharges caused by the clean up efforts 
we are in substantial disagreement with the united states army corps of engineers and the oregon division of state land as to whether the subject discharges were permitted pursuant to nationwide permit no 
utility line activities or are otherwise prohibited pursuant to the clean water act 
however  we have been cooperating with united states army corps of engineers and the oregon division of state land to mitigate any adverse impact as a result of the construction 
no fines or penalties have been assessed to date 
construction work on the pipeline ceased in december in february  we brought an action for breach of contract against coos county in federal district court in oregon  seeking payment for work done  interest and anticipated profits 
in april  coos county announced it was terminating the contract and seeking another company to complete the project 
coos county subsequently counterclaimed for breach of contract and other causes in the federal district court action 
the amount of revenues we have recognized on the coos bay project that remain uncollected at december  amounted to million 
in addition to these uncollected receivables  we also have other claims and interest in excess of million which we have not recognized as revenue and to which we believe we are entitled to under the terms of the contract 
in addition  we have been made party to a number of citizen initiated actions arising from the coos county project 
a number of individual property owners have brought claims in oregon state courts against us for property damages and related claims  a number of citizens groups have brought an action in federal court for alleged violations of the clean water act

on january   harry schipper  a mastec shareholder  filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the us district court for the southern district of florida against us as nominal defendant and against certain current and former members of the board of directors and senior management  including jorge mas  our chairman of the board  and austin j 
shanfelter  our president and chief executive officer 
the lawsuit alleges mismanagement  misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty as a result of a series of allegedly fraudulent and criminal transactions  including the sintel matter described above  the severance we paid our former chief executive officer  and our investment in and financing of a client that 
table of contents subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection  as well as certain other matters 
the lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief against the individual defendants on mastec s behalf 
the board of directors has formed a special litigation committee  as contemplated by florida law  to investigate the allegations of the complaint and to determine whether it is in the best interests of mastec to pursue the lawsuit 
on july   mr 
schipper made a supplemental demand on our board of directors by letter to investigate allegations that we reported greater revenue in an unspecified amount on certain contracts than permitted under the contract terms and we recognized between to million in income for certain projects on the books of two separate subsidiaries 
these additional allegations were referred to the special committee for investigation

our directors and officers insurance carrier paid million into a settlement fund   of this fund will be paid to plaintiff s counsel to cover fees and expenses and the remaining  will be available to be used at our discretion 
the special litigation committee issued its report on december   as amended on april  the report concluded that the settlement would be in the best interest of mastec and its shareholders  that it was not in our best interest to pursue claims against our officers and directors and  specifically with respect to the improper recognition of revenue allegations in mr 
schipper s supplemental demand the report concluded that there was no evidence that any improper conduct had been involved 
on february   the court entered an order setting a fairness hearing for june  in which the settlement was finalized 
our insurance carrier deposited the million into escrow to be released in july if no appeal of the decision is filed 
we are also a party to other pending legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business
