item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those predicted in these forward looking statements  and the events anticipated in the forward looking statements may not actually occur 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  unless required by law 
revision of financial statements we are revising our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  and for the first three quarters of december  and for each of the quarters in the year ended for the following four items in december  we discovered a non cash clerical error in computing depreciation related to two fixed asset categories during the three year period ended december  as a result of correcting this error  our operating expenses have been decreased by  in and  in in the quarter ended june   we determined that the acquisition of irvine networks  llc now our xiran division previously recorded as a business combination in the quarter ended march   should instead have been recorded as an acquisition of assets 
as such  in our previously issued financial statements for the quarter ended june   we recorded the effect of correcting this accounting entirely in that quarter  rather than by revising our previously issued financial statements 
as a consequence  in the quarter ended june   we previously i reclassified  of the  goodwill that had been recorded at the time of the transaction to amortizable intangible assets  representing assembled workforce with an estimated life of five years  ii charged off against income the remaining  of goodwill  and iii recorded amortization expense of  reflecting the  cumulative effect of related amortization since the date of the acquisition as well as  in amortization for the quarter ended june  after further analysis  we have determined that the appropriate accounting would have been to retroactively reflect the effect of the asset acquisition for all periods since the date of acquisition 
consequently  we have now revised our previously issued financial statements to primarily i increase by  to  the amount initially allocated to in process research and development  ii increase by  to  the amount initially allocated to fixed assets  and iii allocate  to assembled workforce  all as of the acquisition date in the quarter ended march  in addition  the goodwill write off of  and the cumulative amortization of  relating to this transaction recorded in the quarter ended june   as well as the  recorded for that quarter were reversed and instead the appropriate amortization charge of  has been recorded in each quarter since the date of acquisition 
we have now recorded in the quarter ended december  a write down of  of certain fixed assets which were previously designated as held for sale in that quarter 
previously this write down was recorded in the quarter ended march  we have now recognized into income in the quarter ended december  a  grant from the scottish government which is the period when the conditions relating to the grant were met 
this grant was originally recognized into income into the quarter ended june  the combined effect of these revisions increased our net loss by  in and increased our net income by  in additionally  these revisions reduced fully diluted earnings per share by

after we experienced revenue growth of from to and from to  revenues declined in and then increased in and in annual revenues in and were negatively impacted by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  severe declines in the price of dram components and significantly reduced sales to customers in the communications and networking markets 
these negative conditions continued in the first quarter of but began to improve through the end of as demand for dram products increased and component prices stabilized 
however  there can be no assurance that flash and dram demand or component prices will increase or remain stable or that a turnaround will occur or be sustained 
we expect dram supply to tighten in the second half of  which may require suppliers to place their customers  ourselves included  on limited component allocation 
in addition  we expect strong demand for our stacking and flash product lines to continue through we have experienced an increase in demand for our flash products as a result of the growth in consumer electronics and oem applications  such as the replacement of rotating disk drives with flash products 
our flash revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  despite this growth  our revenues from flash products in the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by flash supply constraints 
we believe the expected addition of new flash suppliers in the industry and increased industry flash capacity in the second half of will have a positive impact on our flash revenues and gross margins as well as our competitiveness in the market 
we sell our products through our consumer division and oem division 
our consumer division sells our products through the following channels var  mail order  distributor and mass market retailer 
our oem division was created in late to enhance the marketing of our products to oems 
we established our xiran division in as a result of our acquisition of the assets of irvine networks  llc  including its intellectual property portfolio 
our xiran division develops advanced board level solutions that optimize server performance for networked storage applications  including ip storage 
in the fourth quarter of  our xiran division made its first shipments and generated nominal revenue in the quarter 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our oem division is typically higher than our consumer division 
we track revenues and gross margins for our consumer  oem and xiran divisions 
we do not track separately  and do not intend to track separately  operating expenses for our consumer and oem divisions 
conversely  we do track operating expenses for our xiran division 
historically  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in cdw computer centers accounted for of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in cdw computer centers and unisys accounted for and of our total revenues in  respectively 
other than cdw computer centers and unisys  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in  and the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our products changes  and we expect this variability will continue in the future 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business risk factors sales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of any key customer would materially reduce our revenues

however  we do face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
see business risk factors we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including foreign currency fluctuations and trade barriers  that could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or an increase in the cost of the components used in our products 
in the past  we have been impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns resulting in lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
other factors  including component price fluctuations  may distort the effect of seasonality 
our ability to adjust our short term operating expenses in response to fluctuations in revenues is limited 
as a result  should revenues decrease to a level lower than expected in any given period  our results of operations would be harmed 
revenues are recognized at the time of shipment 
we face risks associated with declines in the market value of our products  product returns  inventory write downs  price protection and rebates

we believe that our existing assets  cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such 
table of contents funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  price discounts on our products to our customers  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  our pursuit of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  and our relationships with suppliers and customers

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for inventory excess  obsolescence and lower of market values over costs 
we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy  customer demand and unpredictable fluctuations in market values of raw materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts and price protection 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additionally  we maintain allowances for limited price protection rights for inventories of our products held by our customers as a result of recent sales transactions to them 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive a credit from us 
we estimate the impact of such pricing changes on a regular basis and adjust our allowances accordingly 
product returns 
we offer a majority of our customers that purchase products through our consumer channels limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relationships with our customers 
we provide for estimated future returns of inventory at the time of sale based on historical experience  and actual results have been within our expectations 
sales and marketing incentives 
sales and marketing incentives were offset against revenues or charged to operations in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 eitf sales and marketing incentives amounted to million for and million for  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were offset against revenues  and million and million  respectively  were charged as an operating expense 
consideration generally given by us to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of selling price  and therefore  a reduction of revenue 
however  if we receive an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration given to our customer that is sufficiently separable from our sales to that customer  such that we could have paid an independent company to receive that benefit  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit  then the consideration is characterized as an expense 
we estimate the fair value of the benefits we receive by tracking the advertising done by our customers on our behalf and calculating the value of that advertising using a comparable rate for similar publications 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
litigation and other contingencies 
management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  our management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
at december   our investment in marketable securities was million 
the marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit with an original maturity of one year at different financial institutions and auction rate securities 
at december   these marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent investments with an original maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
if interest rates were to decrease  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  were as follows expected maturity date total fair value thereafter investments cash and cash equivalents money market funds weighted average interest rate total cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable securities weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk more than of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of our ic devices from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
fluctuations in the currencies of japan  korea or taiwan could have an adverse impact on the cost of our raw materials 
to date  we have not entered any derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rates
