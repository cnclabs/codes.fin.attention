item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a provider of software solutions and services to the retail industry 
we provide solutions that help retailers understand  create  manage and fulfill consumer demand 
we derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of application software licenses and the provision of related professional and support services 
application software license fees are dependent upon the sales volume of our customers  the number of users of the application s  and or the number of locations in which the customer plans to install and utilize the application s 
as the customer grows in sales volume  adds additional users and or adds additional locations  we charge additional license fees 
we typically charge for support  maintenance and software updates on an annual basis pursuant to renewable maintenance contracts 
we typically charge for professional services including consulting  implementation and project management services on an hourly basis 
in recent periods  we have maintained relatively flat period over period revenues and suffered operating and net losses  largely attributable to general economic and competitive conditions 
however  as economic conditions have improved  we have begun to experience an increase in revenues and profitability 
in this regard  we have taken a number of steps designed to improve our balance sheet and operations  including o acquired two complementary companies with substantial revenues and earnings potential  o revamped our management team by adding a new president and coo and cto  as well as a new cfo  o recapitalized our balance sheet  eliminating substantial debt and raising new equity in its place  o improved our ibm based core products through continuing internal research and development  o obtained the rights to distribute complementary products  including a new easy to install and easy to use  open architecture software system for very small retailers  which we will introduce in  o established partnerships with several value added resellers to provide a variety of options and product extensions  o improved our distribution capabilities by adding new third party channels  such as ibm and ibm s resellers  and professional service firms  such as cgi and lakewest 
we believe that these actions have positioned us to achieve sustained revenue growth and profitability

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including purchase commitments at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payment due by period less than contractual cash obligations total year years years thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations      critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  updated by sab s and  update of codification of staff accounting bulletins  and technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
software license revenue is generally recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
typically  payments for our software licenses are due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred license  prepaid services revenue and maintenance support revenue 
consulting services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training are billed on both an hourly basis and under fixed price contracts 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
we have from time to time provided software and consulting services under fixed price contracts that require the achievement of certain milestones 
the revenue under such arrangements is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
customer support services include post contract support and the rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support services are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or on an annual basis with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fees are allocated to the various elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
o accounts receivable 
we typically extend credit to our customers 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
billings for customer support and consulting services performed on a time and material basis are due upon receipt 
from time to time software and consulting services are provided under fixed price contracts where the revenue and the payment of related receivable balances are due upon the achievement of certain milestones 
management estimates the probability of collection of the receivable balances and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an evaluation of our customers ability to pay and general economic conditions 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
starting fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
resulting in a change in the way we value long term intangible assets and goodwill 
we completed an initial transitional analysis of goodwill impairment as of april  and recorded an impairment of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain events occur 
goodwill is to be measured for impairment by reporting units  which currently consist of our operating segments 
at each impairment test for a business unit  we are required to compare the carrying value of the business unit to the fair value of the business unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill will not be considered impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  we will perform a second test comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the difference if any between the carrying amount of that goodwill and the implied fair value will be recognized as an impairment loss  and the carrying amount of the associated goodwill will be reduced to its implied fair value 
these tests require us to make estimates and assumptions concerning prices for similar assets and liabilities  if available  or estimates and assumptions for other appropriate valuation techniques 
for our intangible assets with finite lives  including our capitalized software and non compete agreements  we assess impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances suggest the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on the net future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset on an undiscounted basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles with finite lives may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
o application development 
the costs to develop new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
technological feasibility has occurred when all planning  designing  coding and testing have been completed according to design specifications 
once technological feasibility is established  any additional costs would be capitalized  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
o stock based compensation 
we do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees as all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  we do not record compensation expense for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we account for costs of stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  discloses the pro forma effect on net income loss and related per share amounts using the fair value method defined in sfas no 
 updated by sfas no 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
further clarifies accounting for derivative instruments 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business risks investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to those described below  risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline and our investors may lose all or part of their investment 
see the note regarding forward looking statements included at the beginning of this form k 
we incurred losses for fiscal years  and we incurred losses of million  million and million in the fiscal years ended march    and respectively 
the losses in the past three years have generally been due to difficulties completing sales for new application software licenses  the resulting change in sales mix toward lower margin services  and debt service expenses 
we will need to generate additional revenue to achieve profitability in future periods 
if we are unable to achieve profitability  or maintain profitability if achieved  our business and stock price may be adversely effected and we may be unable to continue operations at current levels  if at all 
we had negative working capital in prior fiscal year  and we have extended payment terms with a number of our suppliers 
at march   we had negative working capital of million 
we have had difficulty meeting operating expenses  including interest payments on debt  lease payments and supplier obligations 
we have at times deferred payroll for our executive officers  and borrowed from related parties to meet payroll obligations 
we have extended payment terms with our trade creditors wherever possible 
as a result of extended payment arrangements with suppliers  we may be unable to secure products and services necessary to continue operations at current levels from these suppliers 
in that event  we will have to obtain these products and services from other parties  which could result in adverse consequences to our business  operations and financial condition  and we may be unable to obtain these products from other parties on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our net sales have declined in recent fiscal years 
we experienced a substantial decrease in application software license sales 
our growth and profitability is dependent on the sale of higher margin licenses 
our net sales decreased by in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  our net sales decreased by in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  we experienced a substantial decrease in application license software sales in fiscal year and  which typically carry a much higher margin than other revenue sources 
we must improve new application license sales to become profitable 
we have taken steps to refocus our sales strategy on core historic competencies  but our typically long sales cycles make it difficult to evaluate whether and when sales will improve 
we cannot be sure that the decline in sales has not been due to factors which might continue to negatively affect sales 
our financial condition may interfere with our ability to sell new application software licenses 
future sales growth may depend on our ability to improve our financial condition 
our past financial condition has made it difficult for us to complete sales of new application software licenses 
because our applications typically require lengthy implementation and extended servicing arrangements  potential customers require assurance that these services will be available for the expected life of the application 
these potential customers may defer buying decisions until our financial condition improves  or may choose the products of our competitors whose financial conditions are  or are perceived to be  stronger 
customer deferrals or lost sales will adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our sales cycles are long and prospects are uncertain 
this makes it difficult for us to predict revenues and budget expenses 
the length of sales cycles in our business makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our sales strategies 
our sales cycles historically have ranged from three to twelve months  which has caused significant fluctuations in revenues from period to period 
due to our difficulties in completing new application software sales in recent periods and our refocused sales strategy  it is difficult to predict revenues and properly budget expenses 
our software applications are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the retail enterprise 
in many cases  our customers must change established business practices when they install our software 
our sales staff must dedicate significant time consulting with a potential customer concerning the substantial technical and business concerns associated with implementing our products 
the purchase of our products is often discretionary  so lengthy sales efforts may not result in a sale 
moreover  it is difficult to predict when a license sale will occur 
all of these factors can adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results and revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past  and they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  which are outside of our control including the size and timing of orders  the general health of the retail industry  the length of our sales cycles and technological changes 
if revenue declines in a quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  application development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
it is likely that in some future quarter our net sales or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that happens  our stock price will likely decline 
further  due to these fluctuations  we do not believe period to period comparisons of our financial performance are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied on as an indication of our future performance 
we may experience seasonal declines in sales  which could cause our operating results to fall short of expectations in some quarters 
we may experience slower sales of our applications and services from october through december of each year as a result of retailers focus on the holiday retail shopping season 
this can negatively affect revenues in our third fiscal quarter and in other quarters  depending on our sales cycles 
we have relied on capital contributed by related parties  and such capital may not be available in the future 
our cash from operations has not been sufficient to meet our operational needs  and we have relied on capital from related parties 
a company affiliated with donald s 
radcliffe  our former director  made short term loans to us in fiscal and in fiscal to meet payroll 
softline limited softline loaned us million to make a required principal payment on our union bank term loan in july a subsidiary of softline loaned us an additional  in november to meet working capital needs 
this loan was repaid in february  in part with  we borrowed from barry m 
schechter  our former chairman 
we borrowed an additional  from mr 
schechter in march  which was repaid in july  for operational needs related to our australian subsidiary 
we may not be able to obtain capital from related parties in the future 
no officer  director  stockholder or related party is under any obligation to provide cash to meet our future liquidity needs 
we may need to raise capital to grow our business 
obtaining this capital could impair the value of your investment 
we may need to raise capital to o support unanticipated capital requirements  o take advantage of acquisition or expansion opportunities  o continue our current development efforts  o develop new applications or services  or o address working capital needs 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our application development  sales and marketing activities 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds for the above purposes on acceptable terms  we may be forced to curtail some or all of the above activities and we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments 
we may raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new securities may have greater rights  preferences or privileges than our existing common stock 
intangible assets may be impaired making it more difficult to obtain financing 
goodwill  capitalized software  non compete agreements and other intangible assets represent approximately of our total assets as of march  we may have to impair or write off these assets  which will cause a charge to earnings and could cause our stock price to decline 
any such impairment will also reduce our assets  as well as the ratio of our assets to our liabilities 
these balance sheet effects could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital  and could make the terms of capital we do obtain more unfavorable to our existing stockholders 
foreign currency fluctuations may impair our competitive position and affect our operating results 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the prices of our applications and services and our expenses  and foreign currency losses will negatively affect profitability or increase losses 
approximately  and of our net sales from continuing operations were outside north america  principally in australia and the united kingdom  in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
many of our expenses related to foreign sales  such as corporate level administrative overhead and development  are denominated in us dollars 
when accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international sales and services are converted to us dollars  the resulting gain or loss contributes to fluctuations in our operating results 
we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks 
historically we have been dependent on a small number of customers for a significant amount of our business 
qqq systems ltd 
qqq systems accounted for of our net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the software license sale to qqq systems was a one time transaction 
toys r us toys accounted for  and of our net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in november  toys terminated their software development and services agreement with us 
we cannot provide any assurances that qqq systems or any of our current customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or key technical and sales personnel  or if we are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business will be impaired 
we are heavily dependent on our president and chief operating officer  michael tomczak and our chief technology officer  jeffrey boone 
we are also heavily dependent on our former chairman  barry schechter  who remains as a consultant to us 
we do not have a written consulting agreement with mr 
schechter 
we also believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled software programmers  managers  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for personnel is intense  particularly in international markets 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
we compete against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies  for our personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting or retaining skilled sales  technical and managerial personnel  which could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
we are dependent on the retail industry  and if economic conditions in the retail industry further decline  our revenues may also decline 
retail sales have been and may continue to be slow 
our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the licensing of software applications and the performance of related professional and consulting services to the retail industry 
the retail industry as a whole is currently experiencing increased competition and weakening economic conditions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
in addition  the retail industry may be consolidating  and it is uncertain how consolidation will affect the industry 
such consolidation and weakening economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
specifically  uncertain economic conditions and the specter of terrorist activities have adversely impacted sales of our software applications  and we believe mid tier specialty retailers may be reluctant during the current economic climate to make the substantial infrastructure investment that generally accompanies the implementation of our software applications  which may adversely impact our business 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in many geographic regions around the world  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed  and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers who file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be less certain or harder to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the retail software industry 
we conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition 
most of our competitors are very large companies with an international presence 
we must also compete with smaller companies which have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly greater resources than us 
our competitors may also have lower cost structures and better access to the capital markets than us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may o introduce new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive  o make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers  and o establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  which would limit our ability to compete through these channels 
we could be forced to reduce prices and suffer reduced margins and market share due to increased competition from providers of offerings similar to  or competitive with  our applications  or from service providers that provide services similar to our services 
competition could also render our technology obsolete 
for a further discussion of competitive factors in our industry  see description of business competition below 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new applications and related services 
the retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
we must cost effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete 
if we do not gain market acceptance for our existing or new offerings or if we fail to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost effective manner  our financial performance will suffer 
the success of application enhancements and new applications depends on a variety of factors  including technology selection and specification  timely and efficient completion of design  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in developing new applications and services  we may o fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost effective manner  o encounter applications  capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our applications and services obsolete or non competitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing applications and services  o experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new applications and services  or o fail to achieve market acceptance of our applications and services 
the life cycles of our applications are difficult to estimate  particularly in the emerging electronic commerce market 
as a result  new applications and enhancements  even if successful  may become obsolete before we recoup our investment 
our proprietary rights offer only limited protection and our competitors may develop applications substantially similar to our applications and use similar technologies which may result in the loss of customers 
we may have to initiate costly litigation to protect our proprietary rights 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property 
our intellectual property includes our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other proprietary information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be successful 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we hold no patents 
consequently  others may develop  market and sell applications substantially equivalent to ours or utilize technologies similar to those used by us  so long as they do not directly copy our applications or otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights 
we may find it necessary to bring claims or initiate litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
these actions would likely be costly and divert management resources 
these actions could also result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our proprietary rights or alleging infringement on our part 
the ultimate outcome of any litigation will be difficult to predict 
our applications may be subject to claims they infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
we may become subject to litigation involving patents or proprietary rights 
patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs  and we do not know if we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation 
responding to and defending claims related to our intellectual property rights  even ones without merit  can be time consuming and expensive and can divert management s attention from other business matters 
in addition  these actions could cause application delivery delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if they are available at all 
any or all of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
development and marketing of our offerings depends on strategic relationships with other companies 
our existing strategic relationships may not endure and may not deliver the intended benefits  and we may not be able to enter into future strategic relationships 
since we do not possess all of the technical and marketing resources necessary to develop and market our offerings to their target markets  our business strategy substantially depends on our strategic relationships  including licensing software and technology that is integrated into our applications 
while some of these relationships are governed by contracts  most are non exclusive and all may be terminated on short notice by either party 
if these relationships terminate or fail to deliver the intended benefits  our development and marketing efforts will be impaired and our revenues may decline 
we may not be able to enter into new strategic relationships  which could put us at a disadvantage to those of our competitors which do successfully exploit strategic relationships 
our primary computer and telecommunications systems are in a limited number of geographic locations  which makes them more vulnerable to damage or interruption 
this damage or interruption could harm our business 
substantially all of our primary computer and telecommunications systems are located in two geographic areas  and these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  water damage  sabotage  flood  power loss  technical or telecommunications failure or break ins 
our insurance may not adequately compensate us for our lost business and will not compensate us for any liability we incur due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
although we have implemented network security measures  our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these disruptions could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to service our customers 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to serve our customers and harm our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our applications 
our business exposes us to product liability risks 
our applications are highly complex and sophisticated and they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our applications may involve customer specific customization by us or third parties  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
these aspects of our business create additional opportunities for errors and defects in our applications and services 
problems in the initial release may be discovered only after the application has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of other applications and environments 
our applications have in the past contained errors that were discovered after they were sold 
our customers have also occasionally experienced difficulties integrating our applications with other hardware or software in their enterprise 
we are not currently aware of any material defects in our applications that might give rise to future lawsuits 
however  errors or integration problems may be discovered in the future 
such defects  errors or difficulties could result in loss of sales  delays in or elimination of market acceptance  damage to our brand or to our reputation  returns  increased costs and diversion of development resources  redesigns and increased warranty and servicing costs 
in addition  third party products  upon which our applications are dependent  may contain defects which could reduce or undermine entirely the performance of our applications 
our customers typically use our applications to perform mission critical functions 
as a result  the defects and problems discussed above could result in significant financial or other damage to our customers 
although our sales agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  we do not know if these limitations of liability are enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages to a customer resulting from a defect in one of our applications or the performance of our services 
our product liability insurance may not cover all claims brought against us 
the sage group has the right to acquire a significant percentage of our common stock  which if acquired by the sage group  may enable the sage group to exercise effective control of us 
on november   the sage group acquired substantially all of the assets of softline  including softline s  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock which are convertible into  shares of our common stock within days of june    shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the sage group beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  including shares the sage group has the right to acquire upon conversion of its series a convertible preferred stock and exercise of its outstanding options 
although the series a convertible preferred stock is non voting as to most matters and is redeemable by us  if the sage group converts its series a convertible preferred stock to common stock  it may have effective control over all matters affecting us  including o the election of all of our directors  o the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for the sage group and us  o any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us  o the acquisition or disposition of assets or businesses by us  o debt and equity financing  including future issuance of our common stock or other securities  o amendments to our charter documents  o the payment of dividends on our common stock  and o determinations with respect to our tax returns 
the sage group s potential influence on us could make it difficult for another company to acquire us  which could depress our stock price 
the sage group beneficially owns a significant percentage of our common stock 
in addition  two of the current members of our board of directors are employed by a subsidiary of the sage group 
the sage group s potential effective voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or our stockholders 
as a result  the sage group s potential effective control could reduce the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock  or could prevent any party from attempting to acquire us at any price 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
when we or our competitors announce new customer orders or services  change pricing policies  experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results  announce strategic relationships or acquisitions  change earnings estimates  experience government regulatory actions or suffer from generally adverse economic conditions  our stock price could be affected 
some of the volatility in our stock price may be unrelated to our performance 
recently  companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price fluctuations  often for reasons unrelated to their performance 
for further information on our stock price trends  see price range of common stock below 
we have never paid a dividend on our common stock and we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have not previously paid any cash or other dividend on our common stock 
we anticipate that we will use our earnings and cash flow for repayment of indebtedness  to support our operations  and for future growth  and we do not have any plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
holders of our series a convertible preferred stock are entitled to dividends in preference and priority to common stockholders 
future equity financing s may further restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the terms of our preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock in may and  shares of series b convertible preferred stock in june our board of directors may determine the terms of subsequent series of preferred stock without further action by our stockholders 
if we issue additional preferred stock  it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we are actively seeking capital  and some of the arrangements we are considering may involve the issuance of preferred stock 
failure to comply with the american stock exchange s listing standards could result in our delisting from that exchange and limit the ability to sell any of our common stock 
our stock is currently traded on the american stock exchange 
the exchange has published certain guidelines it uses in determining whether a security warrants continued listing 
pursuant to these guidelines the exchange will consider suspending trading in a listed security or delisting a security when  in the opinion of the exchange i the financial condition and or operating results of the issuer appear to be unsatisfactory  ii the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable  iii the issuer has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets  or has ceased to be an operating company  iv the issuer has failed to comply with its listing agreements with the exchange  or v any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted 
as a result of our financial condition or other factors  the american stock exchange could in the future determine that our stock does not merit continued listing 
if our stock were delisted from the american stock exchange  the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock could become limited  and we would lose the advantage of some state and federal securities regulations imposing lower regulatory burdens on exchange traded issuers 
shares issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants  conversion of debentures or dividends on convertible preferred stock or under anti dilution provisions in certain agreements could dilute your stock holdings and adversely affect our stock price 
we have issued options and warrants to acquire common stock to our employees and certain other persons at various prices  some of which are or may in the future have exercise prices at below the market price of our stock 
we currently have outstanding options and warrants for  shares as of june  of these options and warrants  as of june    have exercise prices above the recent market price of per share as of june   and  have exercise prices at or below that recent market price 
our existing stock option plan currently has approximately  shares available for issuance as of june  future options issued under the plan may have further dilutive effects 
the issuance of additional shares pursuant to these options  warrants  convertible debentures or anti dilution provisions will cause immediate and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders 
further  subsequent sales of the shares in the public market could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale 
issuance of these shares and sale of these shares in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities 
substantially all of our authorized common stock is issued and outstanding or is reserved for issuance pursuant to exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of debentures or preferred stock 
our inability to issue additional shares of common stock in the future may limit our ability to raise capital  enter strategic transactions and satisfy contractual obligations 
our authorized capital stock under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is  shares of common stock   of which were issued and outstanding as of june  and  shares of preferred stock consisting of  shares of series a preferred  all of which were issued and outstanding as of june   and  series b preferred stock  all of which were issued and outstanding as of june  in addition  we have  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of options or warrants or conversion of debentures or preferred stock 
as a result  we only have  authorized shares of common stock that are not reserved and that may be issued for any future business purposes 
we intend to submit a proposal to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue from  to  to our stockholders at our next annual meeting and certain of our stockholders and members of management have signed voting agreements obligating them to vote their shares in favor of such amendment at the meeting 
however  there can be no assurances that such a proposal will be approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders 
if we are unable to increase our authorized common stock our ability to obtain additional capital through sales of our common stock  to engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions and to satisfy contractual commitments will be severely limited 
we may be unable to successfully integrate our operations with page digital or rti or realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
on january   we acquired page digital and on june   we acquired retail technologies  inc see recent transactions below 
these acquisitions involve integrating two companies that previously operated independently into island pacific 
these integrations will be complex  costly and time consuming processes 
the difficulties of combining these companies operations include  among other things o coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  o strain on management resources due to integration demands  o integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  o consolidating corporate and administrative functions  o coordinating product development  o coordinating sales and marketing functions  o retaining key employees  and o preserving relationships with key customers 
business risks faced by page digital could disadvantage our business 
page digital is a developer of multi channel commerce software and faces several business risks that could disadvantage our business 
these risks include many of the risks that we face  described above  as well as o long and variable sales cycles make it difficult to predict operating results historically  the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of page digital s products has ranged from one to twelve months 
page digital s average sales cycle is currently three months 
the licensing of page digital s products is often an enterprise wide decision by customers that involves a significant commitment of resources by page digital and its prospective customer 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase page digital s products  including product benefits  cost and time of implementation  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
as a part of the sales process  page digital spends a significant amount of resources informing prospective customers about the use and benefits of page digital products  which may not result in a sale  therefore increasing operating expenses 
as a result of this sales cycle  page digital s revenues are unpredictable and could vary significantly from quarter to quarter causing our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
o defects in products could diminish demand for products and result in loss of revenues from time to time errors or defects may be found in page digital s existing  new or enhanced products  resulting in delays in shipping  loss of revenues or injury to page digital s reputation 
page digital s customers use its products for business critical applications 
any defects  errors or other performance problems could result in damage to page digital s customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from page digital for any losses 
further  errors or defects in page digital s products may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into page digital products 
if so  page digital may not be able to fix these defects without the assistance of the software providers 
o failure to formalize and maintain relationships with systems integrators could reduce revenues and harm page digital s ability to implement products a significant portion of page digital s sales are influenced by the recommendations of systems integrators  consulting firms and other third parties who assist with the implementation and maintenance of page digital s products 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support page digital s products 
failing to maintain strong relationships with these third parties could result in a shift by these third parties toward favoring competing products  which could negatively affect page digital s software license and service revenues 
o page digital s product markets are subject to rapid technological change  so page digital s success depends heavily on its ability to develop and introduce new applications and related services the retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
page digital must cost effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete 
if page digital fails to gain market acceptance for its existing or new offerings or if page digital fails to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost effective manner  our financial performance may suffer 
o failure to protect proprietary rights or intellectual property  or intellectual property infringement claims against page digital could result in page digital losing valuable assets or becoming subject to costly and time consuming litigation page digital s success and ability to compete depend on its proprietary rights and intellectual property 
page digital relies on trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect its proprietary rights and intellectual property 
page digital also has one issued patent 
despite page digital s efforts to protect intellectual property  a third party could obtain access to page digital s software source code or other proprietary information without authorization  or could independently duplicate page digital s software 
page digital may need to litigate to enforce intellectual property rights 
if page digital is unable to protect its intellectual property it may lose a valuable asset 
further  third parties could claim page digital has infringed their intellectual property rights 
any claims  regardless of merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend 
o competition in the software market is intense and could reduce page digital s sales or prevent them from achieving profitability the market for page digital s products is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of page digital s market share  any one of which could reduce future revenues or earnings 
further  most of page digital s competitors are large companies with greater resources  broader customer relationships  greater name recognition and an international presence 
as a result  page digital s competitors may be able to better respond to new and emerging technologies and customer demands 
business risks faced by rti could disadvantage our business 
rti is a provider of retail management store solutions to small through mid tier retailers via an international network of retailers and faces several business risks that could disadvantage our business 
these risks include many of the risks that we face  described above  as well as o rti faces intense competition in the retail point of sale industry rti operates in an extremely competitive industry  which is subject to rapid technological and market changes 
we anticipate that the competition will increase as more companies focus on providing technology solutions to small and mid tier retailers 
many of our current and potential competitors  such as microsoft  have more resources to devote to product development  marketing and distribution 
while rti believes that it has competitive strengths in its market  there can be no assurance that rti will continue to compete successfully against larger more established competitors 
o rti is dependent on their value added reselllers vars rti does not have a direct sales force and relies on vars to distribute and sell its products 
rti currently has approximately vars in north america  in south america  in asia  in europe and the middle east  in africa  and each in australia and new zealand 
combined  rti s four largest vars account for approximately of its revenues  although no one is over 
rti s vars are independently owned businesses and there can be no assurance that one or more will not go out of business or cease to sell rti products 
until a replacement var could be recruited  and trained  or until an existing var could expand into the vacated territory  such a loss could result in a disruption in rti s revenue and profitability 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that an adequate replacement could be located 
o a prolonged slowdown in the global economy could adversely impact rti s revenues a slowdown in the global economy might lead to decreased capital spending  fewer new retail business start ups  and slower new store expansion at existing retail businesses 
such conditions  even on a regional basis could severely impact one or more of rti s vars and result to a disruption in rti s revenues  and profitability 
o rti s product markets are subject to rapid technological change  so rti s success depends heavily on its ability to develop and introduce new applications and related services we believe rti s ability to succeed in its market is partially dependent on its ability to identify new product opportunities and rapidly  cost effectively bring them to market 
however  there is no guarantee that they will be able to gain market acceptance for any new products 
in addition  there is no guarantee that one of rti competitors will not be able to bring competing applications to market faster or market them more effectively 
failure to successfully develop new products  bring them to market and gain market acceptance could result in decreased market share and ultimately have a material adverse affect on rti 
o rti does not hold any patents or copyrights  any termination of or adverse change to rti s license rights could have a material adverse effect on its business rti has a license to develop  modify  market  sell  and support its core technology from a third party 
any termination of  or disruption in this license could have a material adverse affect on rti s business 
further  we believe that most of the technology used in the design and development of rti s core products is widely available to others 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not develop  and market applications that are similar to rti s  or utilize technologies that are equivalent to rti s 
likewise  while rti believes that its products do not infringe on any third party s intellectual property  there can be no assurance that they will not become involved in litigation involving intellectual property rights 
if such litigation did occur  it could have a material adverse affect on rti s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar 
interest rate risk we do not have financial instruments with variable interest rates or investment securities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe 
sales are typically denominated in the local foreign currency  which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through decentralized sales  development  marketing and support operations  in which substantially all costs are local currency based 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the foreign currency 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risk 
approximately  and of our total net sales from continuing operations were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods ended march   and  respectively 
equity price risk we have no direct equity investments
