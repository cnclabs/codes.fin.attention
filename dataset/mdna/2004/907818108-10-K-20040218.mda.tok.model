item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and other information included in this report 
the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates is our one reportable business segment 
the consolidated financial statements also include discontinued trucking operations  consisting of otc and motor cargo  which are subsidiaries of overnite  inc  formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of upc 
in  we reclassified our trucking operations as discontinued operations 

table of contents executive summary highlights revenue growth we increased operating revenues by year over year to billion  the highest level in our history  despite a sluggish economy during the first half of the year 
record revenue levels were achieved in five of our major commodity groups agricultural  automotive  energy  industrial products and intermodal 
the higher revenue was primarily attributable to increased carloads of these commodities  improved average revenue per car and fuel surcharges  and reflects the revenue diversity of our rail franchise  as well as continued focus on our yield strategy 
the key components of our yield strategy are providing premium service for a premium price and achieving a mix of business that maximizes profitability 
free cash flow we generated net free cash flow of million excluding proceeds from the overnite ipo 
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities  less dividends paid  less non cash financings plus non cash acquisitions 
net free cash flow is free cash flow less cash from the sale of discontinued operations 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure by sec regulation g 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than a substitute for cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid non cash financings non cash acquisitions free cash flow proceeds from sale of discontinued operations net free cash flow overnite ipo we sold of overnite through an initial public offering 
this resulted in a gain of million including an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter 
we generated million in cash proceeds from the offering 
dividend increase reflecting our increased financial strength and improvement of our balance sheet  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by to per share  following an increase of in improved balance sheet we significantly improved our balance sheet by redeeming billion of convertible preferred securities cps with cash from operations and the proceeds of the overnite offering 
the remaining million of cps was refinanced with new unsecured debt with comparably favorable terms 
credit rating upgrade the corporation s long term unsecured credit rating was upgraded by moody s to baa  which followed an upgrade by standard and poor s to bbb in these upgrades reflect our improved balance sheet and will provide us more flexibility with respect to access to capital markets and meeting our financing requirements 

table of contents challenges energy prices energy prices were high throughout the year  increasing our operating expenses by million over however  our fuel surcharge programs offset about of these higher fuel costs 
our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover a portion of the increase in fuel expense from customers in the form of higher revenue 
uncertain economy continued weakness in the us economy  created a very difficult business environment during the first half of us industrial production in the first half of was flat compared to the first half of the second half of was up compared to the second half of the impact of this early weakness can be seen in our carload volumes 
carloads for the first three quarters of were flat year over year  with fourth quarter carloads up 
network performance our network performance and operating efficiency were adversely affected in the third and fourth quarters by a shortage of trainmen and engineers  combined with an expanded summer track maintenance program and fourth quarter record level volumes 
programs have been put in place  which we believe should remedy the situation  including  among other things  hiring and training additional employees and accelerating certain locomotive acquisitions 
expectations revenue growth we expect to build on the positive momentum generated during the fourth quarter of  targeting year over year commodity revenue growth of to percent for the full year we are projecting increases in all of our major commodity groups with the exception of energy  which may be slightly down 
we expect the largest percentage increases in the intermodal  automotive and agricultural groups  and we should see steady but more modest increases in revenue from chemicals and industrial products shipments 
energy prices fuel prices will remain susceptible to price volatility 
to help reduce the impact of fuel price volatility on earnings  we will continue to leverage our fuel surcharge programs  and we will continue to adhere to our hedging strategy 
capital spending in  we expect to spend approximately billion on capital expenditures  including capital leases 
these expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build infrastructure and develop and implement new technologies 
our capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations  additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties 
we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected cash requirements 
free cash flow we will continue to focus on free cash flow in  with a target of million

table of contents risk factors we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers we are subject to competition from other railroads  which operate parallel routes in many of our traffic corridors  in addition to motor carriers and  to a lesser extent  ships  barges and pipelines 
competition can pressure both transit time requirements and pricing  as well as place a greater emphasis on the rate charged and the quality and reliability of the service provided 
while we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system  trucks and barges are able to use public rights of way maintained by public entities 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate  or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal  state and local authorities with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health  safety  labor  environmental  as discussed below  and other matters 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
governments may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our business 
also  some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and other authorizations  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so 
we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters and the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
we generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our current operations  and we have done so in our former operations 
environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties  leased properties and properties owned by third parties  as well as to properties currently owned and used by us 
environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation 
we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that we have violated  or are strictly liable under  these laws or regulations 
although  we have appropriately recorded current and long term liabilities for known future environmental costs  we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing  and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known  unknown or future environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
rising fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our business fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses 
diesel fuel prices are subject to dramatic fluctuations 
significant price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
additionally  fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by international political and economic circumstances 
if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from opec production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  higher fuel prices and any subsequent price increases would  despite our fuel surcharge programs  materially affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the majority of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states 
some of these agreements expire within the next two years 
disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs 
we may be affected by general economic conditions several of the commodities we transport come from industries with cyclical business operations 
as a result  prolonged negative changes in domestic and global 
table of contents economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena  including earthquakes  fires and floods  may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs  increased liabilities and decreased revenues  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are dependent on two key suppliers of locomotives due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotives  there are strong barriers to entry for new suppliers 
therefore  if one of these suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives  we could realize a significant increase in the cost and the potential for reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations 
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  personal injury and property damage  environmental and other matters 
any material changes to current litigation trends could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we may be affected by future acts of terrorism or war or risk of war terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  our ability to raise capital or our future growth 
our rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror  which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
any act of terror  retaliatory strike  sustained military campaign or war or risk of war may have an adverse impact on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity by causing or resulting in unpredictable operating or financial conditions  including disruptions of rail lines  volatility or sustained increase of fuel prices  fuel shortages  general economic decline and instability or weakness of financial markets which could restrict our ability to raise capital 
in addition  insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverages currently maintained by us could increase dramatically  or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following are our critical accounting policies that affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
depreciation the railroad industry is capital intensive 
properties are carried at cost 
provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group  based on the results of a depreciation study 
we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property  to the surface transportation board for review and approval 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation  and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition 
the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
an obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis 

table of contents capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december   including non cash financings of million 
in  we implemented depreciation studies  approved by the surface transportation board  resulting in lower depreciation expense of million for the year ended december   due to a reduction in depreciation rates for certain track assets effective january   partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets effective july  
for the year ended december   depreciation expense was billion 
various methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by million 
if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by million 
environmental we generate and transport hazardous and non hazardous waste in our current operations and have done so in our former operations  and we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we have identified approximately sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
when an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned  leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on such property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws and regulations 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
however  the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and or the speculative nature of remediation costs 
for the year ended december  and  we recorded environmental expenses of million and million for continuing operations  respectively 
as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million  respectively  of which million and million were classified as current 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
based on that analysis  we have determined that a valuation allowance is not appropriate at december  
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non union employees through qualified and non qualified supplemental pension plans 
qualified and non qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment with specific reductions made for early retirements 
we also provide other postretirement benefits opeb 
all non union and certain of our union employees participate in defined contribution medical and life insurance programs for retirees 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions fas and our postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions fas 
fas and fas require us to make various estimates and assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  expected rates of return on plan assets  salary increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated employee mortality rates and expected future healthcare costs 
the estimates we used are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances and are updated at least annually 
we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these benefits 
funded status the funded status of our pension plans represents the difference between the fair value of pension assets and the present value of pension liabilities projected benefit obligation  or pbo 
the pbo is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants  including the effect of assumed future salary increases 
the funded status is impacted by actual asset returns and cash funding  as well as a year end discount rate  which is used to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation 
the discount rate we use for this purpose is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans expected benefit payments 
the opeb plan is unfunded and funding occurs as claims are paid 
the pbo of the opeb plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation  as the present value of opeb liabilities is not affected by salary increases 
the discount rate used in valuing opeb obligations is equal to the pension discount rate for both and the following table presents the funded status of our pension and opeb plans  as well as the key assumptions that impact the funded status as of december  millions of dollars pension benefits opeb funded status fair value of plan assets projected benefit obligation funded status assumptions discount rate salary increase n a health care cost trend rate current n a level in n a

however  actual cash funding is governed by employee benefit and tax laws 
no cash funding was required for us in during  we voluntarily contributed million to our funded pension plan 
contributions required subsequent to are dependent on asset returns and future discount rates 
we do not anticipate minimum pension funding requirements in we voluntarily contributed million in january of to help mitigate any potential required funding in the future 
future contributions are expected to be funded primarily by cash generated from operating activities 
cash funding for opeb benefits is based on claims paid 
claims paid  net of retiree contributions  totaled million and million for and  respectively 
expected claims for total million  net of employee contributions 
expense pension expense for was million  while we recorded pension income in of million 
opeb expense for and was million and million  respectively 
both pension and opeb expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and the interest cost on those liabilities  less the expected return on pension plan assets for pension only 
with respect to the value of pension plan assets  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a five year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in pension expense  but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long term rate of return assumptions 
the expected rate of return on assets was for and for differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized immediately  but are deferred and  if necessary  amortized as pension or opeb expense

we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability 
compensation for work related accidents is governed by the federal employers liability act fela 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
annual expenses for our personal injury related events were million and million in and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million accrued for future personal injury costs  respectively  of which million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs in both years 
we have additional amounts accrued for claims related to certain alleged occupational illnesses 
changes in estimates can vary due to evolving trends in litigation related to personal injury and occupational illness cases based on large jury awards and public pressures associated with certain occupational related injuries 
results of operations millions of dollars  except per share amounts and ratios income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income diluted earnings per share income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations as a percentage of operating revenues return on average common shareholders equity operating margin income from continuing operations the decrease in income from continuing operations in compared to was driven by higher fuel prices  inflation  network costs including expenses associated with increased volumes  lower gains from real estate sales asset sales with the utah transit authority uta for 
table of contents million pre tax and the santa clara valley transportation authority vta for million pre tax and debt redemption expenses  which more than offset revenue gains  lower interest expense and productivity improvements 
conversely  the increase in income from continuing operations in compared to resulted from double digit operating income growth  lower interest costs  the two large asset sale transactions mentioned previously and tax adjustments of million  reflecting the outcome of income tax examinations for prior years 
operating income in improved as revenue growth  productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation  increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 
productivity is measured by both gross ton miles per inflation adjusted expense dollar and gross ton miles per employee 
gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of a loaded or empty freight car by the number of miles hauled 
operating revenues operating revenue is comprised of commodity revenue and other revenues 
other revenues primarily include subsidiary revenue from various companies that are wholly owned or majority owned by the railroad  revenue from the chicago commuter rail operations and accessorial revenue earned due to customer detainment of railroad owned or controlled equipment 
we recognize commodity revenues on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
operating revenues increased million to billion in over  following an increase of million in over commodity revenue increased million in and million in the increase in was driven by growth in the industrial products  agricultural  intermodal and energy commodity groups  including revenue from our fuel surcharge programs  while the increase in was a result of growth in the automotive  intermodal  agricultural and industrial products commodity groups 
revenue carloads increased and in and  respectively  while average revenue per car referred to as arc increased to  in and was  and  in and  respectively 
other revenue increased million in and million in  driven by increased passenger  subsidiary and accessorial revenues in both years 
the following tables summarize the year over year changes in commodity revenue  revenue carloads and average revenue per car by commodity type commodity revenue in millions of dollars agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total revenue carloads in thousands agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total 
table of contents average revenue per car agricultural automotive chemicals energy industrial products intermodal total agricultural revenue in rose due to a improvement in arc and a increase in carloads following revenue growth of in  resulting from a gain in arc and a growth in carloads 
in  the improvement was driven by higher wheat demand for gulf exports  in addition to added ethanol shipments resulting from heightened demand for the fuel additive 
revenue gains were also achieved through additional shipments of sugar beets due to a favorable crop in and canned and packaged foods resulting from additional  longer haul shipments from the west coast 
arc grew due to the positive mix impact of longer average length of haul shipments  as well as price increases and fuel surcharges 
in  revenues grew due to strong export demand and more shipments to mexico 
revenue gains were also achieved through increased shipments of cottonseed  ethanol used as a fuel additive and frozen french fries 
arc rose due to higher average length of haul  resulting from fewer short haul empty storage moves and corn processor shipments  combined with additional long haul meals and oils and animal feed shipments 
automotive revenue increased in as a result of a slight rise in both carloads and arc following an increase in  which resulted from a gain in carloads and growth in arc 
revenue growth was the result of additional volume due to market share gains for materials shipments  partially offset by a decline in revenues from domestic manufacturers  as the softening economy weakened demand for finished vehicles and forced production cuts 
arc was up slightly in  as price increases were partially offset by the mix impact of disproportionate growth in materials shipments  which move at a lower arc than finished vehicles 
in  volume growth resulted from market share gains for finished vehicles  where carloads were up despite a decline in us light vehicle sales 
materials shipments declined  due primarily to reduced production in mexico 
market share gains partially offset the decline 
arc increased as a result of a shift in mix  resulting from increased higher arc vehicles shipments and a decline in lower arc materials shipments 
in addition  average length of haul for vehicle shipments increased due to mix of business 
chemicals revenue in grew  as a decline in carloads was offset by a increase in arc 
revenue in rose as a result of a increase in carloads offset by a decrease in arc 
in  reduced plastics volume led the decline in carloads as the soft economy combined with higher input costs caused producers to lower inventories and reduce shipments 
growth of market demand for domestic and export soda ash partially offset the decline 
arc improved due to a mix shift toward longer average length of haul moves  driven by fewer cars in storage in transit  in addition to price increases and fuel surcharges 
conversely  in  volume rose for liquid and dry chemicals due to relatively higher economic demand from industrial manufacturers 
plastics shipments rose as a result of increased demand for consumer durables 
revenue also grew due to higher domestic demand for fertilizer and demand for domestic and export soda ash shipments 
arc declined during  as a result of changes in customer contract terms 
energy revenue climbed in compared to a decrease in in  strong utility demand due to lower inventories in the last three quarters more than offset the absence of export traffic from the colorado and utah mining regions which japan is now sourcing from other far eastern producers  resulting in a increase in carloads 
fourth quarter carloads were the highest ever from the southern powder river basin and colorado and utah mining regions 
during  tonnage moved from the southern powder river basin was also the highest ever for us 
arc increased  primarily due to index based contract escalators 
conversely  the 
table of contents revenue decrease was driven by a decrease in arc 
arc declined due to the impact of contract price negotiations on expiring long term contracts with certain major customers 
increased carloads and coal trains loaded per day in the southern powder river basin in wyoming were offset by reduced west coast export shipments originating from the colorado and utah mining regions 
industrial products revenue increased and in and  respectively 
revenue in was driven by growth in arc and a improvement in carloads  which was attributable to government  steel and lumber business growth 
the increase in government shipments was driven by movement of military equipment and ammunition in support of the war effort 
lumber positively impacted carloads  as housing starts and low interest rates continue to drive demand 
steel and scrap shipments also increased as the weakening dollar created higher domestic and export demand for us produced steel  augmented by market share gains 
arc rose due to price increases  fuel surcharges and more high arc lumber moves 
revenue in was primarily driven by a increase in arc  augmented with a slight improvement in carloads 
increased lumber shipments were the primary growth driver  due to strong housing construction and greater production in the pacific northwest region 
stone shipments grew due to strong building and road construction activity in the south 
higher general demand for paper and newsprint commodities also positively impacted revenues 
reduced shipments of steel and metallic shipments in the first three quarters partially offset these increases 
however  steel shipments rebounded in the fourth quarter as new us tariffs made domestic producers more price competitive with foreign producers 
arc improved due to price increases and a greater mix of longer average length of haul 
intermodal revenue climbed in driven by a increase in arc and a gain in carloads  which followed a increase in revenue for on the strength of a gain in carloads 
in  carloads were up due to strong imports and improved economic conditions as well as the year over year impact of the labor dispute between the international longshoreman and warehouse union ilwu and the pacific maritime association pma which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of arc in improved due to fuel surcharges and price increases 
revenue in increased resulting from strong import demand  truck conversion and price increases 
these gains were partially offset by the ilwu pma labor dispute  which had a significant impact on intermodal volumes during the fourth quarter  primarily in october 
the slight increase in arc was the result of price increases  offset by the mix impact of a greater number of lower revenue per car international shipments 
mexico business included in the commodity revenue reported above is revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
this revenue grew to million in compared to a increase to million for business growth in was led by market share gains in auto parts shipments and increased revenue for agricultural products resulting from higher corn and meal exports  as well as increased beer imports 
in  shipments increased for agricultural products  chemicals  and industrial products commodity groups 
increased revenue for agricultural products resulted from higher corn and meal exports  as well as increased beer imports 
increased chemicals business consisted of plastics exports  in addition to higher imports and exports of liquid and dry chemicals 
reduced automobile production partially offset these gains resulting in fewer shipments of finished vehicles 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million to billion in compared to  following an increase of million to billion in compared to the increase in expenses was due primarily to higher fuel prices in addition to wage and benefit inflation and volume related costs  as gross ton miles increased for the year 
a reduction in employment levels  combined with lower depreciation expense and cost control efforts partially offset the increase 
cost control efforts are defined as focused actions to reduce discretionary spending and failure costs 
expenses in the third and fourth quarters were also negatively affected by increased crew and asset utilization costs  associated with a deterioration in network fluidity as discussed under other matters in this item the increase in expenses reflects wage and benefit inflation  higher equipment rents  depreciation expenses and increased purchased services and other costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employment levels  lower fuel prices and cost control efforts 
salaries  wages and employee benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in of million was driven by the 
table of contents adoption of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas  which accounted for million of the increase 
other drivers included inflation  volume related costs driven by a increase in gross ton miles  protection costs  increased crew utilization costs due to a shortage of available crews and pension expense 
protection cost represents the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee s protected rate of pay 
an individual s protected rate is imposed by the surface transportation board for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements in other cases 
the increase in of million was primarily driven by inflation and volume related costs associated with a increase in gross ton miles 
a reduction in employee force levels in conjunction with worker productivity improvements partially offset the inflation and higher volume related costs 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal and locomotive leases  other specialty equipped vehicle leases  and office and other rentals 
expenses decreased million in compared to  following an increase of million in from the decrease in was due primarily to lower rental prices for private railcars  partially offset by higher locomotive lease expense and increased car cycle times driven by higher inventory of cars on the system due to slower network train speed in the third and fourth quarters 
conversely  the increase in expense in compared to was driven by higher locomotive leases and volume related costs  partially offset by savings from lower car cycle times 
car cycle time for equipment and other rents is defined as the average number of accumulated days that loaded and empty cars from other railroads spend on uprr s system 
the higher locomotive lease expense in both years is attributable to the railroad s increased leasing of new  more reliable and fuel efficient locomotives 
these new locomotives replaced older  non leased models in the fleet  which helped reduce expenses for depreciation  labor  materials and fuel during each year 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties and other track material 
depreciation expense decreased million in from levels  following an increase of million in compared to the decrease was driven by the adoption of fas as well as the implementation of depreciation studies approved by the surface transportation board  which resulted in lower depreciation rates in for certain track assets  partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets 
conversely  capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of depreciable assets  partially offsetting the favorable impact of fas and the depreciation studies in the increase in expenses for compared to resulted primarily from a higher depreciable asset base 
fuel and utilities fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone and gasoline and other fuels 
expenses increased million in over compared to a decrease of million in versus the increase in and decrease in were driven by fuel prices  which averaged  and cents per gallon in  and  respectively including taxes and transportation costs 
the higher fuel price in contributed million to the increase  however  approximately of these costs were recovered through our fuel surcharge programs and are included in operating revenues 
a and increase in gross ton miles in and resulted in an additional million and million in fuel expense 
additionally  the railroad hedged approximately and of its fuel consumption for and  in accordance with its policy applicable to hedging  which decreased fuel costs by million in and million in materials and supplies materials used for the maintenance of the railroad s lines  structures and equipment is the principal component of materials and supplies expense 
office  small tools and other supplies and the costs of freight services purchased to ship company materials are also included 
expenses decreased by million in and million in the lower expense in was primarily driven by costs associated with track removal 
additionally  expense in both and  decreased due to fewer locomotives repaired  cost control measures and a shift to more contracting of locomotive repairs  which resulted in a corresponding increase to purchased services and other costs 
the reduction was partially offset by higher costs for locomotive materials  while the decrease in expense was partially offset by higher costs for freight car repairs 

table of contents casualty costs the largest component of casualty costs is personal injury expense 
freight and property damage  insurance  environmental matters and occupational illness expense are also included in casualty costs 
costs in increased million following an increase of million in the increase in was driven by higher personal injury expense  insurance costs due to increased premiums and expenses associated with destruction of foreign equipment 
destruction of foreign equipment expense is incurred when equipment owned by other railroads is damaged while in our possession 
higher personal injury and insurance costs in were partially offset by lower costs for freight damage and destruction of foreign equipment 
purchased services and other costs purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  state and local taxes  net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads  transportation and lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  telephone and cellular expense  employee travel expense and computer and other general expenses 
expenses increased million in  as a result of higher state and local taxes  increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense 
crew transportation costs and trucking expenses for intermodal containers also increased due to network performance 
state and local taxes increased primarily as a result of higher income levels used to assess property taxes 
growth in contract services was primarily driven by higher costs for contracting of locomotive maintenance referenced in materials and supplies and contract related expenses resulting from the cost of track removal 
joint facilities costs were up due to reduced haulage receipts and increased expenses associated with a new joint facility contract 
expenses increased million in  as a result of higher state and local taxes  increased spending for contract services and joint facility expense 
operating income operating income decreased million to billion in following an increase of million to billion in in  revenue growth  productivity gains and lower depreciation expense were more than offset by higher fuel prices  inflation  volume and resource utilization costs 
in  revenue growth  productivity gains and lower fuel prices more than offset inflation  increased depreciation expense and higher rail costs due to increased rail volume 
non operating items interest expense decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the improvement in both years was a result of lower weighted average debt levels  including the convertible preferred securities  of  million   million and  million in  and  as well as lower weighted average interest rates of in  in and in other income fell million in  following an increase of million in the reduction in and increase in were primarily a result of higher real estate gains asset sales to the utah transit authority with a pre tax value of million and the santa clara valley transit authority with a pre tax value of million 
other income for was also negatively affected by redemption costs associated with the early retirement of billion of convertible preferred securities 
income tax expense decreased million in versus an increase of million in over the decrease in was driven by lower pre tax income  which was partially offset by a tax adjustment recognized in for prior years income tax examinations 
the increase in income tax expense for resulted from higher pre tax income in  which was partially offset by the tax adjustment previously mentioned 
discontinued operations revenues from discontinued operations were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
revenues for decreased as a result of the loss of november and december revenues due to the sale of our trucking interest on november  the decrease was partially offset by increased volume  yield improvements and price improvements 
the increase in revenues for was due to volume growth  yield improvements and higher revenue for special services  partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices in income from discontinued operations was million  million and million in  and income from discontinued operations in included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of million  including an income tax benefit of million  while income included a 
table of contents one time benefit of million as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters with the internal revenue service  which was accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense during the period 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of receivables and revolving credit facilities  as well as issuance of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of credit facilities available  of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
receivables sold as of december  were million 
in january  we reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by million to million  due to a decrease in available receivables at december  access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
at december  and  we had a working capital deficit of million and million  respectively 
a working capital deficit is not uncommon in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
financial condition cash from operations was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase from to is due to working capital performance and cash from the discontinued operations  partially offset by lower income from continuing operations 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by pension plan funding 
cash used in investing activities was million  billion and billion in  and the reduction in is primarily driven by proceeds of million from the sale of our trucking interest  which was partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales and increased capital spending 
the amount decreased slightly from to as higher real estate sales  a warranty refund from a vendor and a dividend from an affiliate in were partially offset by higher capital spending 
the table below details capital expenditures for the years ended december   and including non cash financings of million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures millions of dollars track locomotives freight cars facilities and other total cash used in financing activities was billion  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to reflects higher debt repayments of billion in including billion of convertible preferred securities compared to billion in  and higher dividend payments  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
the increase from to reflects lower financings million in versus million in  partially offset by an increase in stock option exercise proceeds of million and slightly lower debt repayments 

table of contents we expect to spend approximately billion on capital expenditures in  including capital leases 
our capital expenditures and debt service requirements are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations  additional debt financings and the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties 
including the convertible preferred securities as an equity instrument  the ratio of debt to total capital employed was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in our ratio in is due to the redemption of the billion of convertible preferred securities and higher debt levels  partially offset by higher equity levels 
the reduction in is due to lower debt levels and higher equity balances 
for the years ended december   and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was  and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is based on continuing operations 
earnings represent income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change  less equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
the change in our ratio is due primarily to the changes in our income from continuing operations 
financing activities credit facilities we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december  commercial paper is issued from time to time for working capital needs and is supported by billion in credit facilities 
our credit facilities include million of day revolving credit facilities expiring in march  and billion of year revolving credit facilities expiring in march we have the option to hold higher cash balances in addition to or in replacement of the credit facilities to support commercial paper 
these credit facilities also allow for borrowings at floating libor based rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the credit facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facilities do not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing or any provision that could require the posting of collateral 
the credit facilities are designated for general corporate purposes  and none of the credit facilities were used as of december  commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers 
we are reviewing rollover options for the credit facilities 
to the extent we have long term credit facilities available  we have reclassified certain short term debt on a long term basis 
at december  and  approximately million and million of short term borrowings that we intend to refinance were reclassified as long term debt 
this reclassification reflects our intent to refinance these short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis through the issuance of commercial paper or new long term financings  or by using the currently available long term credit facility if alternative financing is not available 
redemption of convertible preferred securities during  we exercised our option to redeem the entire billion of the convertible preferred securities cps 
the cps were issued in april by our wholly owned subsidiary  union pacific capital trust  at a price of each and paid quarterly cash dividends at an annual rate of 
the redemption was funded with a combination of cash from operations  the issuance of million of debt in june  and cash proceeds from the initial public offering of overnite 
the billion redemption  net of the million debt issuance  will reduce interest expense by approximately million  pre tax  annually and eliminate the dilutive effect of the cps on earnings per share 
total one time costs incurred in  associated with the redemption  were approximately million and are included in other income

during february  under the shelf 
table of contents registration  we issued million of fixed rate debt with a maturity of february  the proceeds of the issuance were used for repayment of debt and other general corporate purposes 
on june   we issued million of fixed rate debt with a maturity of june  and million of fixed rate debt with a maturity of june  the proceeds of the issuance were used to redeem million of cps on july  in december  we filed a new billion shelf registration statement  which became effective december  under this shelf registration statement  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
at december   we had million remaining for issuance under the shelf registration and the full billion for issuance under the new shelf registration 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities in to replace existing debt and otherwise access capital through issuances of debt securities under these registrations 
during may  we entered into a capital lease covering new locomotives 
the related capital lease obligation totaled approximately million and is included in the consolidated statements of financial position as debt 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  item  and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in addition  the commercial obligations  financings and commitments made by us are customary transactions which are similar to those of other comparable industrial corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december  sale of receivables the railroad has sold without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to investors through union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
at december  and  upri had transferred million and million  respectively  of accounts receivable to the investors 
upri subsequently sells an interest in such pool to the investors and retains an undivided interest in a portion of these receivables 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  upri had a retained interest of million and million  respectively 
the outstanding undivided interest held by investors of million and million at december  and  respectively  is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
these sold receivables are no longer included in our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the program was renewed for one year with a capacity to sell to the investors an undivided interest in accounts receivable of million 
the amount of receivables sold fluctuates based upon the availability of the amount of receivables eligible for sale and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of receivables available for sale would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the amount of receivables sold would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors have the right to discontinue this reinvestment 
the investors have designated the railroad to service the sold receivables  however  no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
payments collected from sold receivables can be reinvested in new receivables on behalf of the buyers 
proceeds from collections reinvested in the program were approximately billion in both and in january  upri reduced the outstanding undivided interest held by investors by million to million  due to a decrease in available receivables at december  headquarters building the railroad has a synthetic operating lease arrangement to finance a new headquarters building  which is being constructed in omaha  nebraska 
the expected completion date of the building is mid it will total approximately million square feet with approximately  office workspaces 
the cost to construct the new headquarters  including capitalized interest  is approximately million 
we have guaranteed all of the railroad s obligation under this lease 

table of contents uprr is the construction agent for the lessor during the construction period 
the railroad has guaranteed  in the event of a loss caused by  or resulting from  our actions or failures to act as construction agent  of the building related construction costs incurred up to that point during the construction period 
total building related costs incurred and drawn from the lease funding commitments as of december   were approximately million 
accordingly  the railroad s guarantee at december   was approximately million 
as construction continues and additional costs are incurred  this guarantee will increase accordingly 
at december   we had a liability recorded of approximately million related to the fair value of this guarantee 
after construction is complete  uprr will lease the building under an initial term of five years with provisions for renewal for an extended period subject to agreement between the railroad and lessor 
at any time during the lease  the railroad may  at its option  purchase the building at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to construct the building 
if the railroad elects not to purchase the building or renew the lease  the building is returned to the lessor for remarketing  and the railroad has guaranteed a residual value equal to of the total construction related costs 
the guarantee will be approximately million 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
we use swaps  collars  futures and or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and hedge the exposure to variable cash flows 
the use of these instruments also limits future gains from favorable movements 
we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the purpose of these programs is to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying item being hedged 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  we have not been required to provide collateral  nor have we received collateral relating to our hedging activities 
in addition  we enter into secured financings in which the debtor has pledged collateral 
the collateral is based upon the nature of the financing and the credit risk of the debtor 
we generally are not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral unless the debtor defaults 
determination of fair value the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december  and were determined based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable us treasury rate  london interbank offered rates libor or swap spread 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates or fuel prices could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 

table of contents interest rates we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
the mix of fixed and floating rate debt is largely managed through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as incremental borrowings are required 
derivatives are used as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt representing approximately and  respectively  of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in than our annual variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
the swaps have been accounted for using the short cut method as allowed by fasb statement no 
fas  therefore  no ineffectiveness has been recorded within our consolidated financial statements 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of debt with a maturity date of october in may  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of debt with a maturity date of february this swap contained a call option that matched the call option of the underlying hedged debt  as allowed by fas in january  the swap s counterparty exercised its option to cancel the swap  effective february  similarly  we exercised our option to redeem the underlying debt 
as of december  and  we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  the fair values of our fixed rate debt were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
fuel fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
as a result of the significance of fuel costs and the historical volatility of fuel prices  we periodically use swaps  collars  futures and or forward contracts  as well as our fuel surcharge programs  to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
as of december   collars are in place for of expected fuel consumption for the collars have a floor of  a cap of and a ceiling of per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
as of december   we had no outstanding hedges for based on annualized fuel consumption during  and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would have resulted in approximately million of additional fuel expense  after tax 
as of december   we hedged approximately of our forecasted fuel consumption using fuel swaps at per gallon  excluding taxes  transportation costs and regional pricing spreads 
accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb published a revision to fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin to clarify some of the provisions and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under the new guidance  special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin prior to issuance of the revised interpretation 
we adopted fin in june of the revision did not require us to modify our accounting related to the implementation of fin 
table of contents network performance our network performance and operating efficiency were adversely affected in the third and fourth quarters by a shortage of trainmen and engineers  combined with an expanded summer track maintenance program and fourth quarter record level volumes 
additional operating expenses were incurred as crew utilization costs and car cycle times increased due to slower network train speed 
as discussed under operating expenses in this item  labor  rent expense and other costs were affected by our network performance 
programs have been put in place  which we believe should remedy the situation  including  among other things  hiring and training additional employees and accelerating certain locomotive acquisitions 
commitments and contingencies there are various claims and lawsuits pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries
