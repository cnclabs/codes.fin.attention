the company s continuation as a going concern was dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required  and ultimately to attain successful operations 
during this period  as a result of competitive pressure  one of the trade lane s largest participant filed bankruptcy and after operating in bankruptcy for approximately months sold its vessel assets to another competitor in the trade 
with a realignment of capacity and demand in the trade lane  resulted in a redistribution of freight volume among the remaining four participants which resulted in increased volume and capacity utilization to the company 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to implement increases in customer rates and surcharges 
in addition to the revenue increases  the company also implemented several changes to reduce cost

other barriers to entry include limited port space in san juan 
both act as major constraints to the addition of new capacity 
the company believes that its capacity utilization and rate levels can be maintained

the company expects this to continue through the upcoming years resulting in a stable trade environment

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period  commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvages values for purposes of depreciating its property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations 
in  page the company recorded an impairment charge on the company s tbc barges amounting to approximately million 
there were no impairments in or uncollectible accounts 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts 
the company also takes into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends 
the company s process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers  including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions 
the company continually reviews historical trends and makes adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts from to resulted primarily from improved market condition with respect to the puerto rico trade 
income taxes 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  if it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the company s history of unprofitable operations  the company has not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
the company currently provides for income taxes only to the extent that it expects to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes for current income 
it is possible  however  that the company could operate in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset  including deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nol 
upon reaching such a conclusion  the company would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to its combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with less management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
