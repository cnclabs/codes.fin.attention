item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iridex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of semiconductor based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin conditions in dermatology aesthetics 
our products are sold in the united states predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally through independent distributors into countries 
total product sales in   and were million  million  and million respectively 
our revenues arise primarily from the sale of our iris medical oculight systems  diolite and apex systems  delivery devices  disposables and  to a lesser extent  revenues from service and support activities 
our current family of oculight systems includes the iris medical oculight symphony  oculight sl  oculight slx  oculight gl and oculight glx laser photocoagulation systems 
we also produce the millennium endolase module which is sold exclusively to bausch lomb and incorporated into their millennium microsurgical system 
we believe that future growth in unit sales will be derived from growth in sales of peripheral delivery devices and service revenue  our new product introductions  replacement of old laser instruments and technology and from the adoption of new less invasive procedures using our existing products  such as transpupillary thermotherapy 
sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit 
sales of our products internationally currently are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  are subject to risks associated with international monetary conditions and currency fluctuations 
in general  strengthening of the us dollar relative to a foreign currency increases the cost of our product to our customers 
other risks that international sales are subject to include shipping delays  generally longer receivable collection periods  changes in applicable regulatory policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  trade restrictions  duties and tariffs and economic and political instability 
future currency fluctuations or other factors discussed above may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
see factors that may affect future results we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing components and sub systems  assembling  packaging  shipping and testing components at our facility  and the direct labor and associated overhead 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  materials and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications which utilize our products 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facilities  legal and accounting  insurance and other expenses which are not allocated to other departments

international sales  which were of total sales  increased by to million in from million in international ophthalmology sales increased in by million while international dermatology sales remained at million 
we face challenges marketing and selling our products in the current difficult economic environment  both domestically and internationally  and expect to continue to face these challenges for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect future results our business has been adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in  sales increased by to million from million in primarily as a result of a million increase in domestic sales which was offset by a million decrease in international sales 
domestic sales  which represented of total sales  increased in by to million from million in which reflected a million increase in domestic ophthalmology sales and a 
million increase in domestic dermatology sales 
international sales  which were of total sales  decreased in by to million from million in due to a million decrease in international ophthalmology sales and a million decrease in international dermatology sales 
ophthalmology sales in  ophthalmology sales increased to million from million in domestic ophthalmology sales increased to million in from million in domestic ophthalmology sales increased during this period mainly as a result of million in increased unit sales of delivery devices  million in increased service revenue  million in increased unit sales of visible lasers and million in increased unit sales of infrared lasers 
international ophthalmology sales increased to million 
the increase in international sales was due primarily to a million increase in unit sales of visible laser consoles  million in increased service revenue  million in increased average selling prices and million in increased unit sales of delivery devices offset by a million decrease in unit sales of infrared laser consoles 
ophthalmology sales increased by to million in as compared to million in domestic ophthalmology sales increased to million 
domestic ophthalmology sales increased during this period mainly as a result of million in increased unit sales of visible laser consoles  including the millennium endolase module  million in increased unit sales of delivery devices and million in increased service revenue offset  in part  by a decrease in average selling prices of million 
international ophthalmology sales decreased by million or to million 
the decrease in international sales was due primarily to a million decrease in unit sales of infrared laser consoles  which resulted from the stronger us dollar in  offset by a million increase in combined unit sales of visible laser consoles and delivery devices 
dermatology sales dermatology sales decreased in to million from million in domestic dermatology sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in domestic dermatology sales was due primarily to a million in decreased unit sales of the diolite laser  
table of contents million in decreased average selling prices  million in decreased unit sales of the apex hair removal laser offset  in part  by million in increased service revenue 
international dermatology sales remained constant at million for and dermatology sales increased by to million in as compared to million in domestic dermatology sales increased to million 
the increase in domestic dermatology sales was due mainly to a million increase in unit sales of the apex laser system  a million increase in unit sales of delivery devices and million in increased service revenue offset  in part  by a million decrease in unit sales of the diolite laser and a decrease in average selling prices of million 
international dermatology sales decreased to million 
increases in international unit sales of the apex laser system of million and in delivery devices of million were offset by a million decrease in unit sales of the diolite gross profit 
gross profit was million in  million in and million in gross profit represented of sales in and and in in  a slight increase of in direct inventory costs was offset by the same level of decrease in overhead spending 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in by as compared to as a result of for inventory related charges  for increased warranty costs related to a change in estimate  for lower average selling prices offset  in part  by increased gross margin of associated with a reduction in direct inventory costs and for increased domestic sales which have a higher gross margin 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of components and thereby mitigate the impact of price reductions on our gross profit 
we believe gross profit in dollars will increase as volumes increase and unit production costs will decrease as costs are engineered out of new products 
in addition  as we evaluate gross margins on each of our product lines  we may choose to place greater focus on product lines with better margins 
overall  however  gross margins as a percentage of sales will continue to fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  the product mix of sales  costs associated with future product introductions and a variety of other factors 
see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by in to million from million in the decrease in  in absolute dollars  consisted of million in reduced personnel spending related to the reduction in force in june  million in decreased clinical spending and million in reduced occupancy spending associated with renegotiation of a lease  offset by million in increased project spending 
in research and development expenses decreased to million from million in the decrease in  in absolute dollars  consisted of million in reduced personnel spending related to a reduction in force in june  million in reduced spending due to the completion of the apex hair removal laser system in  offset  in part  by a million increase in clinical spending 
these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the decrease in research and development expenses in and  as a percentage of sales  was due to the decline in expenses in absolute dollars and an increase in the level of sales 
we expect to increase our research and development expenditures in absolute dollars in as we conduct additional development projects with our existing research and development staff 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense increased by in to million from million in in  sales general and administrative expense decreased by from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was driven primarily by million in increased non commission related selling activities and million in administrative spending associated primarily with increased consulting and insurance costs 
the decrease in 
table of contents consisted of reduced marketing and administrative personnel spending of million related  in part  to the reduction in force in june  million in reduced spending on marketing programs  million in reduced insurance spending and million of other cost containment actions targeted at non personnel expenses and resulting in reduced costs 
these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the increase  as a percentage of net sales  from to  was attributable to the increase in sales  general and administrative expense relative to the increase in the level of sales 
the decrease  as a percentage of net sales  from to  was due to the decrease in sales  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars and an increase in sales 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
this income was primarily from interest earned on available for sale securities 
interest income increased slightly in over but decreased for both years in comparison to as a result of lower interest rates in and and overall lower average cash balances in income taxes 
in  our effective rate was a benefit of and in it was a benefit of  primarily as a result  in both cases  of pretax income approaching breakeven and the level of tax credits for research and development activities relative to the loss for and our effective tax rate for was a benefit of 
the tax rate for was higher than the federal and state combined statutory rate of because of certain tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest on tax preferred securities and with tax credits for research and development activities 
discontinued operations 
in april  we discontinued our laser research segment 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a loss of million net of a million tax benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the loss on discontinued operations to million net of a million income tax benefit 
there were no revenues  costs or expenses for the laser research segment in  or sales  general and administrative costs and indirect costs of manufacturing historically were not allocated to the laser research segment 
the laser research segment conducted research and development under research grants from the us federal government and others 
we discontinued our laser research activities to better focus available resources on our medical applications and products 
the assets of the segment  primarily inventory  were fully reserved and the liabilities were fully paid 
the components of the recorded loss were inventory costs of million  the loss on operations for the first quarter of of million  estimated sales return costs of million  estimated costs for the phase out period of million and purchase order commitments of million offset by a tax benefit of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the accrued loss for the discontinuation of the segment was adjusted to reflect fewer than anticipated product returns 
reduction in force 
during the quarter ended june   we reduced our workforce by seventeen positions or approximately 
for the three months ended june   we recorded restructuring charges totaling approximately  that were related primarily to the severance costs associated with the headcount reduction instituted in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources at january   our primary sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and available for sale securities of million  for a total of million 
in addition  we have available million under our unsecured line of credit which bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires in october as of january   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 

table of contents we expect to renew the line of credit in october assuming that terms continue to be acceptable 
we believe that  based on current estimates  our current cash  available for sale securities and the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant competitive factor in our industry  and accordingly we may choose to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing prior to the end of net cash generated by operations in totaled million as compared with million generated in operations in and million used in operations in in  sources of cash included decreases in net inventories of million  decreases in net accounts receivable of million  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  and net income of million 
uses of cash in included an increase in the deferred tax asset of million and decreases in prepaid expenses of million 
the decrease in inventory was due mainly to an ongoing inventory reduction program 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to increased collection efforts 
the increase in accrued expenses consisted mainly of million for income tax payable and million for deferred revenue 
in  sources of cash included decreases in net inventories of million  depreciation of million  increases in accrued expenses of million  decreases in prepaid expenses of million and net income of million 
uses of cash in included decreases in accounts payable of million  increases in net accounts receivable of million and an increase in the deferred tax asset of million 
the decrease in inventory and accounts payable was due mainly to implementation of an inventory reduction program 
the increase in accrued expenses consisted mainly of million for income tax payable  million for an increase in accrued warranty and million for an accrued liability 
the decrease in prepaid expenses consisted primarily of million for tax receivable 
in  uses of cash included increases in net inventories of million  a net loss of million  increases in deferred income taxes of million  decreases in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million  decreases in net accounts receivable of million offset by sources of cash from operations which included depreciation of million  tax benefit of employee stock option plans of million and decreases in prepaids and other current assets of million 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to material purchases associated with the apex which commenced shipment in july the increase in deferred income taxes was due primarily to the tax loss generated in the decrease in accrued expenses resulted primarily from a decrease in accrued payroll 
the decrease in accounts payable related to a decreased level of inventory receipts at the end of the year 
prepaid and other current assets decreased due to decreases in accounts payable of million and to decreased prepaid spending on trade shows 
in  we used million for investing activities 
we generated million for investing activities in in  we used million of cash 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale or purchase and proceeds of available for sale securities and the acquisition of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively  which consisted primarily of issuance of stock in connection with our employee stock programs  offset in part by purchase of treasury stock of million in in december  we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to  shares of our common stock may be repurchased in the open market 
we plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with employee stock programs 
no shares of our common stock from the open market were purchased during and in  we purchased  shares of our common stock 
table of contents from the open market 
as of january   we have repurchased  shares of common stock under this program 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is deemed probable 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
deferred revenue relating to warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract 
cost is recognized as incurred 
up front fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments 
warranty the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
warranty costs are reflected in the income statement as a cost of revenues 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts in the process of preparing financial statements we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must estimate future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales returns amounted to million in similarly our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of january  
table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
income taxes deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
changes in estimate of future levels of taxable income or tax planning strategies could result in the need to provide or increase the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets which could materially impact earnings in the period of change 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes purchase commitments and minimum rentals due for our facility and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases as of january  in thousands payments due by period and total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations contractual purchase obligations have varying cancellation terms 

table of contents factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently market visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser systems to the ophthalmic market 
we also market visible and infrared light semiconductor based photocoagulator medical laser systems to the dermatology market 
we believe that continued and increased sales  if any  of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following product performance  features  ease of use  scalability and durability  recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists  dermatologists  clinicians  plastic surgeons and their associated opinion leaders  price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies  availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments  
table of contents willingness of ophthalmologists and dermatologists to convert to semiconductor based or infrared laser systems from alternative technologies  and level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products 
in addition  we derive a meaningful portion of our revenues from the sale of delivery devices 
our ability to increase revenues from the sale of delivery devices will depend primarily upon the features  ease of use and prices of our products  including relative to the prices of competing delivery devices 
the level of service revenues will depend on our quality of care  responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to request our services rather than purchase competing products or services 
any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues derived from the sales of laser consoles  delivery devices or services would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic and dermatology treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are lumenis ltd  carl zeiss  inc  alcon  quantel and nidek  inc all of these companies currently offer a competitive semiconductor based laser system in ophthalmology 
our principal competitors in dermatology are laserscope  candela corporation  palomar technologies  lumenis ltd 
and cutera  inc some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than we do and long standing customer relationships 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators  we compete with pharmaceuticals  such as visudyne which is marketed by qlt  inc novartis pharma ag  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
some medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies that are more effective in treating conditions targeted by us or are less expensive than our current or future products 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and new applications 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
in june we began shipment of two new products  a micron slit lamp adaptor and a gauge single use endoprobe 
in october  we announced the introduction of a number of new products  specifically the oculight symphony multi wavelength laser delivery system  an expanded endoprobe product line and a mm large spot slit lamp adapter 
we also announced the millennium endolase module in  which we manufacture to be included in bausch lomb s millennium microsurgical system 
successful commercialization of these and other new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers 
in addition  we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables 
these variables include price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve 
table of contents market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline 
our business has been adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
the overall weak economic conditions worldwide have resulted in reduced demand for some of our products  particularly demand for our dermatology products 
political and social turmoil in various parts of the world or terrorist acts may adversely impact global economic conditions 
these political  social and economic conditions and related economic uncertainties make it difficult for us  our customers and our distributors to forecast orders and sales of our products and  accordingly  plan future business activities 
this level of uncertainty strongly challenges our ability to operate profitably or grow our business 
if economic or market conditions do not improve  this may have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have experienced declines in the average unit price of our products and expect to continue to suffer from declines in the future 
the average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
further  should average unit prices of our current products decline  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins  our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales 
we face risks of manufacturing 
the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
we assemble critical subassemblies and all of our final products at our facility in mountain view  california 
we may experience manufacturing difficulties  quality control issues or assembly constraints  particularly with regard to new products that we may introduce 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products  which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products 
we do not currently intend to utilize any external manufacturers for our products 
furthermore  we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations and  as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues 
we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  including optics  laser diodes and crystals 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis 
some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited source 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including the following unavailability of  shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require  delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require  failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications  and potentially reduced quality  and 
table of contents inability to obtain components at acceptable prices 
our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components 
the process of qualifying suppliers is complex  requiring extensive testing with our products  and may be lengthy  particularly as new products are introduced 
new suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under fda and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines  which may delay sales and increase product costs 
any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction  materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
we do not currently intend to manufacture any of these components 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue from international sales 
in  and  our international sales were million  million and million  or  and  respectively  of total sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
none of our international revenues and costs has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
the factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks including longer accounts receivable collection periods  impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  foreign certification requirements  including continued ability to use the ce mark in europe  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  and multiple protectionist  adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations 
any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for additional discussion about our foreign currency risks  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we depend on sales of our ophthalmology products for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue and profits from sales of our ophthalmology products 
in  and sales of our ophthalmology products were million  million and million or  and  respectively of total sales 
we 
table of contents anticipate that sales of our ophthalmology products will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future as we continue to introduce new ophthalmology products  such as the micron slit lamp adapter and our expanded endoprobe product line  and support clinical trials in the field of ophthalmology  including the tttcnv clinical trial for the treatment of wet amd 
our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
in addition  third party payers may not initiate coverage of new procedures using our products for a significant period 
in september  the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  advised that claims for reimbursement for certain age related macular degeneration amd procedures which use our oculight slx laser system  could be submitted for reimbursement  with coverage and payment to be determined by the local medical carriers at their discretion 
to date five carriers representing states have written reimbursement coverage policies on ttt 
the states reimbursing for ttt are alaska  arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  iowa  idaho  mississippi  north carolina  north dakota  nevada  oregon  pennsylvania  south dakota  tennessee  washington and wyoming 
domestic sales of the oculight slx laser system may continue to be limited until more local medical carriers reimburse for performing such amd procedures or until cms advises that claims for these procedures may be submitted directly to cms at the national level 
changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
our success will depend in part on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 
clinical trials are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
we are currently supporting several ongoing clinical trials  including  for example  the tttcnv clinical trial 
the tttcnv clinical trial is a multi center  prospective  double masked  placebo controlled  randomized trial conducted at centers in the united states 
we believe this clinical trial is a post marketing study performed within the fda cleared indications of the oculight slx and is being conducted to determine whether ttt laser treatment using our oculight slx infrared laser system and large spot slit lamp adapter can reduce the risk of vision loss for patients with wet amd compared to a randomized control  which should reflect the natural history of the disease 
we believe that a favorable outcome from the tttcnv clinical trial will increase laser sales although this process may take a number of years 
in march  we announced that the executive committee for the tttcnv clinical trial accepted the 
table of contents recommendations of the independent data and safety monitoring committee that an adequate number of patients were enrolled to detect a clinically relevant difference between outcomes in ttt treated eyes and patients not being treated 
in june  we announced the publication of two additional clinical studies  which also support the effectiveness of ttt for the treatment of wet age related macular degeneration 
both studies were prospective  non randomized  non masked case series that were performed using our oculight slx laser and large spot size slit lamp adapter 
we cannot assure you that results from the tttcnv clinical trial will prove to be successful 
if the future results of the tttcnv clinical trial or any other clinical trial regarding our products fails to demonstrate improved outcomes of treatments using our products  our ability to generate revenues from new products or new applications using our products would be adversely affected and our business would be harmed 
our operating result may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following general economic uncertainties and political concerns  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and new applications  changes in demand for our existing line of dermatology and ophthalmic products  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  including the ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned  fluctuations in our product mix between dermatology and ophthalmic products and foreign and domestic sales  the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  introduction of new products  product enhancements and new applications by our competitors  entry of new competitors into our markets  pricing pressures and other competitive factors  our long and highly variable sales cycle  decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products  changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of  among other things  reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products  and increased product development costs 
in addition to these factors  our quarterly results have been  and are expected to continue to be  affected by seasonal factors 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the 
table of contents shortfall of sales  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance 
our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we rely on our direct sales force and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenue depends upon our direct sales force within the united states and relationships with independent distributors outside the united states 
as of january  our direct sales force consisted of employees with open positions and we maintained relationships with independent distributors internationally selling our products into countries 
we generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control 
our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties 
if any distributor breaches or fails to generate sales of our products  we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
we may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  which may limit our revenues and our ability to maintain market share 
the loss of the services of these key personnel would harm our business 
similarly  our distributorship agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and distributors may terminate their relationships with us  which would affect our international sales and results of operations 
we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and development and clinical testing of our products 
we currently collaborate with bausch lomb to design and manufacture a solid state green wavelength nm laser photocoagulator module  called the millennium endolase module 
the millennium endolase module is designed to be a component of bausch lomb s ophthalmic surgical suite product offering and is not expected to be sold as a stand alone product 
sales of the millennium endolase module are dependent upon the actual order rate from and shipment rate to bausch lomb  which depends on the efforts of our partner and is beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with bausch lomb will result in further sales of our millennium endolase module 
our collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from collaborations with us or may not devote sufficient resources to the marketing and sale of such products 
our reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of our products may result in unforeseen problems 
further  our collaborative partners may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if a collaborator elects to terminate its agreement with us  our ability to develop  introduce  market and sell the product may be significantly impaired and we may be forced to discontinue altogether the product resulting from the collaboration 
we may not be able to negotiate alternative collaboration agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a 
table of contents combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued fourteen united states patents and two foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes 
we have approximately four pending patent applications in the united states and eight foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products 
moreover  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until the patents issued 
patent applications filed in the united states after november generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  both within the united states and with regards to international patent applications  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of  claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 
any claims  with or without merit  and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  would be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to government regulation which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
the medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by foreign and state governments 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the related regulations  the fda regulates the design  development  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the product must undergo rigorous testing and an extensive regulatory review process implemented by the fda under federal law 
unless otherwise exempt  a 
table of contents device manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval application pma process 
depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated  the fda process can take several years  require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions 
our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the fda imposes additional regulations on manufacturers of approved medical devices 
we are required to comply with the applicable quality system regulations and our manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before being utilized for commercial manufacturing 
noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
any of these actions by the fda would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  we are also subject to varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance with the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
while currently all of our released products are ce marked  continued certification is based on successful review of our quality system by our european registrar during their annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving fda approval or clearance 
a recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
a recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales 
if we modify one of our fda approved or cleared devices  we may need to seek new approvals or clearances which  if not granted  would prevent us from selling our modified products 
any modifications to an fda approved or cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a pma approval 
we may not be able to obtain additional k clearances or pma approvals for new products or for modifications to  or additional intended uses or indications for  our existing products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our revenue and future profitability 
we have made modifications to our devices and the labeling of our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals 
if the fda disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the 
table of contents modifications  we may be required to recall and stop marketing the modified devices  which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign or relabel our products 
if product liability claims are successfully asserted against us  we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims from time to time 
our products are highly complex and some are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
although we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  our coverage from our insurance policies may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive 
we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs 
we use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
if we overestimate the demand for our product  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
over the past several quarters  we have placed a high priority on our asset management efforts to  among other things  reduce overall inventory levels and increase our cash position 
if we underestimate demand for our product and  consequently  our component and materials requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing  delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
if we fail to manage growth effectively  our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience growth in our business 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through  among other things  new product development and clinical trials for new applications and products 
we must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train  motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
all of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in mountain view  california 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available  and our ability to grow may be limited as a result 
we believe that our existing cash balances  available for sale securities  credit facilities and cash flow expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the development and marketing of new products and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
if cash from available sources is insufficient  we may need 
table of contents additional capital  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
any inability to raise additional capital when we require it would seriously harm our business 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements  changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions 
we receive only limited attention by securities analysts and may experience an imbalance between supply and demand for our common stock resulting from low trading volumes 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme volatility in the last few years that has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have no long term debt as of january  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not extend beyond fiscal year and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio 
management evaluates its financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 

table of contents we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure related to currency rate movements would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
