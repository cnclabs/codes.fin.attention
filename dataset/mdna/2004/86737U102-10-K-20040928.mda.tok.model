corporate business strategy in fiscal  we redirected our business strategy toward the operation of community hospitals in the united states 
on february   sunlink purchased five community hospitals  leasehold rights for a sixth existing hospital and the related businesses of all six hospitals for approximately  on october   we sold all of the capital stock of what was then our wholly owned united kingdom housewares subsidiary  beldray limited  and we no longer own any operating businesses outside the united states 
in august  we changed our name to sunlink health systems  inc from krug international corp  and changed our fiscal year end from march to june on october   we acquired two additional hospitals through our acquisition of healthmont  inc in june  we sold our mountainside medical center mountainside  a bed hospital located in jasper  ga for approximately  through our subsidiaries  we currently operate a total of seven community hospitals in four states 
currently six of the hospitals are owned and one is leased 
critical accounting policies and estimates in january  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve reserves for adjustments to net patient service revenues  evaluation of the recoverability of assets  including accounts receivable  and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes and related tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities relating to discontinued operations  all as discussed in more detail in the remainder of this subsection 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
net patient service revenues we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from established charges 
payment arrangements vary and include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
our patient service revenues are reported as services are rendered at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others 
estimated net realizable amounts are estimated based upon contracts with third party payers  published reimbursement rates and historical reimbursements percentages pertaining to each payor type 
estimated reductions in revenues to reflect agreements with third party payors and estimated retroactive adjustments under such reimbursement agreements are accrued during the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as interim and final settlements are determined 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for 
index to financial statements services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to accrue such revenue deductions 
at june   there were no material claims or disputes with third party payors 
during the fiscal year ended june   there were no material settlements with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of sunlink s receivables result from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts estimated to become uncollectible in the future 
the company calculates an allowance percentage based generally upon its historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying allowance percentages to receivable amounts included in specific payor categories 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
risk management we are exposed to various risks of loss from medical malpractice and other claims and casualties  theft of  damage to  and destruction of assets  business interruption  errors and omissions  employee injuries and illnesses  natural disasters including earthquakes  and employee health  dental and accident benefits 
commercial insurance coverage is purchased for a portion of claims arising from such matters 
when  in our judgment  claims are sufficiently identified  a liability is accrued for estimated costs and losses under such claims 
in connection with the acquisition of the original six hospitals  we assumed responsibility for professional liability claims reported after the february  acquisition date and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims prior to the acquisition date 
we purchased claims made commercial insurance for acts prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february   and for claims incurred after february  these amounts are based on actuarially determined amounts 
on june  sunlink sold mountainside medical center  one of its initial six hospitals  but retained all liabilities and obligations arising from the company s operations prior to closing and purchased a year  claims made  extended discovery period tail policy for professional liability 
by virtue of our acquisition of healthmont and its two hospitals  we assumed responsibility for all professional liability claims for which healthmont was  or is  liable 
healthmont had purchased claims made commercial insurance for claims made prior to our acquisition and we have purchased claims made commercial insurance for claims made after the acquisition 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of liability for claims assumed at the acquisition and for claims incurred after the acquisition 
these amounts are based on actuarially determined amounts 
we self insure for workers compensation and employee health risks 
the estimated liability for workers compensation and employee health risks includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we accrue an estimate of losses resulting from workers compensation  employee health and professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
these accruals are estimated quarterly based upon management s review of claims reported and historical loss data 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation if it is probable a loss has been incurred and accrue the most likely amount of loss based the information available 
if no amount within the range of losses estimated from the information available is more likely than any other amount in the range of loss  the minimum amount in the range of loss is accrued 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
we are exposed to various risks of loss from medical malpractice and other claims and casualties  theft of  damage to  and destruction of assets  business interruption  errors and omissions  employee injuries and illnesses  natural disasters including earthquakes  and employee health  dental and accident benefits 
commercial insurance coverage is purchased for a portion of claims arising from such matters 
when  in our judgment  claims are sufficiently identified  we accrue a liability for estimated costs and losses under such claims 

index to financial statements in connection with the acquisition of healthmont  sunlink secured a claims made  extended discovery period tail policy with respect to healthmont s existing director  officers and employment practices liability insurance policy for a term through august  because sunlink assumed responsibility for existing general and professional liability claims and claims reported after the acquisition date 
goodwill and other intangibles sunlink accounts for goodwill and intangible assets from business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased 
sfas no 
recognizes that goodwill has an indefinite life and is not subject to periodic amortization 
however  goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  using a fair value methodology  in lieu of amortization 
definite lived intangible assets  such as certificates of need  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from to years 
sunlink continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of intangible assets and they are tested for impairment as conditions warrant according to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences 
sfas no 
generally requires consideration of all expected future events other than proposed enactments of changes in the income tax law or rates 
when management determines  using factors identified in sfas no 
 that it is more likely than not that a portion or none of the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies  management provides a valuation allowance for the portion not expected to be realized 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for share options issued to employees using the intrinsic value based method of accounting 
financial summary the results of continuing operations shown in the historical summary below are of our us community hospital operations which is composed of five facilities acquired february  and the two healthmont facilities acquired october  the results of the disposed of mountainside medical center are included in the results of discontinued operations 
year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  net revenues cost of patient service revenues operating profit interest expense interest income loss on early repayment of debt merger expenses earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes admissions equivalent admissions surgeries revenue per equivalent admission equivalent admissions equivalent admissions is used by management and certain investors as a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying 
index to financial statements admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
the equivalent admissions computation is intended to relate outpatient revenues to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume to result in a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume equivalent admissions 
results of operations all of our net revenues are from our us community hospital segment 
the operations of sunlink s other business which were operated during these periods  the uk housewares and child safety products segments and our former mountainside medical center  are reported in discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions and the acquisition of the two healthmont facilities on october  excluding these two new healthmont facilities  net revenues increased from a increase in equivalent admissions  a increase in admissions and a increase in surgeries 
the two new healthmont facilities have lowered the net revenues per equivalent admissions in the current year as their operations have underperformed in comparison to the sunlink hospitals 
net outpatient service revenues increased  to  for the current year  but decreased to of net revenues from last year 
the decrease in net outpatient service revenues as a percentage of net revenues resulted from relatively lower outpatient revenues at the two new healthmont facilities 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions  a increase in revenue per admissions and a increase in surgeries 
net outpatient service revenues increased  to  for the year ended june  and they increased to of net revenues from in the year ended june  recruitment of new doctors and spending for capital improvements have contributed greatly to the increase in net revenues in the years ended june  and  respectively 
we added net new doctors during the year ended june  not including the doctors added in the healthmont acquisition and net new doctors during the year ended june  during the year ended june   sunlink spent  on physician guarantees and recruiting expenses compared to  for the same period last year 
we also have expended approximately  for capital expenditures to upgrade services and facilities since july  we believe the upgraded services and facilities and the new doctors contributed to the increase in net revenues  admissions  equivalent admissions and surgeries for the years ended june  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
we continue to seek increased patient volume by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  further upgrading the services offered by the hospitals and improving the hospitals physical facilities 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient revenues from various payors in the company s hospitals for the periods indicated years ended june  source medicare medicaid self pay commercial insurance other 
index to financial statements during the fiscal year ended june   sunlink has experienced an increase in medicaid and self pay revenues as a percentage of net revenues and an offsetting decrease in medicare revenues  due primarily to the patient mix of the two acquired healthmont hospitals 
net revenues for the year ended june  included  from a state indigent care program 
one facility began participation in this program this fiscal year and recorded deductions to net revenues for indigent care of  in the year ended june  cost of patient services revenues  including depreciation  were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cost of patient service revenues as of net revenues year ended june  salaries  wages and benefits provision for bad debts supplies purchased services other operating expenses rent and lease expense salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june   primarily due to higher contract labor and employee health insurance claims 
contract labor has increased due to higher contract labor costs at the healthmont hospitals and increased nursing contract labor at certain hospitals near larger metropolitan areas 
the provision for bad debts was of net revenues in the year ended june   a decrease of of net revenues from the prior year 
the decrease resulted from reclassifying approximately  of uncollectible indigent care net revenues from bad debt expense to a reduction of net revenue required by participation by one hospital in a state s indigent care program 
without this reclassification  bad debt expense would have been of net revenues for the year ended june   or an increase of of net revenues in the current year 
the increase was due to more difficult collection of deductibles and co insurance payments due to the overall decline in economic conditions and a higher percentage of self pay net revenues at one of the acquired healthmont facilities 
the increase in other operating expenses as a percent of net revenues reflects increases in insurance and physician recruiting expenses 
insurance expense increased by  in the year ended june  and physician recruiting expense increased by  as compared to the same period in salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased in the year ended june  as a percentage of net revenues due to the increased net revenues as a result of more efficient labor utilization 
the provision for bad debts was of net revenues in the year ended june   a decrease of of net revenues from the prior year 
the decrease resulted from decreased self pay and commercial payors net revenues and increased medicaid net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues 
we expensed previously capitalized costs of during the year ended june  relating to the acquisition of healthmont 
such costs were expensed in the second fiscal quarter of because at that time sunlink could not determine that it was probable that the healthmont merger would be completed 
subsequent to that time  an amended merger agreement was executed such that thereafter we believed it was probable that the merger would be completed  accordingly no further merger costs were expensed 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal was due to increased debt owed for most of fiscal due to the approximately  of debt assumed or undertaken in connection with the healthmont acquisition and increased revolving advance borrowings under the sunlink credit facility during the year 
the decrease in fiscal was due to of interest capitalized for the hospital constructed in jasper  georgia and a reduction of interest expense of as a result of the reduction of the principal amounts of the senior subordinated notes which were issued in connection with the acquisition of sunlink s six initial hospitals in february in december 
index to financial statements  we reached agreement with the note holder to reduce the principal of the two notes retroactive to february  in settlement of working capital purchased with the acquisition of such hospitals 
in june  we repaid the senior subordinated note from the acquisition of our initial hospitals principal amount of  due january  the healthmont term note i principal amount of  due march  the term loan principal amount of  due june and borrowings under our  revolving credit facility  outstanding at payment date which had a expiration date of december  with proceeds from the sale of mountainside 
we also terminated such revolving credit facility 
the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of  the loss was composed of  of unamortized discount on the senior subordinated note  of penalty related to the early repayment of the term loan and of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments 
we recorded an income tax benefit of federal benefit and state tax expense for the year ended june  compared to an income tax expense of federal tax and state tax for the year ended june  the federal benefit resulted from adjusting the domestic deferred asset valuation allowance to reflect expected future tax benefits from the deferred tax asset that are more likely than not to be utilized in future periods 
for the year ended june  we recorded for state taxes 
we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at june  use of this net operating loss carryforward is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue code section as a result  not all of the net operating loss carry forward is available to offset federal taxable income in the current year and federal income tax expense results 
we have provided a valuation allowance for  of our  gross deferred tax asset the majority of which is the net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes as it is our assessment based upon the criteria identified in sfas no 
that it is currently more likely than not that only  of the gross deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
the loss from continuing operations was  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to earnings from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and a loss from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  
the loss in fiscal resulted primarily from the loss on the early repayment of debt of  and the increased interest expense which resulted from the increased debt assumed or undertaken in connection with the healthmont acquisition 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal resulted from increased net revenues which generated increased operating profit  and decreased interest expense 
the loss from continuing operations for the year ended june  resulted from operating profit of offset by interest expense of  and income tax expense of earnings from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  included  of after tax gain on the sale of mountainside medical center  reduced by  of loss from operations of mountainside prior to its disposition  of domestic pension items and of income tax expense 
loss from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  includes an asset impairment charge of  relating to the predecessor facility to the mountainside medical center  of earnings of mountainside  the income tax benefit related to a domestic capital loss carry back and for domestic pension expense 
earnings from discontinued operations of  for the year ended june  was comprised of earnings of mountainside of  earnings of on the sale of our former uk housewares subsidiary  beldray limited  an after tax loss of from domestic pension expense  and a gain on the sale of our investment in lts holdings of net earnings for the year ended june  were  per fully diluted share compared to net earnings of per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and net earnings of per fully diluted share for the year ended june  earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization 
we understand that certain industry analysts 
index to financial statements generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a company and its ability to service debt 
we believe an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations 
operating profit for the year and quarter ended june  is a follows year ended june  quarter ended june  sunlink hospitals ebitda hospitals healthmont hospitals ebitda hospitals corporate overhead costs depreciation and amortization operating profit the sunlink hospitals include the five remaining hospitals acquired in february and the healthmont hospitals refer to the two hospitals acquired in october liquidity and capital resources we used  of cash from operating activities during the year ended june  compared to  provided by operating activities during the comparable period last year 
cash was used in operations as a result from the loss from continuing operations of  increased patient receivables from higher volume and decreased accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from payment of healthmont accounts payable assumed at the acquisition date 
sunlink expended  and  for capital expenditures at our hospitals in continuing operations during the year ended june  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for new and replacement equipment 
we believe an attractive  up to date physical facility assists in recruiting quality staff and physicians  as well as attracting patients 
our primary source of liquidity currently is cash on hand of  at june  since june   we have paid approximately  for income taxes due for the year ended june  and  to reduce the healthmont revolving loan 
our current credit facilities include an  secured revolving loan agreement of which  was outstanding at june  and of which  was subsequently paid down in august relating to the two healthmont facilities which matures august   two mortgages totaling  at june  which are due august  and a note payable of  due august  the debt capacity under our revolving credit agreement  which is solely for our healthmont  subsidiary is limited and is subject to certain leverage tests 
at june   our healthmont subsidiary had no additional borrowing capacity 
the availability of borrowing under our healthmont revolving loan agreement is based upon  among other things  a borrowing base keyed to the level of the healthmont facilities receivables 
based upon our estimates  no additional borrowing capacity was available under the agreement at june  if the amount or quality of receivables is lower than expected  our borrowing capacity under such healthmont line of credit facility will also be lower  we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months 
as noted above  our primary current source of liquidity is the cash on hand of approximately  at june  we are currently negotiating a new credit facility with a third party lender which would 
index to financial statements repay the current credit facilities and provide additional cash for working capital  capital expenditure needs  and other corporate purposes 
we currently expect the new credit facility to consist of a revolving loan facility and one or more term loans and to have maximum availability of up to  of which up to  is expected to be available for hospital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
we expect the new facility to be entered in october contractual obligations related to long term debt  non cancelable operating leases and physician guarantees at june  were as follows contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies payments due in long term debt operating leases physician guarantees year years years years years more than years at june   sunlink had contracts with physicians which contain guaranteed minimum gross receipts 
the table above shows the maximum obligation sunlink had at june  for physician guarantees 
sunlink expenses physician guarantees as they are determined to be due to the physician on an accrual basis 
each month  the physician s gross receipts are accumulated and the difference between the monthly guarantee and the physician s actual gross receipts for the month is calculated 
if the guarantee is greater than the receipts  the difference is accrued as a liability and an expense 
the net guarantee amount is paid to the physician in the succeeding month 
if the physician s monthly receipts exceed the guarantee amount in subsequent months  then the overage is repaid to sunlink to the extent of any prior monthly guarantee payments and the liability and expense is reduced by the amount of the repayment 
sunlink expensed   and for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  for physician guarantees 
at june   we had outstanding long term debt of  of which  was incurred in connection with the healthmont acquisition in october and of capital lease obligations 
in june  we sold our mountainside medical center for approximately  and repaid debt totaling approximately  including  of mountainside debt and substantially reduced the company s leverage 
the borrowing capacity under the healthmont loan facility of approximately  could be adversely affected by  among other things  decreases in hospitals receivables due to lower demand for our services by patients  change in patient mix  and changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services 
there is no current availability under the healthmont loan facility 
cash generated from operations could be adversely affected by  among other things  lower patient demand for our services  higher operating costs including  but not limited to  salaries  wages and benefits  provisions for bad debts  general liability and other insurance costs  cost of pharmaceutical drugs  and other operating expenses or by changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services  and the regulatory environment for community hospitals 
additional contingent obligations  other than with respect to our existing operations  include potential product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of our discontinued industrial segment in fiscal and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual at june  related to a portion of the guarantee by one of our uk subsidiaries of a lease covering a portion of a manufacturing facility utilized by our former uk housewares operations 
we are currently in the 
index to financial statements process of liquidating two dormant subsidiaries in germany and france 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to these liquidations 
our primary operational strategy is to improve the profitability of our hospitals by reducing out migration of patients  recruiting physicians  expanding services and implementing and maintaining effective cost controls 
our efforts are focused on internal growth 
however  we actively seek to supplement internal growth through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is to selectively acquire community hospitals with net revenues of approximately  or more which are the sole or primary hospital in market areas with a population of greater than  or a principal healthcare provider with substantial market share in communities with a population of  to  we believe all of our seven existing hospitals meet at least one of these two market area criteria 
the company considers recent prices paid by others for certain hospital acquisitions to be higher than we would seek to pay but believes there may be opportunities for acquisitions of individual hospitals particularly not for profit hospitals in the future due to  among other things  negative trends in certain government reimbursement programs and other factors 
beldray limited beldray limited beldray  sunlink s uk housewares subsidiary  was sold on october  for nominal consideration 
a guarantee given by an inactive uk subsidiary of sunlink with respect of beldray s obligations under a lease covering a portion of beldray s manufacturing location was entered into when beldray was owned by sunlink s uk subsidiary 
the maximum potential obligation of sunlink s uk subsidiary under the guarantee would be approximately  the uk subsidiary of sunlink is currently inactive and it has an option to repurchase the capital stock of beldray for nominal consideration if any uk subsidiary of sunlink is called upon to perform under the lease guarantee and under certain other conditions 
in september  the company was notified that beldray had been placed into receivership and is under the administration of its primary lender 
the company has not been notified by the landlord of beldray s manufacturing facility of any default by beldray under the lease which sunlink s uk subsidiary has guaranteed

related party transactions a director of the company and our company secretary who was a director of sunlink until november and is now director emeritus are members of two different law firms  each of whom provide services to sunlink 
sunlink has paid an aggregate of to these law firms in the year ended june  another director received as fees for being a letter of credit obligor for up to of sunlink s revolving credit loans assumed in the healthmont acquisition 
on august   sunlink entered into a  standby bridge loan facility with a private investor fund  sunlink s chairman and ceo and one sunlink director 
the facility had a day commitment period during which the loan could have been borrowed 
the facility also had a standby commitment fee which was fully earned on the commitment date and was non refundable 
the standby commitment fee was paid in september the standby bridge loan was entered into by sunlink for short term financing requirements due to the bankruptcy in august of its revolving line of credit facility lenders 
the day commitment period passed without any borrowing made under the standby facility 
inflation during periods of inflation and labor shortages  employee wages increase and suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices for their supplies and services 
we have not always been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices for our services and products or by implementing cost control measures 
we are unable to predict our ability to control future cost increases or offset future cost increases by passing along the increased cost to customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of borrowings under the healthmont revolving credit facility and the two mortgages assumed in the healthmont acquisition 
borrowings of  were outstanding under these agreements at june  a one percent change in the prime rate would result in a change in interest expense of on an annual basis 
no action has been taken to cover interest rate market risk and we are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities
