the company s combined telephonic and online revenue growth of and during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  was due to an increase in order volume resulting from i the company s strong brand name recognition  ii continued leveraging of its existing customer base  and iii the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts to enhance revenue growth in our floral gift category and in complimentary categories  including gourmet food gifts  such as the popcorn factory line of products acquired in may  gift baskets  candy and children s gifts 
this growth was offset  in part by  slower sales in the home and garden gift product line as a result of internal marketing and merchandising issues  as well as increasingly competitive market conditions 
the company has completed a review of this product line and has begun to implement a marketing plan to enhance product offerings  and the creative look and feel of its catalogs and website 
the company fulfilled approximately   and  orders through its combined telephonic and online sales channels during the fiscal years ended june   june   and june   respectively  representing increases of and over the respective prior fiscal years 
the growth resulted primarily from increases in online order volume  which increased and  during the years ended june  and june   respectively  in comparison to prior years  driven by improved conversion of qualified traffic through the company s web sites  and through third party portals  search engines and affiliates  and the continued migration of customers from the company s telephonic sales channel

the company s online sales channel contributed  and of the total combined telephonic and online revenues during the fiscal years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the company intends to continue to drive revenue growth through its online sales channel and continue the migration of its customers from the telephone to the web for several important reasons i online orders are less expensive to process than telephonic orders  ii online customers can view the company s full range of gift offerings  including non floral gifts  which yield higher gross margin opportunities  iii online customers can utilize all of the company s services  such as the various gift search functions  order status check and reminder service  thereby deepening the relationship with its customers and leading to increased order rates  and iv when customers visit the company online  it provides an opportunity to interact with customers in an electronic dialog via cost efficient marketing programs 
in order to improve overall demand  in response to forecasted economic conditions and analysis of consumer buying patterns within the company s available product offerings  during the fiscal year ended june   the company reallocated its marketing spending  reducing the circulation of certain home and garden gift product catalogs and redirecting those funds to various online and media programs featuring floral gifts 
as a result  during the fiscal year ended june   non floral gift products accounted for of total combined telephonic and online net revenues  compared to and during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
the increase in the percentage of non floral gift products sold during the fiscal year ended june  resulted from the expansion of candy  gift basket and gourmet foods  including the popcorn factory line in may in the future  the company will continue to emphasize appropriate products and categories to match consumer preferences and economic conditions

additionally  cost of revenues include labor and facility costs related to direct to consumer merchandise production operations  as well as facility costs on properties that are sublet to the company s franchisees 
gross profit increased during the fiscal years ended june  and june  as a result of increased order volume  and in fiscal  as a result of an improved gross margin percentage 
during the fiscal year ended june  gross margin percentage declined by basis points over the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of product mix  specifically  lower sales of home decor and garden merchandise which generate higher gross margins in comparison to the company s floral merchandise 
gross margin percentage during the fiscal year ended june  increased over the comparative prior year due to several factors including i increased non floral product sales  which were further complemented by the acquisition of the popcorn factory product line in may which earns higher gross margins  ii improvements in product shipping costs  inventory management and product sourcing  iii increases in the company s service charge  to align it with industry norms  and iv the company s continued focus on customer service  whereby stricter control standards and enforcement methods reduced the rate of product credits returns and replacements 
as the company implements its plans to restore sustainable growth in its home and garden gift line  the company expects that over the longer term it will continue to grow its higher margin  non floral business

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by online  telephonic and retail fulfillment operations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets
