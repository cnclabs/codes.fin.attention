through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the bank s board of directors reviews the bank s interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis 
the bank s asset liability committee is comprised of the bank s entire board of directors and members of senior management 
the committee is responsible for reviewing the bank s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the bank s net interest margin  the market value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in the interest rates will have on the bank s portfolio and the bank s exposure limits 
in recent years  the bank has emphasized the origination  purchase and retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans and shorter term fixed rate mortgage loans  consumer loans consisting primarily of home equity lines of credit and short term commercial business loans to strategically manage interest rate risk 
the bank currently does not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
in the event of sharply rising interest rates  the bank has  with retention in mind  competitively priced deposits 
during  the bank focused on attracting money market accounts as well as time deposits 
as necessary  the bank has offered competitive special products to increase retention 
historically  the bank has retained significant levels of maturing time deposits based on the above practice  as well as effective customer service and long standing relationships with customers 
for the year ended december   the bank retained of funds maturing from time deposits 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the bank for the years ended december   and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are derived from average monthly balances 
the yields and costs include fees that are considered adjustments to yields 
tax exempt income has been calculated on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate 
interest income attributed to the tax adjustment totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the growth in total assets was funded by increases in deposits and borrowed money 
deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in deposits is largely due to increased advertising and two new branch offices 
borrowed money  primarily representing fhlb advances  increased million to million at december  from million at december  stockholders equity increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of the company s net income during the year  which was partially offset by a  decrease in the company s accumulated other comprehensive income relating to its available for sale investment portfolio  stock repurchases totaling million and dividends paid of million 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
the company s net income increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets offset by a decrease in average yield 
the largest component was an increase of million in other loan interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million  offset by a decrease in average yield of basis points 
another component was an increase of  in investment securities and interest bearing deposits interest income for the year ended december  this resulted from an increase in average balance of million offset by a decrease in average yield of basis points 
this was partially offset by a decrease of  in mortgage loan interest income 
this resulted from an increase in average balance of million offset by a decrease in average yield of basis points 
overall  the average yield on the bank s interest earning assets decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in average yield is due to a general decline in interest rates 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  the effect of which was offset by an overall decrease in the average rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on total deposits decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the average balance of deposits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the resulting decrease in interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  interest expense resulting from borrowed money increased by  the average rate paid on borrowed money decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in average rate was offset by an increase of million in the average balance of borrowed money to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to a million increase in average interest earning assets  at an average yield of  offset by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  at an average cost of

at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was compared to at december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
net charge offs totaled  in and there were no charge offs for the year ended december  management periodically calculates an allowance sufficiency analysis based upon the portfolio composition  asset classifications  loan to value ratios  impairments in the current loan portfolio  and other factors 
this analysis is designed to reflect credit losses for specifically identified loans  as well as credit losses in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the reserve methodology employed by management reflects the difference in degree of risk between the various categories of loans in the bank s portfolio 
the reserve methodology also critically assesses those loans adversely classified in the portfolio by management as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
these allowance components are set at a higher factor than the non classified one to four family loans in the portfolio to reflect the greater level of risk to which management believes the bank is exposed 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurance can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of management s control 
in addition  the fdic and the commissioner  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management noninterest income 
noninterest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
service fees increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in service fees increased primarily due to the offering of an overdraft privilege account to our customers

the efficiency ratio improved to for the year ended december  from for the comparable prior year period 
in addition  the noninterest expense to average total asset ratio decreased basis points to at december  from for the prior year period 
management continues to emphasize the importance of expense management and control in order to continue to provide expanded banking services to a growing market base

net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in average interest earning assets  at an average yield of  offset by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  at an average cost of 
this combination resulted in an increase in interest rate spread of basis points to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in interest rate spread is due to a general decrease in rates in the bank s local market area as well as deposits repricing faster than loans 
the net interest margin as a percent of interest earning assets increased by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in provision for loan losses 
the bank s provision for loan losses increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  in this increase is primarily due to the increased risk in the loan portfolio based on uncertain economic conditions and a greater emphasis placed on commercial lending

off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the bank s off balance sheet arrangements  see note concentrations of credit risk and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of the notes to consolidated statements found on page f contractual obligations and commercial commitments the bank has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments are at december  less than one year one to two years two to three years three to four years four to five years more than five years total december in thousands contractual obligations certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances operating leases total at december  at december  less than one year one to two years two to three years three to four years four to five years more than five years total december in thousands other commercial commitments lines of credit loan commitments letters of credit total at december  liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are savings deposits  proceeds from the principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from the maturation of securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from fhlb chicago 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary investing activities of the bank are the origination of primarily residential one to four family loans and  to a lesser extent  multi family and commercial real estate  construction and land  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities 
during the years ended december    and  the bank s loan originations totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the bank purchased loans totaling million  million and million for the same time periods 
primarily deposit growth  borrowings and principal repayments on loans  and mortgage backed securities funded these activities 
the bank experienced a net increase in total deposits of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
this increase can be attributed to an aggressive marketing campaign as well as the addition of a branch office 
in addition  borrowings increased million  decreased million and increased million  respectively for the same time periods 
the level of interest rates affects deposit flows  the interest rates and products offered by the local competitors and the bank  and other factors 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and interest bearing demand accounts 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and interest bearing demand accounts totaled million  or of total assets 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
on a longer term basis  the bank maintains a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under item to this annual report 
in the event the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had million of outstanding fhlb borrowings 
outstanding commitments to originate first mortgage loans totaled million at december  management of the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
for the year ended december   the bank experienced an retention rate of funds maturing from certificates of deposit 
it has been and will continue to be a priority of management to retain time deposits 
the bank relies primarily on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
from time to time  the bank will also offer competitive special products to its customers to increase retention 
based upon the bank s experience with deposit retention and current retention strategies  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a leverage capital level of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or of adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the capital injection resulting from the conversion in of million significantly increased liquidity and capital resources 
a portion of the net proceeds was invested in marketable securities 
the initial level of liquidity has been reduced as net proceeds are utilized for general corporate purposes  including the funding of lending activities and expansion of facilities and to a greater degree the repurchase of the company s common stock 
during  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock at an average price per share of 
the company believes that stock repurchases are a good way to manage its excess capital and a sound investment decision 
the primary source of funding for the company is dividend payments from the bank  sales and maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  earnings on investments and deposits held by the company 
dividend payments by the bank have primarily been used to fund stock repurchase programs and pay dividends on company stock 
these repurchases totaled million as of december  the bank s ability to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the company is generally limited by the provisions of the illinois state banking regulations and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
additionally  the illinois state banking commissioner and federal deposit insurance corporation may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulation for safety and soundness reasons 
under illinois banking law  an illinois state chartered stock savings bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits  unless there is an impairment of capital  but approval of the commissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed of the bank s net profits for that year if the bank has total capital of less than of total assets 
a savings bank may not declare dividends in excess of its net profits in any year without the approval of the commissioner 
to the extent the bank were to apply to pay a dividend or capital distribution to the company in excess of the regulatory permitted dividend amounts  no assurances can be made such application would be approved by the regulatory authorities 
see also regulation and supervision on page impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities which provides new accounting guidance on when to consolidate a variable interest entity 
a variable interest entity exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
those characteristics include the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected loss of an entity if they occur  and the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity if they occur 
on october   the fasb issued a deferral to december  of the implementation of fin for variable interest entities in existence prior to february  we do not expect that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued on january  we do not believe the implementation of fin r will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement would require that certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity be classified on the consolidated balance sheets as liabilities 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  on october   the fasb deferred the application of certain requirements of sfas no 
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb ratified a consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the consensus requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
these disclosures are contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a net portfolio value model which generates estimates of the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to the assumptions utilized for the gap table 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher the institution s sensitivity ratio  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the following npv table sets forth the bank s npv as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands static certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
due to the level of the current interest rate environment only a basis point decline is shown
