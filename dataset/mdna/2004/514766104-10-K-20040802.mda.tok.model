item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intelimer packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems in june that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications and beginning in november for personal care applications  and intellicoat coated inbred corn seeds in the fall of with the acquisition of apio in december and landec ag in september  the company is focused on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with landec ag s direct marketing  telephone sales and e commerce distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the judgements and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
notes and advances receivables apio has made advances to fruit growers for the development of orchards  and to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically  except for development advances  these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from harvested crops 
development advances and advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by perfected liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines the company may be unable to fully recoup its note or advance receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total note or advance receivable 
investments in farming activities investments in farming activities consist of cash advances to growers for expenses to be incurred during the growing season  in exchange for a percentage ownership in the proceeds of the crops 
net income or loss is generally recognized on these investments based on the company s percentage ownership of the net proceeds of the crops as fields are harvested and proceeds are settled 
these investments are periodically reviewed for impairment at least quarterly 
additionally  certain farming agreements contain provisions wherein the company bears the risk of loss if the net proceeds from the crops are not sufficient to cover the expense incurred 
if crop prices decline the company may be unable to fully recoup its investment and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total investment 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers and because the company carries foreign credit insurance to cover a portion of its foreign receivables exposure 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory considered to be useable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized over the period of the agreement to revenue when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
prior to november   the company recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of november   was reported as a charge in the year ended october  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the research and development period or supply period commitment of the agreement 
during the year ended october   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by approximately million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share  net of  of the related deferred revenue which was recognized as recycled revenue during per share 
during the fiscal year ended may  and for the seven months ended may   and for fiscal years ended october  and october      and  respectively  of the related deferred revenue was recognized as recycled revenue 
the remainder of the related deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue per fiscal year as follows  per year for through  and  for fiscal year contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  and is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company would likely be required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date no impairment losses have been incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no

twelve months ended may  compared to twelve months ended may  the twelve months ended may  amounts are unaudited and presented for comparative purposes only revenues in thousands fiscal year ended may  twelve months ended may  unaudited change apio value added   apio trading   apio bananas   apio service   total apio   landec ag   corporate  total revenues   apio value added apio s value added revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh cut and whole value added processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under apio s eat smart brand and the dole brand 
the increase in apio s value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same periods last year is due to increased product offerings  increased sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
specifically  sales of apio s value added ounce specialty packaged retail product line grew and sales of apio s value added vegetable tray products grew during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
overall value added sales volume increased during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
apio trading apio trading revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to asia through apio s export company  cal ex and from the purchase and sale of whole commodity fruit and vegetable products domestically to wal mart 
the export portion of trading revenues for fiscal year was million or of total trading revenues 
the increase in revenues in apio s trading business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to changes in the provisions of certain export contracts 
based on these revised contracts  the company now takes title to the products and therefore recognizes the revenue at its gross sales value rather than recording only the commission portion as revenue as it had done in the prior year before the changes in the provisions on certain of these contracts had been completed 
in addition  export sales volumes were higher by for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year 
apio bananas apio banana revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of bananas in our proprietary packaging 
during fiscal year  bananas have been sold almost exclusively to food service companies whereas in the prior year there were also product sales to retail grocery chains 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of bananas for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to the company not selling bananas to retail grocery stores in fiscal year resulting in a decrease in the unit volume of bananas sold 
this decrease was due to the company focusing on selling bananas to food service companies and developing alternative packaging formats during fiscal year during the fourth fiscal quarter of  apio began to transition from sourcing its own bananas to working with banana shippers who will package their bananas in landec s packaging and sell those packaged bananas to food service and retail customers 
apio service prior to its sale on june   apio operated a domestic commodity vegetable business that marketed and sold whole produce for growers 
apio charged a per carton service fee for marketing and selling these whole commodity products 
subsequent to june   apio s service revenues consist of revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a vegetable cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
the decrease in service revenues during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year is directly attributable to the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june  landec ag landec ag revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of hybrid seed corn to farmers under the fielder s choice direct brand and from the sale of intellicoat coated corn and soybean seeds to farmers and seed companies 
for the fiscal year ended may  and the twelve month period ended may   over of landec ag s revenues were from the sale of hybrid seed corn under the fielder s choice brand 
the increase in revenues at landec ag during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year is due to a change in product mix to higher priced hybrid corn varieties that resulted in a increase in the average price per unit 
corporate corporate revenues consist of revenues generated from partnering with others under research and development agreements and supply agreements and from fees for licensing our proprietary intelimer technology to others and from the corresponding royalties from these license agreements 
the decrease in corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in revenues from the million licensing agreement with ucb chemicals corporation ucb entered into in december which was recognized to revenue ratably over a month period through december and from the completion of the research and development agreement with a medical device company in june gross profit in thousands fiscal year ended may  twelve months ended may  unaudited change apio value added   apio trading   apio bananas apio service   total apio   landec ag   corporate  total gross profit   general there are numerous factors that can influence gross profits including product mix  customer mix  manufacturing costs raw materials  such as fresh produce  corn seed  polymer materials and packaging  labor and overhead  volume  sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory  to name a few 
many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors 
therefore  it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually 
the following discussion surrounding gross profits includes management s best estimates of the reasons for the changes for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the increase in gross profits for apio s value added specialty packaged vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to a increase in value added sales during fiscal year  product mix changes to higher margin products such as vegetable trays and improved manufacturing efficiencies through further automation of apio s production process 
these increases in gross profits were partially offset by produce shortages in late december and most of january which reduced gross profits by million 
apio trading apio s trading business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
the decrease in gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a sales mix change to lower margin fruit products from higher margin broccoli products 
apio bananas the decrease in gross profits for apio s banana business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to apio only selling bananas in its proprietary packaging to a few food service companies during fiscal year versus selling bananas to both food service companies and retail grocery chains in in addition  food service companies often do not purchase the entire container load of bananas that apio has had shipped from central america 
when this occurs  apio has to sell the remaining bananas on the open market at prices that do not cover its full costs and recognizes negative gross profits on the sale of those bananas 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  apio began to transition from sourcing its own bananas to working with banana shippers who will package their bananas in landec s packaging and sell those packaged bananas to food service and retail customers 
apio service the decrease in apio s service business gross profits during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was directly attributable to the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june  landec ag the increase in gross profits for landec ag for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to the increase in revenues  partially offset by higher royalty fees on corn seed hybrids with traits  such as genetics or certain chemicals  resulting in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
corporate the decrease in gross profits for corporate for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the million licensing agreement with ucb  which was entered into in december  being recognized to gross profits ratably over a month period through december and from the completion of the research and development agreement with a medical device company in june operating expenses in thousands fiscal year ended may  twelve months ended may  unaudited change research and development apio   landec ag   corporate   total r d   selling  general and administrative apio   landec ag   corporate   total s  g a   research and development landec s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses involved in the development and process scale up initiatives as well as legal fees associated with protecting landec s intellectual property patents  trademarks  etc research and developments efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breathable membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas 
at landec ag  the research and development efforts are focused on the company s proprietary intellicoat coatings for seeds  primarily corn seed 
at corporate  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food and agriculture 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower research and development expenses associated with the company s specialty packaging banana program as the focus of the program has shifted to market testing of the packaging technology and developing collaborative supply arrangements with banana shippers 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at apio as a result of the sale of apio s domestic commodity vegetable business on june  other in thousands fiscal year ended may  twelve months ended may  unaudited change interest income interest expense  minority interest expense other income total other expense  interest income the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to a reduction in interest bearing notes receivable at apio

minority interest expense the minority interest expense consists of the minority interest associated with the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp 
other other consists of non operating income and expenses such as the gain or loss on the sale of assets 
the increase in the net other expense for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in income recognized during fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
during the twelve months ended may   other income included a  gain from the sale of apio s fruit processing facility   in farm equipment rental income associated with the domestic commodity vegetable business sold in june and other miscellaneous credits

the high amount of cash generated from investing activities in the prior period was due to the sale of dock resins in october the primary uses of cash from investing activities in fiscal year were for the purchase of million of property and equipment 
in addition  million of restricted cash was released from the escrow pursuant to the dock resins stock purchase agreement and from the repayment of a capital lease obligation and became available for use as funds 
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended may  was million compared to million for the same period last year 
the cash was used to repay debt 
capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended may   landec purchased vegetable processing equipment and expanded its processing facility to support the growth of apio s value added business 
these expenditures represented the majority of the million of equipment purchased 
debt in august  apio entered into a new million working capital line and a million equipment line the lines with wells fargo business credit  inc wells fargo 
all amounts outstanding under apio s loan agreement with bank of america were paid off using the new wells fargo working capital line 
the term of the lines is three years expiring on july  during fiscal year  the interest rate was calculated based on the prime rate plus  or on an annual basis 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the interest rate is being calculated based on the prime rate plus  currently on an annual basis 
the lines contain restrictive covenants that require apio to meet certain financial tests including minimum levels of net income  minimum debt coverage ratio  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
apio was in compliance with all of the loan covenants throughout fiscal year the lines limit the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec if certain conditions  as defined in the agreements  are not met 
landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio to secure the lines 
as of may   million was outstanding under the lines 
landec ag has a revolving line of credit which allows for borrowings of up to million  based on landec ag s inventory levels 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is the prime rate plus  currently on an annual basis 
the line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict the ability of landec ag to make payments on debt owed by landec ag to landec 
landec ag was in compliance with all of the loan covenants throughout fiscal year landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of landec ag to secure the line of credit 
at may   no amounts were outstanding under landec ag s revolving line of credit

the amount of debt outstanding on the company s revolving lines of credit fluctuates over time 
borrowings on landec s lines of credit are expected to vary with seasonal requirements of the company s businesses 
in addition  in connection with landec s acquisition of apio  landec has remaining obligations to pay the former owners of apio million recorded at million on a discounted basis during the third quarter of fiscal year contractual obligations the company s material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of may   are as follows in thousands due in fiscal year ended may obligation total thereafter lines of credit   long term debt    capital leases operating leases  land leases  licensing obligation purchase commitments   total    landec is not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments listed above 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
additional factors that may affect future results landec desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  landec wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  landec s actual results and could cause landec s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of landec 
landec assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses which may continue we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception  except for the fiscal year ended may  and the seven month period ended may  our accumulated deficit as of may  totaled million 
we may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
our indebtedness could limit our financial and operating flexibility at may   our total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  was approximately million and the total debt to equity ratio was approximately 
of this debt  approximately million is comprised of revolving lines of credit and approximately million is comprised of term debt and capital lease obligations 
in august  apio entered into a new million working capital line and a million equipment line with wells fargo business credit  inc wells fargo 
all amounts outstanding under apio s previous line of credit with bank of america were paid off using the new wells fargo working capital line the credit facility 
the amount of debt outstanding under the apio and landec ag lines of credit fluctuate over time  and the agreements contain restrictive covenants that require each company to meet certain financial tests including maximum levels of net income  minimum debt coverage ratio  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
the credit facility limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec if certain conditions  as defined in the agreements  are not met 
landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio and landec ag to secure their bank debt 
of our non revolving debt  approximately million   and  become due over the next three fiscal years  respectively 
this level of indebtedness limits our financial and operating flexibility in the following ways a portion of net cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital is reduced  our ability to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  and our ability to react to changes in the industry and economic conditions generally may be limited 
in connection with the apio acquisition  we may be obligated to make future payments to the former shareholders of apio of up to million for the future supply of produce 
this amount is schedule to be paid during the third quarter of fiscal year our ability to service this indebtedness and these future payments will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to service this debt  we would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be successful and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
we have violated restrictions in our loan agreements and may have to pursue new financings if we are unable to comply with these provisions in the future apio is subject to various financial and operating covenants under the credit facility  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and minimum net income 
the credit facility limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec 
on april   apio was in technical violation of the minimum net worth covenant under its previous line of credit with bank of america 
subsequently  bank of america provided a written waiver of this violation as of april  all amounts outstanding under the line of credit with bank of america were paid off using the credit facility 
if we violate any obligations in the future we could trigger an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our obligation to repay the indebtedness due under the credit facility 
if the indebtedness due under the credit facility were accelerated  we would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  seeking new debt financing from another lender or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be achievable or available on attractive terms  if at all  and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate which may cause our stock price to decline in the past  our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
historically  our direct marketer of hybrid corn seed  landec ag  has been the primary source of these fluctuations  as its revenues and profits are concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in addition  apio can be heavily affected by seasonal and weather factors which have impacted quarterly results  such as the high cost of sourcing product in december and january due to a shortage of essential value added produce items which had to be purchased at inflated prices on the open market 
our earnings may also fluctuate based on our ability to collect accounts receivables from customers and note receivables from growers 
our earnings from our food products technology business are sensitive to price fluctuations in the fresh vegetables and fruits markets 
excess supplies can cause intense price competition 
other factors that affect our food and or agricultural operations include the seasonality of our supplies  our ability to process produce during critical harvest periods  the timing and effects of ripening  the degree of perishability  the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems  total worldwide industry volumes  the seasonality of consumer demand  foreign currency fluctuations  and foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
we may not be able to achieve acceptance of our new products in the marketplace our success in generating significant sales of our products will depend in part on the ability of us and our partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of our new products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  we achieve market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products is a function of many variables including  but not limited to price  safety  efficacy  reliability  conversion costs  marketing and sales efforts  and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or new products and technologies may not gain market acceptance 
we are in the early stage of product commercialization of certain intelimer based specialty packaging  intellicoat seed coating and other intelimer polymer products and many of our potential products are in development 
we believe that our future growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop and market new products in our target markets and in new markets 
in particular  we expect that our ability to compete effectively with existing food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commercializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing our products 
in addition  commercial applications of our temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
our failure to develop new products or the failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in the marketplace competitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
we operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of our collaborative arrangements may result in our corporate partners and licensees becoming our competitors 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we have a concentration of manufacturing in one location for apio and may have to depend on third parties to manufacture our products any disruptions in our primary manufacturing operation would reduce our ability to sell our products and would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  we may need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture our products 
if we become dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our products  our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver those products on a timely basis may be affected 
failures by third parties may impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and impair our competitive position 
we may not be able to continue to successfully operate our manufacturing operations at acceptable costs  with acceptable yields  and retain adequately trained personnel 
our dependence on single source suppliers and service providers may cause disruption in our operations should any supplier fail to deliver materials we may experience difficulty acquiring materials or services for the manufacture of our products or we may not be able to obtain substitute vendors 
we may not be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
several services that are provided to apio are obtained from a single provider 
several of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are currently purchased from a single source  including some monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for our breathable membrane products 
in addition  virtually all of the hybrid corn varieties sold by landec ag are grown under contract by a single seed producer 
any interruption of our relationship with single source suppliers or service providers could delay product shipments and materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we may receive notices from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming infringement by our products of patent and other proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  we could be required to alter our products or processes and our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any pending patent applications we file may not be approved and we may not be able to develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
any patents issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
patents held by others may prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
our operations are subject to regulations that directly impact our business our food packaging products are subject to regulation under the fdc act 
under the fdc act  any substance that when used as intended may reasonably be expected to become  directly or indirectly  a component or otherwise affect the characteristics of any food may be regulated as a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe 
we believe that food packaging materials are generally not considered food additives by the fda because these products are not expected to become components of food under their expected conditions of use 
we consider our breathable membrane product to be a food packaging material not subject to regulation or approval by the fda 
we have not received any communication from the fda concerning our breathable membrane product 
if the fda were to determine that our breathable membrane products are food additives  we may be required to submit a food additive petition for approval by the fda 
the food additive petition process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
a determination by the fda that a food additive petition is necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use  storage  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in some of the manufacturing processes 
our failure to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended and changes in environmental regulations may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
our agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including  the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those we conduct 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies could result in increased compliance costs 
the company is subject to the perishable agricultural commodities act paca law 
paca regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs all the product sold by apio 
our failure to comply with the paca requirements could among other things  result in civil penalties  suspension or revocation of a license to sell produce  and in the most egregious cases  criminal prosecution  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
adverse weather conditions and other acts of god may cause substantial decreases in our sales and or increases in our costs our food products and agricultural seed technology businesses are subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices  crop yields  and decisions by growers regarding crops to be planted 
crop diseases and severe conditions  particularly weather conditions such as floods  droughts  frosts  windstorms  earthquakes and hurricanes  may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in our business  which could reduce the sales volumes and or increase the unit production costs 
because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year  volume declines due to production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken our financial condition 
we depend on strategic partners and licenses for future development our strategy for development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing for some of our current and future products includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
we are dependent on our corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture and or market some of our products 
although we believe that our partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within our control 
our partners may not perform their obligations as expected or we may not derive any additional revenue from the arrangements 
our partners may not pay any additional option or license fees to us or may not develop  market or pay any royalty fees related to products under the agreements 
moreover  some of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and some of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under other circumstances 
in addition  we may not receive any royalties on future sales of quickcast and port products because we no longer have control over the sales of those products 
our partners may pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to our technology 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  and our collaborative arrangements may not be successful 
both domestic and foreign government regulations can have an adverse effect on our business operations our products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
the manufacture of our products is subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and polymer materials  regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to matters such as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances may adversely affect our business 
we are subject to usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  and suspensions  withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls and product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations and sales may expose our business to additional risks for fiscal year  approximately of our total revenues were derived from product sales to international customers 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by any of the following regulatory approval process  government controls  export license requirements  political instability  price controls  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  or difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our international business  and our financial condition and results of operations 
while our foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  may reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold 
regulatory  geopolitical and other factors may adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
cancellations or delays of orders by our customers may adversely affect our business during fiscal year  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues  with our largest customers  sam s club and costco wholesale corp  each accounting for approximately of our revenues 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues 
we may experience changes in the composition of our customer base  as apio and landec ag have experienced in the past 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with any of our customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since some of the products processed by apio at its guadalupe  california facility are often sole sourced to its customers  our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
our current customers may not continue to place orders  orders by existing customers may be canceled or may not continue at the levels of previous periods or we may not be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our sale of some products may increase our exposure to product liability claims the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products we develop involves an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
if any of our products were determined or alleged to be contaminated or defective or to have caused a harmful accident to an end customer  we could incur substantial costs in responding to complaints or litigation regarding our products and our product brand image could be materially damaged 
either event may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken and intend to continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims  we may not be able to avoid significant liability 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with limits in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the annual aggregate 
our coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at an acceptable cost  if at all 
a product liability claim  product recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions over the past several years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the following events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly technological innovations applicable to our products  our attainment of or failure to attain milestones in the commercialization of our technology  our development of new products or the development of new products by our competitors  new patents or changes in existing patents applicable to our products  our acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of our businesses  development of new collaborative arrangements by us  our competitors or other parties  changes in government regulations applicable to our business  changes in investor perception of our business  fluctuations in our operating results and changes in the general market conditions in our industry 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
since we order cartons and film for our products from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for such products  we could face a material inventory risk as part of our inventory planning  we enter into negotiated orders with vendors of cartons and film used for packing our products in advance of receiving customer orders for such products 
accordingly  we face the risk of ordering too many cartons and film since orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual orders 
if we cannot change or be released from the orders  we may incur costs as a result of inadequately predicting cartons and film orders in advance of customer orders 
because of this  we may currently have an oversupply of cartons and film and face the risk of not being able to sell such inventory and our anticipated reserves for losses may be inadequate if we have misjudged the demand for our products 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of these increased costs 
our seed products may fail to germinate properly and we may be subject to claims for reimbursement or damages for losses from customers who use such products farmers plant seed products sold by landec ag with the expectation that they will germinate under normal growing conditions 
if our seed products do not germinate at the appropriate time or fail to germinate at all  our customers may incur significant crop losses and seek reimbursement or bring claims against us for such damages 
although insurance is generally available to cover such claims  the costs for premiums of such policies are prohibitively expensive and we currently do not maintain such insurance 
any claims brought for failure of our seed products to properly germinate could materially and adversely affect our operating and financial results 
recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of the act that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
in addition  nasdaq has made revisions to its requirements for companies  such as landec  that are listed on the nasdaq 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs 
we expect these changes to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of the act 
our controlling shareholders exert significant influence over corporate events that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own or control approximately of our common stock including options exercisable within days 
accordingly  these officers  directors and shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval of amendments to our articles and bylaws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions requiring shareholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or other business combination transaction  even if the transaction or amendments would be beneficial to our other shareholders 
in addition  our controlling shareholders may approve amendments to our articles or bylaws to implement anti takeover or management friendly provisions that may not be beneficial to our other shareholders 
terrorist attacks and risk of contamination may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price the september terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic suppliers or our customers  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and are expected to continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for our products 
while we do not believe that our employees  facilities  or products are a target for terrorists  there is a remote risk that terrorist activities could result in contamination or adulteration of our products 
although we have systems and procedures in place that are designed to prevent contamination and adulteration of our products  a disgruntled employee or third party could introduce an infectious substance into packages of our products  either at our manufacturing plants or during shipment of our products 
were our products to be tampered with  we could experience a material adverse effect in our business  operations and financial condition 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect our business we have been subject in the past  and may be in the future  to claims by employees based on allegations of discrimination  negligence  harassment and inadvertent employment of illegal aliens or unlicensed personnel  and we may be subject to payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims 
we could incur substantial costs and our management could spend a significant amount of time responding to such complaints or litigation regarding employee claims  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on our key employees and if one or more of them were to leave  we could experience difficulties in replacing them and our operating results could suffer the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel would likely harm our business 
in addition  competition for senior level personnel with knowledge and experience in our different line of business is intense 
if any of our key personnel were to leave  we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 
we may issue preferred stock with preferential rights that could affect your rights our board of directors has the authority  without further approval of our shareholders  to fix the rights and preferences  and to issue shares  of preferred stock 
in november  we issued and sold shares of series a convertible preferred stock and in october we issued and sold shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock on november  and the series b convertible preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock on may  the issuance of new shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
we have never paid any dividends on our common stock we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since inception and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
any dividends may be subject to preferential dividends payable on any preferred stock we may issue 
the reporting of our profitability could be materially and adversely affected if it is determined that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value our balance sheet includes an amount designated as goodwill that represents a portion of our assets and our stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
under a newly issued accounting pronouncement  statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in fiscal year  the amortization of goodwill has been replaced with an impairment test which requires that we compare the fair value of goodwill to its book value at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
if we determine at any time in the future that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value then the difference must be written off  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability
