overview we provide securities brokerage and clearing execution services to our clients through our principal retail and clearing broker dealer  ameritrade  inc substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services 
our primary focus is serving retail clients by providing services at prices that are generally lower than most of our competitors 
our brokerage clients are able to trade securities with us through a variety of channels  principally the internet 
we provide our clients with investment news and information as well as educational services 
we also provide clearing and execution services to our brokerage operations as well as to unaffiliated broker dealers 

table of contents our largest sources of revenue are commissions earned from our brokerage activities and associated securities transaction clearing fees 
our other principal source of revenue is net interest revenue 
we also receive payment for order flow  which results from arrangements we have with many execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution and is included in commissions and clearing fees on the consolidated statements of operations 
our largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs  recruitment and other related employee costs 
clearing and execution costs include incremental third party expenses that tend to fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in client accounts or trades 
examples of expenses included in this category are statement and confirmation processing and postage costs and clearing expenses paid to the national securities clearing corporation  option exchanges and other market centers 
communications expense includes telecommunications  other postage  news and quote costs 
occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces and the lease expenses on computer and other equipment 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
professional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal  accounting  technology  marketing and general management issues 
interest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our prepaid variable forward contracts  convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings 
other operating expenses include provision for losses  client trade execution price adjustments  travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred and include production and placement of advertisements in various media  including online  television  print and direct mail 
advertising expenses may increase or decrease significantly from period to period 
we believe that the online securities brokerage market is currently impacted by four significant trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
first  price is an important component of the value proposition for the online securities brokerage market 
this trend has resulted in the implementation of various strategies such as tiered pricing  account maintenance fees  order handling fees and per share charges 
second  technology has increased in importance  as delivery channels such as the internet have become more prevalent 
the vast majority of our trades and a significant percentage of our client support activities are now placed through electronic media  primarily the internet 
this increased use of electronic media has helped to decrease operating expenses per trade over the past several years and we believe this trend will continue 
third  the increasing recognition of the need for scale and required investment in technology have resulted in consolidation in the industry 
finally  we believe the intense advertising and promotional efforts by our major competitors and us are making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to make a competitive impact without substantial financial resources to invest in building a brand 
our fiscal year ends on the last friday in september 
references to fiscal year in this document or in the information incorporated herein by reference are to the approximate twelve month period ended on any such friday 
for example  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended september  business combination on september   we completed our merger with datek 
pursuant to the merger agreement  ameritrade online holdings corp 
aoh formerly ameritrade holding corporation and datek each became wholly owned subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company  which was renamed ameritrade holding corporation 
upon the closing of the transaction  stockholders of aoh and datek each received shares of a single class of common stock of the new holding company  with the stockholders of aoh and the stockholders of datek each receiving approximately percent of the total outstanding common stock 
we have completed the integration of datek s business with ours 
datek s client call center function was moved to call centers in omaha  nebraska and ft 
worth  texas shortly after completion of the merger 
web site enhancements to both ameritrade s and datek s front end web sites  along with a new pricing schedule  were implemented on october  effective march   we consolidated the clearing function performed by datek into the ameritrade  inc clearing platform 
during fiscal  we phased in a single web 
table of contents architecture trading platform and began phasing in a single point of entry to the trading platform for both ameritrade and datek clients 
the introduction of the new single point of entry web site experience  which includes easier navigation  greater depth of information and new functionality  was announced on september  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact upon our financial results 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management s judgments and estimates and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill and acquired intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis  and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment tests  we utilize quoted market prices of our common stock to estimate the fair value of the company as a whole 
the estimated fair value is then allocated to our reporting units based on operating revenues  and is compared with the carrying value of the reporting units 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each reporting period to determine if events or trends warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
we have had no events or trends that have warranted a revision to the originally estimated useful lives 
no impairment charges have resulted from our annual impairment tests 
however  in fiscal  we announced plans to dispose of our tradecast subsidiaries 
an impairment loss of million was recorded during fiscal to reflect the amount by which the carrying value of the tradecast subsidiaries  including goodwill  exceeded its estimated fair value 
the impairment loss consisted of million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
valuation and accounting for derivative financial instruments we may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk  foreign currency risk or market risk 
our derivatives policy prohibits us from using derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge  which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific balance sheet item or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased 
in order to qualify as a hedge  a derivative must be designated as such by management  who must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item 
during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts  which are described later in this item under the heading prepaid variable forward contracts 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of our investment in knight common stock 
accordingly  all changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
to determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge  we must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of our hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions 
if our hedging strategy were to become ineffective  we could no longer apply hedge accounting and our reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 
estimates of effective income tax rates  deferred income taxes and valuation allowances we estimate our income tax expense based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current income tax obligations and to assess temporary differences between the 
table of contents financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we must evaluate the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we determine that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance results in corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  reducing income tax expense 
we must make significant judgments to calculate our provision for income taxes  our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
results of operations improved conditions in the us equity markets significantly impacted our results of operations during fiscal there is a positive correlation between the volume of our clients trading activity and our results of operations 
we cannot predict future trading volumes in the us equity markets 
if client trading activity improves  we expect that it would have a positive impact on our results of operations 
if client trading activity were to decline  we expect that it would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
financial performance metrics pre tax income  operating margin and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization are key metrics we use in evaluating our financial performance 
operating margin and ebitda are both considered non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec 
we define operating margin as pre tax income  adjusted to remove advertising expense and any unusual gains or charges 
we consider operating margin an important measure of the financial performance of our ongoing business 
advertising spending is excluded because it is largely at the discretion of the company  varies significantly from period to period based on market conditions and relates to the acquisition of future revenues through new accounts rather than current revenues from existing accounts 
unusual gains and charges are excluded because we believe they are not likely to be indicative of the ongoing operations of our business 
operating margin should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  pre tax income and net income 
we consider ebitda an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt  fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities 
ebitda eliminates the non cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization 
ebitda should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  pre tax income  net income and cash flows from operating activities

operating margin operating margin less advertising gain loss on disposal of property restructuring and asset impairment charges pre tax income loss ebitda ebitda less depreciation and amortization interest on borrowings pre tax income loss our improved pre tax income  operating margin and ebitda for fiscal compared to fiscal are largely due to significantly increased net revenues resulting primarily from increased client trading volumes and increased client margin and credit balances 
while net revenues increased  we did not incur corresponding significant increases in expenses 
more detailed analysis of net revenues and expenses is presented later in this discussion

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees increased percent  primarily due to higher average client trades per day and increased average commissions and clearing fees per trade 
average trades per day increased percent to  for fiscal from  in fiscal average client trades per account were during fiscal  compared to during fiscal  while the number of qualified accounts increased percent to million as of september   compared to million as of september  historically  qualified accounts have generated the vast majority of our revenues 
average commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to higher payment for order flow revenue per trade during fiscal compared to fiscal we currently expect average commissions and clearing fees per trade to range from approximately to per trade during fiscal  depending on the mix of trading activity  level of payment for order flow revenue and other factors 
net interest revenue increased percent  due primarily to a percent increase in average client margin balances  a percent increase in average segregated cash and a decrease of eight basis points in the average interest rate paid on client credit balances during fiscal compared to fiscal the increased net interest revenue resulting from these factors was partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate earned on segregated cash  a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate charged on client margin balances and an increase of percent in client credit balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal we generally expect net interest revenue to grow as our account base grows 
however  it will also be affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the levels of client margin borrowing and deposits 
other revenues decreased seven percent  due primarily to lower account maintenance fee income in fiscal and decreased licensing fee revenue due to the shutdown of our watcher technologies business in fiscal  partially offset by higher money market fee income during fiscal account maintenance fees are charged based on client assets and trading activity  therefore fluctuations in client assets or trades per account may result in fluctuations in revenues from account maintenance fees 
expenses employee compensation and benefits expense decreased percent  due primarily to the elimination of duplicate clearing and technology functions during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration  partially offset by client service employees added during fiscal to accommodate increased client trading volume 
full time equivalent employees totaled  at september   compared to  at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we also incurred approximately million of expense for bonuses based on synergies achieved in the datek merger and approximately million of compensation expense for stock appreciation rights sars assumed in the datek merger  due to increases in our stock price and costs of a cash out offer to sar holders 
as of september   there were approximately  remaining sars outstanding  compared with approximately million sars outstanding at the beginning of fiscal we expect total employee compensation and benefits expense to range between million and million for fiscal clearing and execution costs decreased percent  due primarily to approximately million in refunds and adjustments in the second quarter of fiscal for clearing and execution costs related to previous periods and the effect of eliminating duplicate clearing and execution costs subsequent to the datek merger in fiscal  partially offset by the effect of higher client trading volumes 
we expect clearing and execution costs to range between million and million for fiscal  depending on the volume of client trading and new accounts 
communications expense decreased four percent  due primarily to the elimination of duplicate telecommunications  quotes and market information infrastructure subsequent to the datek merger in fiscal  partially offset by the effect of higher client trading volumes 

table of contents occupancy and equipment costs decreased percent  due to facilities and equipment reductions during fiscal resulting from the datek merger and lower technology licensing costs 
we expect occupancy and equipment costs to be approximately million for fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased percent  due primarily to the effects of noncompete agreements related to the datek merger that expired and became fully amortized by the end of fiscal and tangible assets that have become fully depreciated 
professional services expense decreased percent  primarily due to increased usage of consulting services during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration 
we expect professional services expense to range between million and million for fiscal interest on borrowings decreased percent  primarily due to the redemption of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in october gain loss on disposal of property includes approximately million of gain recognized on the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility in fiscal other operating expenses decreased percent  due primarily to datek related litigation and arbitration matters that were resolved favorably during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect other operating expenses to range between million and million for fiscal advertising expenses increased percent 
we increased our advertising spending during fiscal in an effort to increase the number of new accounts  due primarily to improved stock market conditions during fiscal we generally adjust our level of advertising spending in relation to stock market activity  in an effort to maximize the number of new accounts while minimizing the advertising cost per new account 
we expect approximately million to million of advertising expenditures for fiscal  depending on market conditions 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of approximately million in severance costs related to the closing of tradecast and the integration of the datek and ameritrade technology organizations  and approximately million of non cancelable lease costs in connection with the closing of tradecast 
our effective income tax rate was approximately percent for fiscal  compared to approximately percent for fiscal the datek integration has resulted in a larger percentage of our payroll and assets being located in lower income tax states such as nebraska and texas as opposed to higher income tax states such as new york and new jersey 
the adjustment to our net deferred income tax liabilities to apply the current percent rate resulted in a lower than normal effective income tax rate for fiscal we expect our effective income tax rate to range from approximately percent to percent for fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees increased percent  primarily due to the full year impact of adding  accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the datek merger  increased client trading activity and increased commissions and clearing fees per trade 
average client trades per day increased percent to  for fiscal from  in fiscal clients averaged approximately trades per account during fiscal  compared to approximately trades per account for fiscal average commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to in fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to the implementation of a new pricing schedule effective october  and an increase in the average number of contracts per options trade  partially offset by slightly lower payment for order flow revenue per trade during fiscal compared to fiscal net interest revenue increased percent 
average client margin balances increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to the datek merger 
average segregated cash increased by percent in fiscal from fiscal  due primarily to the datek merger 
the increased interest income 
table of contents resulting from the higher average client margin balances and average segregated cash was partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate charged on client margin balances  a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate earned on segregated cash and an increase of percent in average client credit balances in fiscal from fiscal other revenues increased percent  due primarily to increased account maintenance  clearing and other fee income resulting from the datek merger 
expenses employee compensation and benefits expense increased percent 
although full time equivalent employees decreased percent to  at the end of fiscal from  at the end of fiscal  the average number of full time equivalent employees during fiscal increased by approximately nine percent compared to fiscal as a result of the datek merger 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of expense for bonuses based on synergies achieved in the datek merger and approximately million of compensation expense for stock appreciation rights assumed in the datek merger  due to increases in our stock price and costs of a cash out offer to sar holders during fiscal clearing and execution costs increased percent  primarily due to the significantly increased transaction volume and accounts added through the datek merger 
communications expense increased percent  due primarily to increased expense for quotes  market information and telecommunications costs associated with additional accounts and transaction processing volumes resulting from the datek merger 
occupancy and equipment costs were virtually unchanged  as facilities and equipment reductions in existing ameritrade locations were offset by facilities added in the datek merger 
depreciation and amortization increased percent  due primarily to amortization of intangible assets recorded in the datek merger  partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to the effect of tangible assets that have become fully depreciated 
professional services expense increased percent  primarily due to increased usage of consulting services during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration 
interest on borrowings was approximately million for both fiscal and fiscal lower average borrowings on our revolving credit agreement were offset by interest expense associated with the forward contracts on our knight investment in fiscal we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit agreement during fiscal gain loss on disposal of property includes approximately million of gain recognized on the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility in fiscal other operating expenses increased percent  due primarily to increased transaction volume and accounts added through the datek merger 
advertising expenses increased percent  principally due to our introduction of a new suite of products and services and new pricing schedule during the first quarter of fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of approximately million in severance costs related to the closing of tradecast and the integration of the datek and ameritrade technology organizations  and approximately million of non cancelable lease costs in connection with the closing of tradecast 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of a million impairment charge to reflect the amount by which the carrying value of the tradecast subsidiaries exceeded its estimated fair value 
the impairment loss consisted of million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was approximately percent for fiscal we recorded income tax expense in 
table of contents fiscal despite having a pre tax loss before income taxes  due primarily to the nondeductible goodwill component of tradecast impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from operations and from borrowings under our credit agreements 
we have also issued common stock and convertible subordinated notes to finance mergers and acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
our liquidity needs during fiscal were financed primarily from our earnings and cash on hand  and  to a lesser extent  borrowings on our credit facilities 
we plan to finance our capital and liquidity needs primarily from our earnings and cash on hand 
in addition  we may utilize our revolving credit facility or issue equity or debt securities 
dividends from our subsidiaries are another source of liquidity for the holding company 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the sec and nasd relating to liquidity  capital standards  and the use of client funds and securities  which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
under the sec s uniform net capital rule rule c under the securities exchange act of  our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain at all times at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule c this minimum net capital level is determined based upon an involved calculation described in rule c that is primarily based on each broker dealer s aggregate debits  which primarily are a function of client margin receivables at our broker dealer subsidiaries 
since our aggregate debits may fluctuate significantly  our minimum net capital requirements may also fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the holding company may make cash capital contributions to broker dealer subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet net capital requirements 
on november   our broker dealer subsidiary ameritrade  inc was notified by the staff of the nasd and the staff of the sec division of market regulation collectively the staffs that in their view ameritrade  inc s net capital was below its minimum amount required under exchange act rule c the asserted deficiency was based upon the staffs concerns regarding a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured deposit sweep program available to ameritrade  inc s clients 
ameritrade  inc 
cured the asserted deficiency the next business day  november  we continue to discuss this matter with the staffs 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
liquid assets we consider liquid assets an important measure of our liquidity and of our ability to fund corporate investing and financing activities 
liquid assets is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the sec 
we define liquid assets as the sum of a non broker dealer cash and cash equivalents and b regulatory net capital of our broker dealer subsidiaries in excess of of aggregate debit items 
we include the excess regulatory net capital of our broker dealer subsidiaries in liquid assets rather than simply including broker dealer cash and cash equivalents  because regulatory net capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the broker dealer subsidiaries to the holding company 
liquid assets should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity  rather than as a substitute for cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to liquid assets for the periods indicated in thousands september  september  change cash and cash equivalents less broker dealer cash and cash equivalents non broker dealer cash and cash equivalents plus excess broker dealer regulatory net capital liquid assets includes the impact of a regulatory matter related to an fdic insured deposit sweep program as of september  excluding the impact of the regulatory matter  excess broker dealer regulatory net capital would be approximately million and liquid assets would be approximately million as of september  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the regulatory matter 
the decrease in liquid assets from september  to september  is primarily due to cash used in investing and financing activities of million see cash flow below  the impact of the regulatory matter of million and an increase in aggregate debit items that resulted in increased regulatory net capital required of million  partially offset by net income of million 
the remaining million of the change in liquid assets is due to non cash expenses that are reflected in net income  changes in non broker dealer working capital due to timing of income tax and other payments  and other miscellaneous changes in excess regulatory net capital 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal cash flow activity in fiscal included substantial reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities assumed in the datek merger  which were funded by cash acquired in the datek merger 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal the cash used in investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million paid in the acquisition of bidwell company and two small account acquisition transactions 
the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was due primarily to million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility 
we expect to pay approximately million in fiscal in connection with our acquisition of the online retail accounts of jb oxford company 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal the financing activities consisted mainly of million of stock repurchases and the early redemption of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
we also borrowed and repaid million on our revolving credit agreement and million on ameritrade northwest  inc s formerly bidwell secured credit facility to fund daily liquidity needs 
loan facilities on december   we entered into a third amended and restated revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement permitted borrowings of up to million through december   and was secured primarily by our stock in our subsidiaries and personal property 
the interest rate on borrowings  determined on a monthly basis  was equal to the lesser of i the national prime rate or ii one month libor plus percent 
at september   the interest rate on the revolving credit agreement would have been percent 
we also paid a commitment fee of percent of the unused borrowings through the maturity date 
we had no outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement at september  and no outstanding indebtedness under the prior revolving credit agreement at september  the revolving credit agreement contained certain covenants and restrictions  including limitations on borrowings

our wholly owned broker dealer subsidiaries  ameritrade  inc and iclearing llc iclearing  had access to secured uncommitted credit facilities with financial institutions of up to million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
ameritrade  inc also had access to unsecured uncommitted credit facilities of up to million as of september  and september  the financial institutions may make loans under line of credit arrangements or  in some cases  issue letters of credit under these facilities 
the secured credit facilities require the company to pledge client securities to secure outstanding obligations under these facilities 
borrowings under the secured and unsecured credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate based on the federal funds rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the secured or unsecured credit facilities as of september  or september  letters of credit in the amount of million as of september   were issued on our behalf and reduced the amount available for borrowings under these credit facilities 
the letters of credit  which were for the benefit of a securities clearinghouse  were issued for the contingent purpose of financing and supporting margin requirements 
we are generally required to pledge client securities to secure letters of credit under these credit facilities 
no letters of credit were issued as of september  as of september  and september   approximately million and million  respectively  was available to the company for either loans or  in some cases  letters of credit 
prepaid variable forward contracts during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts the forward contracts with a counterparty with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain a zero cost embedded collar on the value of the knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
at the inception of the forward contracts  we received cash of approximately million  equal to approximately percent of the notional amount 
the forward contracts mature on various dates in fiscal years and at maturity  we may settle the forward contracts in shares of knight or in cash  at our option 
if the market price of the knight stock at maturity is equal to or less than the floor price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive one share of knight or its cash equivalent for each underlying share 
if the market price of the knight stock at maturity is greater than the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of shares of knight or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price plus the excess of the market price over the cap price  divided by the market price  for each underlying share 
if the market price at maturity is greater than the floor price but less than or equal to the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of knight shares or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price divided by the market price for each underlying share 
regardless of whether the forward contract is settled in knight shares or in cash  we intend to sell the underlying knight shares at maturity 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of million knight shares 
the forward contracts are expected to be perfectly effective hedges against changes in the cash flows associated with the forecasted future sales outside the price ranges of the collars 
accordingly  all changes in the fair value of the embedded collars are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
as of september  and september   the total fair value of the embedded collars was 
table of contents approximately million and million  respectively  and was included under the caption prepaid variable forward derivative instrument on the consolidated balance sheets 
the million of cash received on the forward contracts is accounted for as an obligation on the consolidated balance sheets 
we are accreting interest on the obligation to the notional maturity amount of million over the terms of the forward contracts using effective interest rates with a weighted average of approximately percent 
upon settlement of a forward contract  the fair value of the collar and the realized gain or loss on the knight stock delivered to the counterparty or otherwise sold will be reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings 
stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock from time to time over a two year period beginning september  on may   our board of directors extended the stock repurchase program through may  under the stock repurchase program  as extended  we may repurchase  from time to time  up to million shares of our common stock  a million share increase from the previous authorization 
through september   we have repurchased a total of approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements

risk factors stock market volatility and other securities industry risks could adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from securities brokerage and clearing and execution services 
like other securities brokerage businesses  we are directly affected by economic and political conditions  broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
since may  the us securities markets have been very volatile  which has resulted in volatility in trading volume and net revenues 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   the invasion of iraq in and other events also resulted in substantial market volatility and accompanying reductions in trading volume and net revenues 
in addition  any general economic downturn would adversely affect trading volumes and net revenues 
severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect our profitability 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock  and the us securities markets in general  have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
the market prices of securities of internet related companies  in particular  have been especially volatile 
the price of our common stock could decrease substantially 
in addition  because the market price of our common stock tends to fluctuate significantly  we could become the object of securities class action litigation which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
substantial competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
the market for electronic brokerage services is young  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect the competitive environment to continue in the future 
we face direct competition from numerous online brokerage firms  including charles schwab co  inc  e trade financial corporation  td waterhouse group  inc  fidelity investments and scottrade  inc we also encounter competition from the broker dealer affiliates of established full commission brokerage firms as well as from financial institutions  mutual fund sponsors and other organizations  some of which provide online brokerage services 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  offer a wider range of services and financial products  and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base than we do 
we believe that the general financial success of companies within the online securities industry will continue to attract new competitors to the industry  such as banks  software development companies  insurance companies  providers of online financial information and others 
these companies may provide a more comprehensive suite of services than we do 
in addition  our clearing operations compete with numerous firms that provide clearing and execution services to the securities industry 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
systems failures and delays could harm our business 
we receive and process trade orders through a variety of electronic channels  including the internet  wireless web  personal digital assistants and our interactive voice response system 
these methods of trading are heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting them 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  power loss  computer viruses  distributed denial of service ddos attacks  spurious spam attacks  intentional acts of vandalism and 
table of contents similar events 
though all of our core computer systems and applications are fully redundant and distributed over two sites  it could take up to four hours or more to restore full functionality in the event of an unforeseen disaster 
extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably low speed or even fail 
extraordinary internet traffic caused by ddos or spam attacks could cause our web site to be unavailable or slow to respond 
while we have invested significant amounts in the last few years to upgrade the reliability and scalability of our systems and added hardware to address extraordinary internet traffic  there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle such extraordinary circumstances 
in the past  we experienced periods of extremely high trading volume that caused individual system components or processes to fail  resulting in the temporary unavailability of our web site for online trading and delays in our telephone systems 
on some other occasions  high trading volume caused significant delays in executing trading orders  resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate 
from time to time  we have reimbursed our clients for losses incurred in connection with systems failures and delays 
systems failures and delays could occur again in the future and could cause  among other things  unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients  slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire  decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction  and harm to our reputation 
if any of these events were to occur  we could suffer a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of our client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or other client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
our networks could be vulnerable to security risks 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations 
we have not experienced network security problems in the past that have resulted in significant loss to our clients 
however  our networks could be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or our clients confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we could be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we may not be able to implement security measures that will protect against all security risks 
capacity constraints of our systems could harm our business 
if our business increases  we may need to expand and upgrade our transaction processing systems  network infrastructure and other aspects of our technology 
many of our systems are  and much of our infrastructure is  designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  however  we may need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
we may not be able to project accurately the rate  timing or cost of any increases in our business  or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner 
failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to our systems and infrastructure could lead to failures and delays  which could cause a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of the client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
the securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business 
the sec  nasd and other self regulatory organizations and state and foreign regulators can  among other things  censure  fine  issue cease and desist orders to  suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees 
while we neither actively solicit new accounts nor 
table of contents have established offices outside the united states and canada  our websites are accessible world wide over the internet and we currently have account holders located outside the united states and canada 
these accounts make up approximately of our accounts and are spread across many jurisdictions 
any adverse action by foreign regulators with respect to regulatory compliance by us in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our revenues from clients in such country or region 
recently  various regulatory and enforcement agencies have been reviewing mutual fund trading  regulatory reporting obligations  best execution practices  client privacy  system security and safeguarding practices  regulation t compliance and advertising claims as they relate to the brokerage industry 
these reviews could result in enforcement actions or new regulations  which could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  we use the internet as a major distribution channel to provide services to our clients 
a number of regulatory agencies have recently adopted regulations regarding client privacy  system security and safeguarding practices and the use of client information by service providers 
additional laws and regulations relating to the internet could be adopted in the future  including regulations regarding the pricing  taxation  content and quality of products and services delivered over the internet 
complying with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming and could limit our ability to use the internet as a distribution channel 
the success of our business will depend on continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face similar outages and delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on our web site 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity 
our principal stockholders are parties to a stockholders agreement  which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
as of november   j 
joe ricketts  our chairman and founder  members of his family and trusts held for their benefit collectively  the ricketts holders owned approximately of our common stock and investment funds affiliated with silver lake partners and ta associates collectively  the datek holders owned approximately of our common stock 
the datek holders and the ricketts holders are parties to a stockholders agreement  which terminates in  that obligates the parties to vote their shares in favor of a board of directors  of which currently three are to be designated by the ricketts holders  two are to be designated by the datek holders and three are to be independent directors selected with the agreement of the parties 
the agreement also obligates the parties to vote in favor of specified merger and sale of the company transactions that are approved by the requisite directors and to vote against specified merger and sale of the company transactions unless they are approved by the requisite directors 
accordingly  these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of these stockholders could differ from the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  third parties could be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership or the provisions of the stockholders agreement 

table of contents the terms of the stockholders agreement  our charter documents and delaware law could inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in the stockholders agreement among the ricketts holders and the datek holders  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law will make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors 
these provisions include the presence of a classified board of directors  the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
we will need to introduce new products and services to remain competitive 
our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services 
there are significant technical and financial risks in the development of new or enhanced products and services  including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our services to emerging industry standards  or develop  introduce and market enhanced or new products and services 
in addition  the adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
changes in payments for routing our clients orders could adversely affect our business 
we have arrangements with several execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution 
competition between execution agents and the implementation of order handling rules and decimalization of stock prices have made it less profitable for execution agents to offer order flow payments to broker dealers 
on a per trade basis  our payment for order flow revenue has decreased significantly over the past several years 
these payments could continue to decrease on a per trade basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the sec currently is inquiring into brokerage industry trade execution practices at the market open  including any related payment for order flow 
the sec could take action to prohibit payment for order flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
failure to comply with net capital requirements could adversely affect our business 
the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is a measure  defined by the sec  of a broker dealer s readily available liquid assets  reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt 
all of our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to comply with the net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  the sec could suspend or revoke our registration  or nasd could expel us from membership  which could ultimately lead to our liquidation  or they could impose censures  fines or other sanctions 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business 
for example  on november   our broker dealer subsidiary ameritrade  inc was notified by the staff of the nasd and the staff of the sec division of market regulation collectively the staffs that in their view ameritrade  inc s net capital was below its minimum amount required under exchange act rule c the asserted deficiency was based upon the staffs concerns regarding a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured deposit sweep program available to ameritrade  inc s clients 
ameritrade  inc 
cured the asserted deficiency the next business day  november  we continue to 
table of contents discuss this matter with the staffs 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
our clearing operations expose us to liability for errors in clearing functions 
ameritrade  inc provides clearing and execution services to each of our brokerage businesses  as well as to independent broker dealers  depository institutions  registered investment advisors and financial planners 
clearing and execution services include the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions 
clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the possession and control of client securities and other assets and the clearance of client securities transactions 
self clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients and introducing brokers  could lead to civil penalties imposed by applicable authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits brought by clients and others 
we are exposed to credit risk 
we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities and periodically borrow and lend securities to cover trades 
a significant portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a client s indebtedness 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our business 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations  services and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies  amortization of acquired intangible assets  which could reduce future reported earnings  potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies  and dilution to existing stockholders 
as part of our growth strategy  we regularly consider  and from time to time engage in  discussions and negotiations regarding strategic transactions such as acquisitions  mergers and combinations within our industry 
the purchase price for possible acquisitions could be paid in cash  through the issuance of common stock or other of our securities  borrowings or a combination of these methods 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to identify and to consummate strategic transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing  likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction 
for example  in many cases we begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons 
however  opportunities may arise from time to time that we will evaluate 
any transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us 
these risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be realized  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

table of contents failure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to internal control requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules and regulations adopted by the sec and the public company accounting oversight board 
these laws  rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future 
we have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  including  but not limited to  the increased allocation of internal audit department resources  documentation of existing controls and implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate 
to date  several control deficiencies have been identified and we are in the process of remediating them 
on november   our broker dealer subsidiary ameritrade  inc was notified by the staff of the nasd and the staff of the sec division of market regulation collectively the staffs that they believe that for regulatory purposes certain funds held in banks on behalf of clients are liabilities and assets of ameritrade  inc rather than liabilities and assets only of the banks 
the resulting assets have not been allowed for purposes of ameritrade  inc s regulatory net capital calculation 
accordingly  in the staffs view ameritrade  inc s net capital was below its minimum amount required under exchange act rule c our independent registered public accounting firm has concluded that the controls in place relating to the matter were not properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that these funds were properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements and assets were appropriately considered in regulatory net capital computations 
in their judgment  this is a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this regulatory matter 
we continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls  and to planning for and implementation of remedial efforts in those instances where remediation is indicated 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we could be subject to regulatory actions  civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation 
in addition  failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we seek to control the risks associated with our client activities by requiring clients to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
we monitor required margin levels daily and  pursuant to such guidelines  require our clients to deposit additional collateral  or to reduce positions  when necessary 
we seek to control risks associated with our securities lending and borrowing activities by requiring credit approvals for counterparties  by monitoring the market value of securities loaned and collateral values for securities borrowed on a daily basis and requiring additional cash as collateral for securities loaned or return of collateral for securities borrowed when necessary  and by participating in a risk sharing program offered through a securities clearinghouse 
as a fundamental part of our brokerage business  we hold interest earning assets  mainly funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
these funds totaled billion at september  and billion at september  we invest these funds in repurchase agreements  fixed rate us treasury securities and other qualified securities 
our interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  totaling billion at september  and billion at september   in the form of client credit balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on client margin balances and amounts paid on client credit balances 
because we establish the rate paid on client credit balances and the rate charged on client margin balances  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
however  changes in interest rates may have a beneficial or adverse affect on our results of operations 
we might not change interest rates paid on client credit balances proportionately to changes in interest rates charged on client margin balances 
as a result  a 
table of contents rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread 
conversely  a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
at september  and september   we had and million  respectively  of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  which bore interest at a fixed rate of percent 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at a floating rate  as of september  and september  we hold two marketable equity securities  our investments in approximately million shares of knight and  shares of the nasdaq stock market  inc  which were recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  and have exposure to market price risk 
the same securities were recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in prices quoted by the stock exchanges was approximately million at september  during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain an embedded collar on the value of the knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of million knight shares 
as of september  and september   the fair value of the embedded collars was approximately million and million  respectively  and was included under the caption prepaid variable forward derivative instrument on the consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts are expected to be perfectly effective hedges against changes in cash flows associated with changes in the value of knight shares outside the price ranges of the collars 
at september   we had an equity index swap arrangement for the purpose of hedging our obligation under our deferred compensation plan for our ceo 
changes in the fair value of this instrument were offset by changes in our obligation to our ceo 
effective april   the ceo changed his investment election under the deferred compensation arrangement from an equity index to a group of fixed income securities 
accordingly  we terminated our equity index swap arrangement 
our revenues and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars  and we generally do not invest  except for hedging purposes  in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments
