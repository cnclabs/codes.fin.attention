table of contents our ft interactive data  cms bondedge and comstock businesses comprise our institutional services business segment  and our esignal business is our retail investor business segment 
all of our services are provided on a subscription basis 
most of the subscriptions are for a fixed fee  others are billed  at least in part  on a usage basis 
we have historically achieved high retention rates  particularly from our institutional client base 
through a broad range of business alliances  many of the world s best known financial service and software companies utilize our services in support of their trading  analysis  portfolio management  and valuation activities 
at the core of our business are our customer relationships  business alliances  broad databases  extensive product and technical know how and technology infrastructure resources 
development of business prior to february   our business related primarily to the delivery of historical and end of day financial data to institutional customers through what is now our ft interactive data business 
on february   data broadcasting corporation merged with interactive data corporation now known as ft interactive data 
this merger brought together the businesses of data broadcasting corporation which included esignal and cms bondedge with the businesses of interactive data corporation now known as ft interactive data 
as a result of this transaction  approximately of the shares of the company are held directly or indirectly by pearson plc 
on january   we acquired the securities pricing services of merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated for approximately million 
we acquired from the mcgraw hill companies  inc s s p division  the stock of s p comstock  inc 
and the assets of specific comstock related mcgraw hill businesses in the united kingdom  france  australia  singapore and hong kong for approximately million on february  we acquired the consolidated market data feed client contracts from hyperfeed technologies  inc for million on october  the price for these client contracts consisted of an initial payment of million with the balance to be paid over months if agreed upon milestones are reached 
we are currently migrating the hyperfeed technologies  inc customers from the hyperfeed production platform to our comstock production platform 
we expect this migration to be concluded by the end of as a result of these acquisitions  our results of operations for and include the activities of our ft interactive data  cms bondedge and esignal businesses 
our results of operations  in addition to the three aforementioned businesses  include months of activities for comstock  including two months of activities resulting from the acquisition of the hyperfeed customer contracts 
in reference to our ongoing core business the discussion that follows  is comprised of our ft interactive data  cms bondedge and esignal businesses and  excludes our comstock and hyperfeed businesses 
we have provided specific information separately for our ongoing core businesses and our comstock and hyperfeed businesses because we believe it is helpful to understand the underlying trends in our performance and to provide additional information that makes it easier to compare our results over multiple periods 
business and market trends in  market conditions for our primary market  the financial services industry  continued to remain difficult  with economic uncertainty adversely impacting the industry and our customers 
the largest business within the institutional services segment  ft interactive data  experienced strong cost containment pressure from its customer base 
this manifested itself in customers seeking to renegotiate service levels and prices 
customers analyzed their current data needs and eliminated duplicate or unnecessary services 
cancellations were higher than customary 
despite the challenging market conditions  we continued to generate new business  some of which was eroded by cancellations 
we believe that much of the data we supply is mission critical to our customers and necessary for their operations regardless of market conditions  however  we are affected  at least in part  by the continuing cost pressures being experienced by our client base 
if the data we provided were not mission critical  we believe the difficult market conditions would have affected us more adversely 
there has been and continues to be a trend in north america for major financial institutions to outsource their back office operations to service bureaus and custodian banks 
we have established relationships with  and are a major data supplier to  many service bureaus and custodian banks  and have benefited and expect to 
table of contents continue to benefit from their growth 
another trend over the past decade in north america is the consolidation of financial institutions both within and across the financial service industry 
when institutions merge  they look to gain synergies by combining their operations  including eliminating the need for redundant data sources 
this has contributed to some of the higher than normal cancellations we have been experiencing 
to the extent customer consolidations occur  this could have a continuing effect on customer cancellations 
these cancellations do not necessarily occur simultaneously with the closing of customer mergers  rather the cancellations occur post closing as the institutions seek to gain the consolidation synergies 
growth in the ft interactive data market is dependent on our ability to continue to expand our data content offerings to meet the current and evolving needs of our clients 
this would include responding to changes in the financial markets as well as regulatory and competitive pressures 
this would also include continuing to expand the coverage of premium priced fixed income data sets and the launch of new services such as our fair value information service  which is primarily oriented towards north american mutual funds 
in addition  we will continue to seek to expand our market share in continental europe  although we expect current difficult market conditions will slow this effort as customers take longer to make purchase decisions than they historically have taken 
due to the difficult industry conditions described above  purchasing decisions in north america are also expected to take longer than in normal market conditions 
the cms bondedge business continued to grow throughout  although it experienced many of the same pressures as ft interactive data 
the cms bondedge business is dependent on activity levels in the us financial markets and the financial performance of the major financial institutions 
if the financial markets continue to improve  we would expect this to translate into more favorable operating conditions for cms bondedge 
the comstock business  which we acquired in february  met our revenue expectations 
in the markets that it operates  comstock continued to experience strong price pressures  with customers being focused on cost containment 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be promoting the comstock service widely to ft interactive data s institutional customer base 
the comstock business was reinforced by the acquisition of hyperfeed technologies  inc s consolidated market data feed client contracts at the end of october  in our retail services segment  the esignal business continues to strengthen its position as a leading real time financial data provider primarily for retail and professional investors 
we continued to experience positive net growth in subscribers in a source of new subscribers continued to be from distribution channels that generated incremental revenues at a lower rate than from direct sales 
although the number of subscribers continues to increase substantially  per subscriber revenue has declined

revenues for our ft interactive data business increased from  to  an increase of  or 
the main growth for our ft interactive data business came from north america  where despite difficult market conditions and a higher than historical level of cancellations  revenues grew by 
the performance was driven by continued success with sale of evaluated prices helped by the introduction of our fair value information service  and moderate price increases 
the uk business of ft interactive data declined by from to with new sales being more than offset by high levels of cancellations and customers requesting service downgrades 
the asia pacific business grew by  with the main growth coming from australia 
in the other key markets of hong kong and singapore  revenues were relatively flat 
our cms bondedge business grew revenues by or  as we continued to see a slowdown in new business as a result of the reluctance of customers to commit to new services in the current economic environment 
if the economic environment and the financial markets continue to improve  we would expect to see this reluctance to begin to subside  which should translate into new business revenues 
our comstock business performed in line with our expectations during the ten months of progress was made in promoting the comstock real time feed service to the ft interactive data customer base 
we expect to continue this promotion throughout with the acquisition of hyperfeed technologies  inc s consolidated market data feed client contracts on october   we are fully engaged in migrating this customer base from the hyperfeed production platform to the existing comstock production platform 
other revenues declined by  which mainly represents a slow down in our real time foreign exchange data business which we were integrating with the comstock business in in  we expect that this will be fully integrated within the comstock business 
within our retail investor services segment  revenues grew by  or from  to  which includes an expected decline in the broadcast business amounting to  this anticipated decline in the broadcast business is expected to continue as the remaining customers migrate to alternative information sources including esignal s internet based service

in addition  the write off of certain capitalized development costs in europe in contributed to the overall reduction 
offsetting these savings were restructuring charges totaling  related to the first stage in the integration of our us data centers  severance relating to the decision to move some of our european data collection to a lower cost site and costs related to the closure of our index services unit in edinburgh  scotland

related parties transactions we and pearson plc pearson are parties to a management services agreement that became effective as of february  pearson owns approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock 
this agreement governs the provision of services by either company to the other and renews annually 
pursuant to the agreement  pearson provides certain services us and we provide certain services to pearson 
the services provided by pearson afford us administrative convenience and we believe the terms of such services are more favorable to us than if we had negotiated similar arrangements with non affiliated third parties 
the services provided by pearson include administering k  travel employee health benefit plans and insurance plans in the united states and united kingdom and billing  accounts payable  accounts receivable  computer and accounting system support  financial accounting  tax and payroll services related to certain of our subsidiaries  primarily in the united kingdom

prior to entering into any service arrangement with pearson  we assess whether it would be more advantageous to obtain such services from a third party 
certain of our directors are employees of pearson 
the independent committee of our board of directors  which consists of four directors  none of whom are employees of pearson  approved the management services agreement on our behalf 
there was no material effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of entering into this agreement 
if pearson s services to us were to be terminated  we would be required to seek equivalent services in the open market at potentially increased costs 
in addition  we would lose the efficiencies of working in concert with pearson  and would bear the entire burden of administrating such services  resulting in an increased demand on our administrative resources 
the management services agreement is amended from time to time by mutual agreement to address changes in the terms or services provided to or on our behalf 
the independent committee approves any such amendments 
from time to time  we assess the ongoing relationships between the company and pearson  and if we 
table of contents determine that it would be more advantageous for us to secure any such services outside of pearson  we pursue doing so 
in  pearson s financial times group entered into a trademark license agreement with us authorizing us to use the ft and financial times trademarks and logos in our business

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  goodwill and intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes  retirement plans  stock based compensation and contingencies and commitments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized over contractual periods as services are performed 
amounts recognized as revenue are determined based upon contractually agreed upon fee schedules with our customers 
we account for subscription revenues received in advance of service being performed by deferring such amounts until the related services are performed 
from time to time  we are required to adjust revenue associated with incorrect 
table of contents billings and data accessed inadvertently by customers 
we maintain a reserve for these adjustments based upon historical experience and believe that the reserve established as of december  is adequate 
goodwill goodwill is recorded in connection with business acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the acquisition date 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
as a result of the adoption of this standard  we ceased recording amortization expense associated with our goodwill 
fas requires an impairment test for our reporting units to be performed on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
each impairment test is based upon a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit  determined using a discounted cash flow model to the net book value of the reporting unit 
projections used in these analyses are consistent with those used by management to run the company and make capital allocation decisions 
if impairment is indicated due to the book value being in excess of the fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
we typically utilize the services of a third party business valuation firm to assist in this process 
accrued liabilities we maintain balances for certain accrued liabilities as they relate to employee costs such as bonuses and other costs such as data charges and royalties 
these amounts are based upon management s best estimates and judgment based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
retirement plans we record pension activity in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
pearson inc  a pearson us subsidiary  sponsors a defined benefit plan the plan for pearson s us employees and the plan also includes certain of our us employees 
pension costs are actuarially determined 
we fund pension costs attributable to our employees to the extent allowable under irs regulations 
in  we froze the benefits associated with the plan 
there was no gain or loss recorded as a result of the curtailment 
the actuarially determined liability is based on estimates such as the discount rate associated with future liabilities under the plan  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase of compensation costs of participants in the plan 
these estimates are based on our best estimates of future events associated with the plan 
stock based compensation in  we adopted the long term incentive plan as amended from time to time  the plan 
under the plan  the compensation committee of the board of directors can grant stock based awards representing up to of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of grant 
the plan provides for the discretionary issuance of stock based awards to directors  officers  and employees as well as persons who provide consulting or other services to us 
the exercise price of options granted employees under the plan is determined at the discretion of the compensation committee 
the exercise price for all options granted to date has been equal to the market price at the date of grant 
options expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a three to four year period 
the plan has a ten year term and terminates in february in  we adopted an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
under the plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased at six month intervals at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month period 
in  employees purchased approximately  shares at a price of per share 
in  employees purchased approximately  shares at a price of per share 
as of december    shares were reserved for future issuance 
in june  we awarded deferred stock compensation to certain executives under the plan 
we granted an aggregate of  deferred stock units of common stock 
under the plan  the shares are available for distribution  at no cost  to these individuals at the end of a three year vesting period 
the total 
table of contents deferred compensation cost related to this grant is  which will be amortized over a three year period 
as of december   has been expensed 
the remaining unamortized deferred compensation cost at december  is  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we apply apb opinion no 
in accounting for stock based compensation and  accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for stock options or employee stock purchase plan in the consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets include securities databases  computer software  covenants not to compete  and customer lists arising principally from acquisitions 
such intangibles are valued on the acquisition dates based on a combination of replacement cost and comparable purchase methodologies by a third party appraiser and are amortized over periods ranging from two to twenty five years 
the carrying amount of these balances is evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance and fair value of the underlying assets 
adjustments are recorded if the fair value is determined to be less than book value 
income taxes income tax assets and liabilities are determined by taxable jurisdiction 
we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
taxes have not been provided on approximately  of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings  which are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
we have net operating loss carry forwards nols that were generated in prior years 
the annual utilization of the nols is restricted by applicable tax regulations 
we have provided a valuation allowance for certain nols whose utilization is dependent upon state tax limitations 
throughout the year we determine our periodic income tax expense based upon our current period income and our estimated annual effective tax rate 
the rate is revised  if necessary  at the end of each successive interim period during the fiscal year to our best current estimate of our annual effective tax rate 
commitment and contingencies we have no outstanding debt 
we meet our existing working capital and capital expenditure needs from our existing operating cash flow 
in  we entered into an unsecured credit facility for  with keybank national association that expired on may  during and  there were no borrowings associated with this credit facility and at december   there was no outstanding balance 
we did not renew the facility 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for real estate  equipment and distribution agreements for satellite and cable space and fm radio channels 
certain of the leases include renewal options and escalation clauses 
real estate leases are for our corporate headquarters  sales offices  major operating units and data centers 
approximate annual future commitments under non cancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one year are as follows real estate distribution and equipment agreements thereafter total minimum lease payments we expect to satisfy our lease obligations from our existing cash flow 
our key operating locations operate in facilities under long term leases  the earliest of which will expire in we believe we will be able to 
table of contents successfully negotiate key operating leases and or find alternative locations for our facilities without significant interruption to the business 
inflation although management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years  there can be no assurance that results of operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality we have not experienced any material seasonal fluctuations in our business 
however  financial information market demand is largely dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets 
in the event that the us financial markets were to suffer a prolonged period of investor inactivity in trading securities  our business could be adversely affected 
the degree of such consequences is uncertain 
exposures in this area are somewhat mitigated by our service offerings in non us markets

the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin no 
provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not 
table of contents have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin no 
requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to interests held in certain variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if the vie or potential vie was created before february  and the entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie in accordance with fin  other than in certain disclosures required

information regarding forward looking statements from time to time  including in this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders  we may issue forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  strategy  plans  critical accounting policies  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
we note that a variety of factors  including known and unknown risks and uncertainties as well as incorrect assumptions  could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the factors that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business include the following we compete against companies with greater financial resources 
we operate in highly competitive markets in which we compete with other distributors of financial and business information and related services 
we expect competition to continue to be rigorous 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
these competitors may be able to expand product offerings and data content more effectively and to respond more rapidly than us to 
table of contents new or emerging technologies  changes in the industry or changes in customer needs 
they may also be in a position to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
increased competition in the future could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or maintain our margins  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
a prolonged outage at one of our data centers could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers 
our customers rely on us for time sensitive  up to date data that is reliably delivered 
our business is dependent on our ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial quantities of data and transactions on our computer based networks and systems 
our computer operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars  internet failures  computer viruses and other events beyond our reasonable control 
we maintain back up facilities for each of our major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations 
in addition  we maintain insurance for such events  however  the business interruption insurance we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although we seek to minimize these risks through controls and back up data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with key suppliers and providers of market data  we would not be able to provide our services to our customers 
we depend on key suppliers for the data we provide to our customers 
some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and cannot be obtained from other suppliers 
in other cases  although the data may be available from secondary sources  the secondary source may not be as adequate or reliable as the primary or preferred source  or we may not be able to obtain replacement data from an alternative supplier without undue cost and expense  if at all 
we generally obtain data via license agreements 
the disruption of any license agreement with a major data supplier  such as the new york stock exchange  could disrupt our operations and lead to an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our inability to maintain relationships with service bureaus and custodian banks would decrease our revenue 
part of our strategy is to serve as a major data supplier to service bureaus and custodian banks and thereby to benefit from the trend of major financial institutions in north america outsourcing their back office operations to such entities 
if this trend shifts or any of these relationships are disrupted or are terminated  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
a decline in activity levels in the securities markets could lower demand for our products and services 
our business is dependent upon the health of the financial markets as well as the financial health of the participants in those markets 
some of the financial data and information market demand is dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets while other demand is static and is not dependent on activity levels 
in the event that the us or international financial markets suffer a prolonged downturn that results in a significant decline in investor activity  our revenue levels could be adversely affected 
we have experienced higher than normal cancellations or downgrades as a result of the cost cutting pressures evident in the financial services sector in recent years and such cancellations or downgrades may continue 
consolidation of financial services within and across industries could lower demand for our products and services 
as consolidation occurs and synergies are achieved  the number of potential customers for our products and services decreases 
this consolidation has two forms consolidations within an industry  such as banking  and across industries  such as consolidations of insurance  banking and brokerage companies 
when two companies that separately subscribe to or use our products and services combine  they may terminate or reduce duplicative subscriptions for our products and services or if they are billed on a usage basis  usage may decline due to synergies created by the business combination 
we have experienced higher than normal cancellations as a result of this trend in recent years and these consolidations and cancellations may continue 
a large number of cancellations  or lower utilization resulting from consolidations  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
new product offerings by competitors or new technologies could cause our products or services to become obsolete 
we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new products  services  data content and coverage enhancements and evolving industry standards 
without timely introduction of new products  services and data content and coverage enhancements  our products and services could become technologically obsolete or inadequate over time  in which case our 
table of contents revenue and operating results would suffer 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and services  to enhance data content and coverage and to introduce new products  services and technologies 
these competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies  changes in the industry and changes in customers requirements than we can 
if we fail to adequately anticipate customers needs and technological trends accurately  we will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market and our ability to compete would be adversely impacted 
further if we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to customers  with acceptable prices and terms  or if any such new products and services are not timely made available  our ability to compete would be adversely impacted 
in both cases our ability to generate revenues could suffer and our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we will need to successfully enhance or add to current products and services in order to effectively expand into new geographic areas 
in addition  new products  services  data content and coverage that we may develop and introduce may not achieve market acceptance  lack of market acceptance would result in lower revenues 
we may fail to derive the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
a significant part of our growth strategy has been and continues to be growth through strategic acquisition 
the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business or assets 
successful integration of a business involves the integration of some or all of the following sales  employees  operating systems  operating procedures and information technology systems 
we may not be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business 
in addition  the process of integrating acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen difficulties 
integrating any newly acquired businesses may require a disproportionate amount of management s attention and financial and other resources and detract from the resources remaining for our pre existing businesses 
further we may not be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of acquired businesses 
finally  we may not fully derive all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  for example  supply cost synergies or reduced operating costs due to centralized or shared technical infrastructure 
we provide services to financial institutions that are subject to significant regulatory oversight and any investigation of us or our clients relating to our services could be expensive  time consuming and harm our reputation 
the securities laws and other regulations that govern our activities and the activities of our clients are complex 
compliance with these regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies  including the sec  state authorities and other governmental entities both in the united states and foreign countries 
any investigation by a regulatory agency of one of our clients or us  whether or not founded  could cause us to incur substantial costs and distract our management from our business 
to the extent any of our customers become the subject of a regulatory investigation or a civil lawsuit due to actual or alleged violations of one or more of their regulatory obligations  we could become subject to intense scrutiny 
the intense scrutiny could involve an examination of whether the services we provided to the customer during the time period of the alleged violation were related to or had contributed in any manner to the commission of the violation 
we may be required to expend a significant amount of resources explaining and or defending the services we provided 
in addition  the negative publicity associated with any public investigation could adversely affect our ability to retain current clients and attract new clients 
our ft interactive data subsidiary is a registered investment advisory and is subject to significant regulatory obligations 
the securities laws and other regulations that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex 
these regulations are issued by federal agencies  including the sec  state authorities and other governmental entities both in the united states and foreign countries 
if we were to ever lose our investment advisor status  we could no longer operate those portions of our business that require us to qualify as an investment advisor 
recently  the financial services industry  and in particular the mutual fund industry  has received negative publicity  which has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation 
as the regulatory obligations applicable to investment advisors increase our compliance costs likewise increase 
there are currently several pending proposals for new compliance rules and procedures and  in addition  in this era of heightened scrutiny  we are devoting additional resource to compliance 
the inability to provide one or more of our services would adversely impact revenues and could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operation 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business 
we do not have employment agreements with any of 
table of contents our key personnel  and we may not be able to retain the services of our key personnel 
our ability to replace any key personnel who resigns may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of senior individuals in the financial information industry with the breadth of skills and experiences required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours or perform some of the key business functions we require 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may not be able to hire or retain these personnel 
pearson plc has the ability to control us 
pearson plc directly or indirectly holds approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock 
accordingly  pearson has the ability to exert significant influence over our management and our affairs  including the ability to elect all of the directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate actions submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
the foregoing discussion of risks  uncertainties  and assumptions is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our results of operation and our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries and branches 
we have operations in europe  primarily the united kingdom and operations in asia located in australia  hong kong and singapore with the primary operations in australia 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in international markets where it transacts business in foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may impact the translation of foreign statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect our consolidated statements of operations 
our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks rest with the uk sterling to us dollar exchange rate due to the significant size of our operations in the united kingdom 
the revenues for the past three years and assets for the past two years  by geographic region  is as follows revenues europe asia total long lived assets europe asia total we do not enter into any hedging or derivative arrangements and we do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for investment or other purposes 
we currently invest excess cash balances in money market accounts 
these accounts are largely invested in us government obligations and investment grade commercial paper  accordingly  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonable near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows will not be material
