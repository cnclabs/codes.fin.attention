item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results for were driven by the execution of integrated strategies  including improved food  promotions backed by effective advertising  meeting our guests desires for more convenience  our focus on operations excellence and the retention of better people 
we completed the rollout of our carside to go tm program in all company restaurants in november where practicable and our franchisees will continue implementation during we expect carside to go tm to be a significant driver of sales and traffic growth in our revenues are generated from three primary sources o company restaurant sales food and beverage sales o franchise royalties and fees o other franchise income beverage sales consist of sales of alcoholic beverages  while non alcoholic beverages are included in food sales 
franchise royalties are generally of each franchise restaurant s monthly gross sales 
franchise fees typically range from  to  for each restaurant opened 
other franchise income includes insurance premiums from franchisee participation in our captive insurance company and revenue from information technology products and services provided to certain franchisees 
comparable restaurant sales are based upon those restaurants open for at least months and are compared from period to period 
certain expenses relate only to company operated restaurants 
these include o food and beverage costs o labor costs o direct and occupancy costs o pre opening expenses cost of other franchise income includes the costs related to franchisee participation in our captive insurance company and costs related to information technology products and services provided to certain franchisees 
other expenses  such as general and administrative and amortization expenses  relate to both company operated restaurants and franchise operations 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
our fiscal years ended december   december  and december  each contained weeks and are referred to hereafter as  and  respectively 
on september   we formed neighborhood insurance  inc  a vermont corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary  as a captive insurance company 
neighborhood insurance  inc was established to provide applebee s international  inc and qualified franchisees with workers compensation and general liability insurance 
applebee s international  inc and covered franchisees make premium payments to the captive insurance company which pays administrative fees and insurance claims  subject to individual and aggregate maximum claim limits under the captive insurance company s reinsurance policies 
franchisee premium amounts billed by the captive insurance company are established based upon third party actuarial estimates of ultimate settlement costs for incurred claims and administrative fees 
the franchisee premiums are included in other franchise income ratably over the policy year 
the related offsetting expenses are included in cost of other franchise income 
accordingly  we do not expect franchisee participation in the captive insurance company to have a material impact on our net earnings 
as of december  we have included in our consolidated balance sheet approximately  of assets restricted for the payment of claims  held primarily in cash equivalent investments  and approximately  of other restricted assets 
in addition  we have recorded current liabilities of approximately  in loss and premium reserves related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
franchise revenues franchise revenues consist of franchise royalties  franchise fees and other franchise income 
we recognize royalties on a franchisee s sales in the period in which the sales are reported to have occurred 
we also receive a franchise fee for each restaurant that a franchisee opens 
the recognition of franchise fees is deferred until we have performed substantially all of our related obligations as franchisor  typically when the restaurant opens 
other franchise income includes insurance premiums from franchisee participation in our captive insurance company and revenue from information technology products and services provided to certain franchisees 
income from franchise premiums and information technology services is recognized ratably over the related contract period 
income from information technology products is recognized when the products are installed at the restaurant 
property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations 
we periodically review the assets for changes in circumstances which may impact their useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review property and equipment for impairment on a restaurant by restaurant basis using historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows and or appraisals 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
in addition  we periodically assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to make assumptions regarding the future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
legal and insurance reserves we are periodically involved in various legal actions 
we are required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of loss 
we determine the required accruals after a review of the facts of each legal action 
we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
employee incentive compensation plans we have various long term employee incentive compensation plans which require us to make estimates to determine our liability based upon projected performance of plan criteria 
if actual performance against the criteria differs from our estimates in the future  we will be required to adjust our liability accordingly 
receivables we continually assess the collectibility of our franchise receivables 
we establish our allowance for bad debts based on several factors  including historical collection experience  the current economic environment and other specific information available to us at the time 
the allowance for bad debts may change in the future due to changes in the factors above or other developments 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings and the related asset or liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
acquisitions on november   we acquired the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in the washington  dc area from a franchisee

liquidity and capital resources our need for capital historically has resulted from the construction and acquisition of restaurants  the repurchase of our common shares and investment in information technology systems 
in the past  we have obtained capital through public stock offerings  debt financing  and our ongoing operations 
cash flows from our ongoing operations include cash generated from company and franchise operations  credit from trade suppliers  real estate lease financing  and landlord contributions to leasehold improvements 
we have also used our common stock as consideration in the acquisition of restaurants 
in addition  we have assumed debt or issued new debt in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
capital expenditures were  in excluding the acquisition of restaurants and  in excluding the acquisition of restaurants 
we currently expect to open at least company restaurants  and capital expenditures excluding acquisitions are expected to be between  and  in these expenditures will primarily be for the development of new restaurants  refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants  and the enhancement of information systems 
because we expect to continue to purchase a portion of our sites  the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of leased versus owned properties 
in addition  if we open more restaurants than we currently anticipate or acquire additional restaurants  our capital requirements will increase accordingly 
on november   we acquired the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in the washington  dc area from a franchisee 
under the terms of the purchase agreement and the agreement with the franchisee s secured lender  the total purchase price of the acquisition was  the agreement also provides for additional consideration in july if the restaurants achieve cash flows in excess of historical levels

on july   we completed the sale of eight company restaurants in the atlanta  georgia market to an affiliate of an existing franchisee for  and recognized an immaterial gain in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in connection with the sale of these restaurants  we closed one restaurant in the atlanta market in june this transaction did not have a significant impact on our net earnings for fiscal our bank credit agreement  as amended  expires in november of and provides for a  unsecured revolving credit facility  of which  may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is subject to various covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of stipulated fixed charge  leverage and indebtedness to capitalization ratios  as defined  and limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts 
cash dividends are limited to  annually 
the facility is subject to standard other terms  conditions  covenants  and fees 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement 
as of december   we had borrowings of  and had standby letters of credit of  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of for an aggregate cost of  in december  our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of  of our common stock 
as of december   we had  remaining under these authorizations 
as of december   our liquid assets totaled  these assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of  and short term investments in the amount of  the working capital deficit increased from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in the loss reserve and unearned premiums related to the captive insurance subsidiary and increases in accrued bonuses and accounts payable and was partially offset by increases in inventories and receivables 
we believe that our liquid assets and cash generated from operations  combined with borrowings available under our credit facilities  will provide sufficient funds for our operating  capital and other requirements for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows our debt amortization schedule  future capital lease commitments including principal and interest payments  future operating lease commitments and future purchase obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period certain less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt excluding capital lease obligations    capital lease obligations     operating leases      purchase obligations company      purchase obligations franchise      the amounts for company purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies  severance and employment agreements  and other miscellaneous commitments 
the amounts for franchise purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies made by applebee s international  inc for our franchisees 
applebee s international  inc contracts with certain suppliers to ensure competitive pricing 
these amounts will only be payable by applebee s international  inc if our franchisees do not meet certain minimum contractual requirements 
other contractual obligations we have outstanding lease guarantees of approximately  as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees as of december  or december we have severance and employment agreements with certain officers and other senior executives providing for severance payments to be made in the event the employee resigns or is terminated related to a change in control 
the agreements define the circumstances which will constitute a change in control 
if the severance payments had been due as of december   we would have been required to make payments totaling approximately  in addition  we have severance and employment agreements with certain officers which contain severance provisions not related to a change in control 
those provisions would have required aggregate payments of approximately  if such officers had been terminated as of december  on november   we acquired the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in the washington  dc area from a franchisee 
the purchase agreement provides for additional consideration in july if the restaurants achieve cash flows in excess of historical levels 
the amount of additional payments  if any  under this agreement will not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
in particular  increases in food  supplies  labor and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past three years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
the federal government continues to consider an increase in the minimum wage 
several state governments have increased the minimum wage and other state governments are also considering an increased minimum wage 
in the past  we have been able to pass along cost increases to customers through food and beverage price increases  and we will attempt to do so in the future 
we cannot guarantee  however  that all future cost increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without at least somewhat diminishing customer spending in our restaurants

this interpretation is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  for those companies that have yet to adopt the provisions of fin we are currently assessing fin r and  although we have not completed our analysis  we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section regarding restaurant development  capital expenditures and financial commitments are forward looking and based on current expectations 
there are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described 
these risks include but are not limited to our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open and operate additional restaurants profitably  the ability of our franchisees to obtain financing  the continued growth of our franchisees  our ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees  the impact of intense competition in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry  and our ability to control restaurant operating costs which are impacted by market changes  minimum wage and other employment laws  food costs and inflation

as of december   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was  a change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year 
we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings 
many of the food products we purchase are subject to price volatility due to factors that are outside of our control such as weather and seasonality 
as part of our strategy to moderate this volatility  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments
