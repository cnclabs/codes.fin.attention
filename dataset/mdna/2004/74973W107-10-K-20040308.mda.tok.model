overview rti international metals  inc conducts its operations in two segments the titanium group and the fabrication distribution group 
the titanium group  with primary operations in niles  ohio and canton  ohio  has overall responsibility for the production of primary mill products including  but not limited to  bloom  billet  sheet and plate 
this group also focuses on the research and development of evolving technologies relating to raw materials  melting and other production processes and the application of titanium in new markets 
f d  with operations located throughout the us and europe and representative offices in germany  italy and china  concentrates its efforts on maximizing its profitability by offering value added products and services such as engineered tubulars and extrusions  sub assemblies and fabricated components as well as engineered systems for energy related markets  accessing the titanium group as its primary source of mill product 
approximately of the titanium group s sales in were to f d 
while of rti s sales in are directed to the commercial aerospace market  approximately of all us titanium production is consumed by this segment 
with the continued depressed state of this sector  in conjunction with a substantial amount of under utilized plant capacity  a depressed level of prices has resulted across other markets  including defense and industrial and consumer 
an agreement with the united steelworkers of america uswa expired on october  at the company s niles ohio facility where the union represents hourly and clerical workers 
after two extensions and a union rejection vote on october  a work stoppage commenced and non represented employees began operating the facility 
non represented employees have continued to operate the facility since the work stoppage  and will continue to do so until conditions or circumstances change 
the diversification offered by f d has allowed management to de emphasize commodity titanium products and move the company up the value chain  as well as pursue growth opportunities through acquisitions 
supply chain management is a capability that is becoming more important in f d s targeted markets and rti intends to enhance this core competency 
much of the deployed capital within rti relates to inventory  primarily work in process  necessitated by the nature of processing titanium to demanding metallurgical and physical specifications 
however  significant investments in raw materials  such as titanium sponge and master alloys  have also been made in order to insure uninterrupted supply and to accommodate surges in demand 
as a result  management has put in place various goals aimed at optimizing inventory levels  thereby freeing cash resources to be invested in other areas of the company 
in conjunction with the close monitoring of our working capital position  an emphasis is also made on capital expenditures 
it is not the intent of management to match these with depreciation expense but rather identify those opportunities that will result in the highest return to our shareholders 
over the past few years  capital outlays have been less than depreciation and  thus  have caused a net increase in rti s cash position  which stood at million at year end as for the ultimate disposition of this cash  the rti board of directors regularly considers such options as dividends  stock repurchases in excess of an approved million program  acquisitions or strategic combinations 
given the uncertainty and competitive pressures in the current marketplace  as well as the company s growth strategy  management believes that a net cash position with no long term debt is currently the most desirable capital structure 
results of operations years ended december    and dollars in millions net sales year ended december  net sales sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december  compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of titanium group net sales decreased as a result of a decrease in mill product shipments  partially offset by higher average realized prices as product mix shifted to higher value added flat rolled products 
shipments of titanium mill products were million pounds in the year ended december   compared to million pounds for the same period in  a decrease 
mill product shipments in the year ended december  were lower than those in as demand for forged mill products for commercial aerospace markets declined 
included in mill product shipments are intersegment shipments from the titanium group to the fabrication distribution group 
shipments to f d decreased over the same period last year reflecting reduced demand for titanium products through f d as well as inventory reductions within certain f d businesses 
average realized prices on mill products for the year ended december  increased to per pound from per pound in the increase in average realized prices for mill products resulted primarily from an increased mix of higher value added flat rolled mill products when compared to sales for f d amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december   compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in demand from commercial aerospace in the united states and europe 
sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december  compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of shipments of titanium mill products were million pounds in the year ended december   compared to million pounds in  a decrease 
mill product shipments in the year ended december  were lower than those in as commercial aerospace demand for forged mill products declined 
average realized prices on mill products for the year ended december  increased to per pound from per pound in the increase in average realized prices for mill products resulted primarily from a decreased mix of lower value added forged mill products when compared to sales for f d amounted to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the year ended december   compared to million  including intercompany sales of million  in the same period of this decrease primarily reflects reduced demand in distribution sales in the united states and europe  partially offset by an increase in energy market sales 
in the case of the company s distribution businesses  sales decreased approximately million  due to the general decline in the commercial aerospace industry  while the company s energy business reflected a million increase due to growth in deep water oil and gas exploration 
gross profit year ended december  gross profit gross profit percent the reduction in gross profit for from was a result of a decrease in titanium mill product shipments from million pounds in to million pounds in  a decrease 
the reduced titanium shipment requirements necessitated temporary production outages as the company s niles  ohio facility maintained inventory balances in line with lower shipment levels 
the decline in shipments occurred primarily in heavy shapes as demand for these products from forging companies for use in commercial aircraft and certain industrial applications fell 
the company s f d group was adversely impacted by a decrease in gross margin in from as the group s energy business in concluded work on a major project that provided significantly higher margins to results 
the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to is primarily due to the titanium group cost reduction efforts  increased sales in energy markets  and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  partially offset by reduced volume in domestic and european distribution sales 
the titanium group s results in included a cost reduction of million from its duty drawback program see note to the company s financial statements  u 
s 
customs recovery other current assets 
the program only nominally affected results for selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses percent of sales the decrease for the year ended december  compared to is comprised of several items 
the most significant of these items was due to a million change in classification in of depreciation expense to cost of goods sold from selling  general and administrative expense 
the decrease also reflects a million reduction in bad debt expense as reflected amounts expensed to attain an appropriate allowance 
the remainder of the decrease reflects the impact of cost reduction efforts including reductions in personnel and related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were relatively unchanged from the prior year as the company managed to control costs 
research  technical and product development expenses year ended december  research  technical and product development expense percent of sales research  technical and product development expenses for the year ended december  were slightly reduced from research  technical and product development expenses in were less than in due to a reduction in amounts spent on research and development for the energy market products 
other operating income year ended december  other operating income percent of sales other operating income for the year ended december  consists of a million gain on the sale of one of the company s ashtabula  ohio facilities in the second quarter of that in recent years had been used only for storage of raw materials 
operating loss income year ended december  operating loss income percent of sales operating income for the year ended december  was materially lower than due to a decrease in operating income from the titanium group  from million of income in to a loss of million in the change reflects a decrease in mill product shipments due to a decline in forged mill products demand from the commercial aerospace market  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of one of the company s ashtabula  ohio facilities that in recent years had only been used for storage of raw materials 
this decrease is also due to a decrease in operating income in f d  from million in to million in  primarily as a result of weak demand for the group s products sold to the commercial aerospace market 
the reduction in f d operating income also reflects a decline in profitability from energy markets when compared to principally due to timing of completion of long term orders 
the increase in operating income for the year ended december  compared to consists of an increase in operating income from the titanium group from million in to million in  primarily due to cost reduction efforts 
f d incurred a decrease in operating income  from million in to million in  due to a decrease in demand in domestic and european distribution sales from the general decline in the commercial aerospace industry  partially offset by an increase in energy market sales  due to growth in deep water oil and gas exploration  and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of sfas no 
other income year ended december  other income percent of sales other income for the year ended december  reflects the receipt of liquidated damages from the boeing airplane group of million in in  other income reflects a similar receipt of million 
the long term agreement between rti and boeing expired december  the company expects to receive approximately million from boeing for the year short fall by the end of the first quarter also reflects a million gain from the receipt of a common stock distribution in connection with the demutualization of one of the company s insurance carriers 
the remainder of the change in other income from to consists primarily of lower losses on disposals of other assets and increases in foreign exchange gains 
other income for the year ended december  included a gain of million on the sale of shares in  that were received by the company in as a result of the demutualization of one of its insurance carriers in which it was a participant  compared to million on the initial receipt of those shares in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amount received from boeing in liquidated damages from million in to million in the remainder of the change in other income from to consists primarily of an increase in losses on disposals of other assets and increases in foreign exchange gains

outlook overview weak us and global economies  the terrorist attacks of september   the ongoing conflicts in the middle east  and the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars had and will continue to have significant adverse effects on the overall titanium industry 
according to the us geological survey  us shipments of titanium mill products have declined from a high of approximately million pounds in to approximately million pounds in shipment levels in are expected to be similar to the following is a discussion of what is happening within each of the three major markets in which rti participates 
commercial aerospace markets aerospace demand is classified into two sectors commercial aerospace and defense programs 
demand from these two sectors comprises approximately of the worldwide consumption for titanium products and in the us comprises in excess of of titanium consumption 
the events surrounding september   as well as the middle east conflict and the outbreak of sars severely affected the commercial aerospace market 
airline operators experienced a dramatic drop in travel resulting in significant losses within the airline industry  necessitating cancellation of and reduced requirements for new aircraft 
the company s sales to this market represented of total sales in  down from in following the drop in aircraft demand  boeing and airbus have continued to reduce their build rates for aircraft  including an aggregate cutback in their combined build rate for large commercial aircraft for is currently expected to be down slightly at planes 
an increase in commercial aerospace activity is not expected before airbus has announced the launch of a large widebody aircraft  the a  and boeing is expected to launch a new aircraft  the e  both of which use large quantities of titanium  in the second half of this decade 
longer term  the commercial aerospace sector is expected to continue to be a very significant consumer of titanium products due to the expected long term growth of worldwide traffic and the need to repair and replace aging commercial fleets over the next years 
titanium mill products that are ordered by the prime aircraft producers and their subcontractors are generally ordered in advance of final aircraft production by six to eighteen months 
this is due to the time it takes to produce a final assembly or part that is ready for installation in an airframe or jet engine 
given reduced activity by aircraft builders  shipments from rti to this market sector was reduced in the effect of the reduction in commercial aircraft demand on rti has been partially mitigated by the long term agreement rmi entered into with boeing on january  under this agreement  rmi supplies boeing and its family of commercial suppliers with up to million pounds of titanium products annually 
the agreement  which began in  had an initial term of five years and concluded at the end of under the accord  boeing received firm prices in exchange for rmi receiving a minimum volume commitment of million pounds per year 
if volumes fell short of the minimum commitment  the contract contains provisions for financial compensation 
in accordance with the agreement  and as a result of volume shortfalls in   and  boeing settled claims of approximately million in both and and million in the claim for was settled during the first quarter of for approximately million 
boeing ordered million pounds in  the final year of the contract  and accordingly  the company expects a payment of approximately million in early when boeing satisfies the final claim under the contract 
beginning in january of  business between the companies not covered by other contracts is being conducted on a non committed basis  that is  no volume commitment by boeing and no commitment of capacity or price by rmi 
rti  through its rti europe subsidiary  entered into an agreement with the european aeronautic defense and space company eads in april to supply value added titanium products and parts to the eads group of companies  including airbus 
the contract is in place through  subject to extension 
the new airbus a is expected to utilize more titanium per aircraft than any commercial plane that has ever been produced 
in  airbus became the world s largest producer of commercial aircraft 
with sars apparently under control and industry forecasters projecting increases in future commercial air traffic  the company is optimistic that the commercial aerospace market is at or near the bottom of this decline 
in august   speednews reported that the international civil aviation organization icao expected world airline traffic to increase in and in traditionally  as traffic increases  airlines become more profitable and order new airplanes 
however  it must be noted that due to production lead times any improvements in the orders of planes will take some time to be reflected in shipments of titanium 
additionally  a number of planes taken out of service by the airlines during this downturn are likely to be returned 
for this reason  the company does not anticipate any significant improvement in this market for the next twelve to eighteen months 
defense markets shipments to military markets represented approximately of the company s revenues and are expected to increase as a percent of total sales in as us and other countries defense budgets increase 
this expected increase is due in part to the events of september  and the ongoing conflicts in the middle east 
in fact  the latest us department of defense budget figures for research  development testing and evaluation rdt e and procurement reflect an increase of from through rti believes it is well positioned to supply mill products and fabrications required for any increase in demand from this market 
rti currently supplies titanium and other materials to most military aerospace programs  including the f a  c  f a  f  f  joint strike fighter jsf f and in europe  the mirage  rafale and eurofighter typhoon 
a positive development in this market was that the company was chosen by bae systems ro defence uk to supply the titanium components for the new xm lightweight mm howitzer 
delivery began late in and will continue through initial deliveries will be to the us marine corps  followed by deliveries to the us army and the italian and british armed forces 
it is anticipated that over  guns may be produced 
sales under this contract could potentially exceed million 
another positive development in this market was that lockheed martin  a major customer of the company  was awarded the largest military contract ever on october   for the military s billion jsf program 
the aircraft  which will be used by all branches of the military  is expected to consume  to  pounds of titanium per airplane 
timing and order patterns  which are likely to extend well into the future for this program  have not been quantified  but may be as many as  to  planes over the next to years 
the company has entered into agreements with lockheed and its teaming partner  bae systems  to be the supplier of titanium sheet and plate for the design and development phase of the program over the next five years 
despite the forecasted increases in the defense market  it is not expected to completely offset the effects of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market 
industrial and consumer markets of rti s revenues were generated in various industrial and consumer markets where business conditions are expected to be mixed over the next twelve months 
revenues from oil and gas markets are expected to increase in and beyond  due to continued activity in deep water projects predicted over the next several years 
despite the weak economy  the company believes that deep water oil and gas exploration will continue at a strong pace for the next several years  at least in part due to increased demand for energy 
in april  rti energy systems was selected by unocal to provide production riser equipment in connection with their west seno project off the coast of indonesia 
rti provided high fatigue riser engineering design  in addition to the manufactured components using a combination of titanium and steel 
this project  which was completed in the first quarter of  is expected to lead to other opportunities in indonesia over the next several years 
in addition to the growing applications in energy extraction  rti serves a number of other industrial and consumer markets through its distribution businesses 
the products sold and applications served are numerous and varied 
the resulting diversity tends to provide sales stability through varying market conditions  so the company expects little overall change in sales and profitability from this sector of rti s business over the next twelve months 
the weak economy in recent years has negatively affected other rti industrial and consumer markets  such as chemical processing  power generation and pulp and paper 
however  the company believes demand from these markets will improve in and beyond as economic conditions continue to show improvement 
backlog the company s order backlog for all markets decreased to million as of december   from million at december   principally in energy market related orders due to the timing of receipt of new and the completion of existing long term orders as well as the general decline in demand from the commercial aerospace industry 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions the company believes it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund operations and capital expenditures in in addition  rti has cash reserves and available borrowing capacity to maintain adequate liquidity 
rti currently has no debt  and based on the expected strength of cash flows  the company does not believe there are any material near term risks related to fluctuations in interest rates 
cash provided by operating activities year ended december  cash provided by operating activities the decrease in net cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects a decrease in net income of million due to a decline in business operating results as mentioned in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis 
the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from reductions in working capital and other balance sheet line items 
the most significant items driving the decrease in cash generated from changes in working capital and other balance sheet line items when comparing to are accounts receivable  inventory and the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
changes in accounts receivable generated cash as cash collections exceeded billings in both and the decrease in billings reflected the general decline in the commercial aerospace industry  though the decrease was greater in changes in inventory levels also generated cash as the value of shipments exceeded purchases in both and  as a result of management s efforts to match inventory levels to the decline in business  though the decrease was again greater in changes in the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings generated more cash in than in as it increased due to the company s receipt of cash payments in advance of work completed on additional long term orders 
the increase in net cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in net income of million due to improved business operating results as mentioned in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash generated from reductions in working capital and other balance sheet line items 
the most significant items driving the increase in cash generated from changes in working capital and other balance sheet line items when comparing to are accounts receivable  inventory and the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
changes in accounts receivable generated cash as cash collections exceeded billings in the decrease in billings reflected the general decline in the commercial aerospace industry 
this compares to an increase in accounts receivable balances as of the end of changes in inventory levels also generated cash as the value of shipments exceeded purchases in both and  as a result of management s efforts to match inventory levels to the decline in business  though the decrease was greater in changes in the liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings generated less cash in than in as it decreased due primarily to the company fulfilling obligations and recognizing revenue relating to advanced payments on long term orders 
this compares to an increase in this liability as of the end of the company s working capital ratio was and to at december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities year ended december  cash used in investing activities gross capital expenditures for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million in and million in in all periods  capital spending primarily reflected equipment additions and improvements as well as information systems projects 
partially offsetting the capital expenditures in were proceeds of million relating to the sale of one of the company s ashtabula  ohio facilities 
during the years ended december   and  the company s cash flow requirements for capital expenditures were funded with cash provided by operations 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for will total approximately million and will be funded with cash generated by operations 
at december   the company had a borrowing capacity equal to million 
cash provided by used in financing activities year ended december  cash provided by used in financing activities the favorable change in cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million in the cash used in also reflects a million expenditure related to administrative fees the company incurred when it entered into its revolving credit facility in april of the favorable change in cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to a million repayment of debt in related to the company s revolving credit facility 
on september   rti filed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration permits rti to issue up to million of debt and or equity securities at an unspecified future date 
the proceeds of any such issuance could be utilized to finance acquisitions  capital investments or other general purposes  however  rti has not issued any securities to date and has no immediate plans to do so 
contractual obligations  commitments and post retirement benefits following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total operating leases       capital leases total contractual obligations       commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period thereafter total long term supply agreements      purchase obligations   standby letters of credit    total commercial commitments      post retirement benefits thereafter total post retirement benefits        see note to the company s financial statements 
see note to the company s financial statements 
amounts represent commitments for which contractual terms exceed twelve months 
amounts primarily represent purchase commitments under purchase orders 
amounts represent standby letters of credit primarily related to commercial performance and insurance guarantees 
the company does not fund its other post retirement employee benefits obligation but instead pays amounts when incurred 
however  these estimates are based on current benefit plan coverage and are not contractual commitments in as much as the company retains the right to modify  reduce  or terminate any such coverage in the future 
amounts shown in the years through are based on actuarial estimates of expected future cash payments 
the company is not forecasting or required to make a pension contribution in as in past years  the company may make voluntary contributions when there is an economic advantage to contribute to the fund 
future contributions to the fund  if required  will be provided based on actuarial evaluation 
credit agreement at december   the company maintained a credit agreement entered into on april   which provides a million three year unsecured revolving credit facility 
this agreement replaced the previously existing million five year unsecured revolving credit facility entered into september  the company can borrow up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory 
under the terms of the facility  the company  at its option  will be able to borrow at a a base rate which is the higher of pnc bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  or b libor plus a spread ranging from to determined by the ratio of the company s consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit agreement contains restrictions  among others  on the minimum shareholders equity required  the minimum cash flow required  and the maximum leverage ratio permitted 
at december   there was million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the facility  the company was in compliance with all covenants  and had a borrowing capacity equal to million 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations as well as various health and safety laws and regulations that are subject to frequent modifications and revisions 
during the years ended december   and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmental remediation  compliance  and related services 
the company estimates environmental related expenditures  including capital items and compliance costs  will total approximately million annually for and while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the company continues to evaluate its obligations for environmental related costs on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments in accordance with provisions of statement of position no 
 environmental remediation liabilities 
the company is involved in investigative or cleanup projects under federal or state environmental laws at a number of waste disposal sites  including the fields brook superfund site and the ashtabula river area of concern 
given the status of the proceedings with respect to these sites  ultimate investigative and remediation costs cannot presently be accurately predicted  but could  in the aggregate be material 
based on the information available regarding the current ranges of estimated remediation costs at currently active sites  and what the company believes will be its ultimate share of such costs  provisions for environmental related costs have been recorded 
given the status of the proceedings at certain of these sites  and the evolving nature of environmental laws  regulations  and remediation techniques  the company s ultimate obligation for investigative and remediation costs cannot be predicted 
it is the company s policy to recognize environmental costs in its financial statements when an obligation becomes probable and a reasonable estimate of exposure can be determined 
at december  and  the amount accrued for future environmental related costs was million 
of the total amount accrued at december   million is expected to be paid out during and is included in the other accrued liabilities line of the balance sheet 
the remaining million is recorded in other non current liabilities 
based on available information  rmi believes that its share of potential environmental related costs  before expected contributions form third parties  is in a range from to million in the aggregate 
the amount accrued is net of expected contributions from third parties in a range from to million  which the company believes are probable 
these third parties include prior owners of rmi property and prior customers of rmi  that have agreed to partially reimburse the company for certain environmental related costs 
the company has been receiving contributions from such third parties for a number of years as partial reimbursement for costs incurred by the company 
as these proceedings continue toward final resolution  amounts in excess of those already provided may be necessary to discharge the company from its obligations for these sites 
former ashtabula extrusion plant the company s former extrusion plant in ashtabula  ohio was used to extrude depleted uranium under a contract with the doe from through in accordance with that agreement  the doe retained responsibility for the cleanup of the facility when it was no longer needed for processing government material 
processing ceased in  and in rmi was chosen as the prime contractor for the remediation and restoration of the site by the doe 
since then  contaminated buildings have been removed and approximately two thirds of the site has been free released by the ohio department of health  to rmi  at doe expense 
in december   in accordance with its terms  the department of energy terminated the contract for convenience 
remaining soil removal is expected to take approximately months 
it is not known at this time what role  if any  rmi will play in the balance of the cleanup 
as license holder and owner of the site  rmi is responsible to the state of ohio for complying with soil and water regulations 
however  remaining cleanup cost is expected to be borne by the doe in accordance with their contractual obligation

it also provides guidance related to the initial and subsequent measurement of assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests in newly consolidated variable interest entities and requires disclosures for both the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and other beneficiaries of the entity 
fin must be applied to all entities subject to this interpretation as of march  however  prior to the required application of this interpretation  fin must be applied to those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities as of december  there was no financial statement impact from the application at december  at this time  the company has not completed the assessment of the effects of the application of this interpretation on our financial position or results of operations at march  acquisitions rti continues to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to determine if they are likely to increase the company s earnings and value 
rti evaluates such potential acquisitions on the basis of their ability to enhance or improve the company s existing operations or capabilities  as well as the ability to provide access to new markets and or customers for its products 
rti may make acquisitions using its available cash resources  borrowings under its existing credit facility  new debt financing  the company s common stock  joint venture partnership arrangements or any combination of the above 
critical accounting policies rti s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the amounts recorded for assets and liabilities and resultant revenue and expenses 
management estimates are based on historical evidence and other available information  which in management s opinion provide the most reasonable and likely result under the current facts and circumstances 
under different facts and circumstances expected results may differ materially from the facts and circumstances applied by management 
of the accounting policies described in note of the company s financial statements and others not expressly stated but adopted by management as the most appropriate and reasonable under the current facts and circumstances  the effect upon the company of the policy of goodwill and long term assets  income taxes  employee benefit plans and environmental liabilities would be most critical if management estimates were incorrect 
goodwill 
in the case of goodwill and long term assets  if future product demand or market conditions reduce management s expectation of future cash flows from these assets  a write down of the carrying value of goodwill or long term assets may be required 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on historical and projected financial information 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  and was million or and of total assets  respectively 
management relies on its estimate of cash flow projections using business and economic data available at the time the projection is calculated 
a significant number of assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including overall conditions  sales volumes and prices  costs of production  and working capital changes 
the discounted cash flow evaluation is completed annually in the fourth quarter  absent any events throughout the year which would indicate an impairment 
if an event were to occur that indicates a potential impairment  the company would perform a discounted cash flow evaluation prior to the fourth quarter 
at december  the results of management s assessment did not indicate an impairment 
results of the test in did indicate that the difference between carrying value and discounted cash flows had been reduced from prior years for one of the company s reportable units 
no events occurred during that would indicate a potential impairment exists 
long lived assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of property plant  and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in circumstances may include technological changes  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions  or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other items  our assumptions about the estimated undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment loss 
management applies its best judgement when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flow and the fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
in the case of deferred tax assets  management has provided under current facts and circumstances what it believes to be adequate allowances for reduced value 
similar to goodwill and long term assets  should the future benefit of deferred tax assets become impaired because of the possibility of reduced utilization  an increase to the valuation allowance and corresponding charge to expense may be required 
the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences was million at december  and million at december  the company has not provided a valuation allowance based on its estimate of the full recovery of its deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income considering tax planning strategies for utilizing its tax assets 
deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income or equity  as appropriate  in the period in which the determination were made 
employee benefit plans 
included in the company s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans are assumptions on future discount rates  expected return on assets and rate of future compensation changes 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  as well as longer term assumptions in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  the company s liability increases as the discount rate decreases and decreases as the discount rate increases 
the company considers a variety of sources that provide rates on high quality aaa aa corporate bonds and other sources in order to select a discount rate that best matches its pension investment profile 
the company reduced its discount rate at december  and to determine its future benefit obligation 
the discount rate at december  was and at december  was 
decreases in the level of plan assets have a direct impact on the amount of periodic pension expense the company records 
during the value of the company s plan assets increased as improved returns occurred particularly on equities held by the fund 
the company assumed an expected rate of return to record expense during  which represented a decrease from in for the company has chosen to maintain the rate of return used in or at december   the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to plan assets exceeded the value of those assets 
the reduction in the discount rate from to partially offset by the improvement in asset returns resulted in a nominal adjustment to equity to reflect an increase in the additional minimum liability of  net of deferred taxes 
pension expense in will increase  in the company currently does not have any minimum funding obligations under erisa but continually evaluates whether the best use of its cash may include a contribution to the pension plans 
if the company chooses to make a contribution prior to the funding deadline  the increase in pension expense for will likely decrease 
environmental liabilities 
the company provides for environmental liabilities when these liabilities become probable and can be reasonably determined 
the company regularly evaluates and assesses its environmental responsibilities 
should facts and circumstances indicate that a liability exists or that previously evaluated and assessed liabilities have changed  the company will record the liability or adjust the amount of an existing liability
