gentiva s revenues are generated primarily from three major payor sources the us medicare program  medicaid and other state and county programs  and commercial insurers 
revenue mix by major payor classifications are as follows fiscal year medicare medicaid and other government commercial insurance and other the medicare and medicaid and related programs are subject to legislative and other risk factors that can result in fluctuating reimbursement rates for gentiva s direct home health services to patients 
the commercial insurance industry is continually seeking ways to control the cost of services to patients that it covers 
one of the ways it seeks to control costs is to require greater efficiencies from its providers  including home health care companies 
despite these risks  gentiva believes it can operate effectively in the current health care climate by increasing its volume of medicare and commercial insurance business and implementing new business practices  technologies and other methods to make the company an even more efficient provider of services 
in fact  gentiva has made a strategic decision to seek more business from the medicare and commercial insurance payor groups 
for example  in  gentiva s revenue from its medicare and commercial insurance and other payor categories increased percent and percent  respectively  from the prior year 
various states have addressed budget pressures by considering or implementing reductions in various health care programs  including reductions in rates or changes in patient eligibility requirements 
in addition  the company has also decided to taper participation in certain medicaid and other state and county programs 
as a result  gentiva s revenue from this payor category declined percent from the prior year 
gentiva believes that several marketplace factors can contribute to its future growth 
first  the company is a leader in a highly fragmented home health care industry populated by approximately  providers of varying size and resources 
second  the cost of a home health care visit to a patient can be significantly lower than the cost of an average day in a hospital or skilled nursing institution 
and third  the demand for home care is expected to grow  primarily due to an aging us population 
the us centers for medicare and medicaid services projects that national home health and durable medical equipment spending will rise from billion in to billion by the us census bureau has estimated that the age and older population will increase more than percent between and the company expects to capitalize on these positive trends through a determined set of strategies  as follows generate balanced growth by focusing on medicare and commercial insurance business  continue to develop and expand specialty services for incremental revenue growth  focus on caregiver recruitment  retention and productivity  and launch technology initiatives that make gentiva more efficient and profitable 
the company anticipates executing these strategies by continuing to expand its sales presence  developing and marketing its managed care services  making operational improvements and deploying new technologies  providing employees with leadership training and instituting retention initiatives  ensuring strong ethics and corporate governance  and focusing on shareholder value 
results from these strategies and initiatives began to appear in the company s performance 
gentiva reported net revenue of million  representing a million or percent increase from the million reported in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to a rise in the volume of medicare and commercial insurance business mentioned above 
net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  which included a tax benefit of per diluted share related to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance discussed later in this annual report

see item legal proceedings and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
settlement issues prrb appeal as further described in the critical accounting policies below  the company s annual cost reports  which were filed with the cms  were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
in connection with the audit of the company s cost reports  the medicare fiscal intermediary made certain audit adjustments related to the methodology used by the company to allocate a portion of its residual overhead costs 
the company filed cost reports for years subsequent to using the fiscal intermediary s methodology 
the company believed its methodology used to allocate such overhead costs was accurate and consistent with past practice accepted by the fiscal intermediary  as such  the company filed appeals with the provider reimbursement review board prrb concerning this issue with respect to cost reports for the years  and the company s consolidated financial statements for the years  and had reflected use of the methodology mandated by the fiscal intermediary 
in june  the company and its medicare fiscal intermediary signed an administrative resolution relating to the issues covered by the appeals pending before the prrb 
under the terms of the administrative resolution  the fiscal intermediary agreed to reopen and adjust the company s cost reports for the years  and using a modified version of the methodology used by the company prior to this modified methodology will also be applied to cost reports for the year  which are currently under audit 
the administrative resolution required that the process to i reopen all cost reports  ii determine the adjustments to allowable costs through the issuance of notices of program reimbursement nprs and iii make appropriate payments to the company  be completed in early cost reports relating to years subsequent to will be reopened after the process for the cost reports is completed 
on february   the fiscal intermediary notified the company that it had completed the reopening of all cost reports and determined that the adjustment to allowable costs for that year approximated million 
as of february   the majority of the funds relating to this adjustment had been remitted to the company  the settlement amount will be recorded as net revenues during the first quarter of fiscal although the company believes that it could recover additional funds as a result of applying the modified methodology discussed above to cost reports subsequent to  the settlement amounts cannot be specifically determined until the reopening or audit of each year s cost reports is completed 
this is not expected to occur until the second half of fiscal or fiscal however  in view of changes in reimbursement and the company s operations in periods subsequent to  it is likely that future recoveries relating to any cost report year from to will be significantly less than the settlement

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
sfas encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based compensation plans at fair value 
in addition  sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has chosen to adopt the disclosure only provisions of sfas and continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no

goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value 
the company adopted sfas as of the beginning of fiscal the provisions of sfas require that a transitional impairment test be performed as of the beginning of the year the statement is adopted 
based on the results of the transitional impairment tests  the company determined that an impairment loss relating to goodwill had occurred and recorded a non cash charge of million  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  as cumulative effect of accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  the deferred tax benefit was recorded by eliminating a deferred tax liability of million and recording a deferred tax asset of approximately million  offset by an increase in the tax valuation allowance by the same amount 
during fiscal  the company also recorded a tax benefit of approximately million relating to tax deductible goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to the requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including those related to employee termination benefits and obligations under operating leases and other contracts  be recognized when the liability is incurred  and not necessarily the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as under eitf sfas also establishes that the initial measurement of a liability recognized under sfas be based on fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company adopted sfas  effective december  for exit or disposal activities initiated prior to december   the company followed the accounting guidelines outlined in eitf in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
historically  entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin will apply to variable interest entities as of march  for the company 
also  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after december   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  the cost of claims incurred but not reported  obligations under workers compensation  professional liability and employee health and welfare insurance programs and medicare settlement issues 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain government payors  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payors are traditionally one year in term and renewable automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
under capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the services provided 
net revenues generated under capitated agreements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal    respectively 
under the prospective payment system pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recognized under the medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included in other medicare liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
revenue adjustments result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments are deducted from gross accounts receivable 
these revenue adjustments are based on significant assumptions and judgments which are determined by company management based on historical trends 
third party settlements resulting in recoveries are recognized as net revenues in the period in which the funds are received 
collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables  particularly with respect to fee for service arrangements  involves significant assumptions and judgments 
in this regard  the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection  reimbursement experience and billing functions 
cost of claims incurred but not reported under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  the company estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported based on applying actuarial assumptions  historical patterns of utilization to authorized levels of service  current enrollment statistics and other information 
under fee for service arrangements with certain managed care customers  the company also estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported and the estimated revenue relating thereto in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of cost of claims incurred but not reported involves significant assumptions and judgments which relate to and may vary depending on the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers  historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends 
these assumptions and judgments are evaluated on a quarterly basis and changes in estimated liabilities for costs of claims incurred but not reported are determined based on such evaluation 
obligations under insurance programs the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including workers compensation and professional liability and employee health and welfare 
the company may be subject to workers compensation claims and lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims 
the company maintains various insurance programs to cover this risk but is substantially self insured for most of these claims 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these programs in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits  have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  the company s own home health specific historical claims experience  current enrollment statistics and other information 
such estimates and the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically 
for the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded a special charge of million relating primarily to a refinement in the estimation process used to determine the company s actuarially computed workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
management believes that  as a result of this refinement  sufficient data exists to allow the company to more heavily rely on its own home health specific historical claims experience in determining the company s estimates of workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
previously the company utilized insurance industry actuarial information  as well as the company s historical claims experience in developing reserve estimates 
the company maintains insurance coverage on individual claims 
the company is responsible for the cost of individual workers compensation claims and individual professional liability claims up to  per incident which occurred prior to march  and  per incident thereafter 
the company also maintains excess liability coverage relating to professional liability and casualty claims which provides insurance coverage for individual claims of up to  in excess of the underlying coverage limits 
payments under the company s workers compensation program are guaranteed by letters of credit and segregated restricted cash balances 
during the fiscal year  the company segregated million of cash funds in a trust account to replace certain letters of credit and surety bonds 
interest on the funds in the trust account accrues to the company 
the company  at its option  may terminate the trust agreement by providing equivalent amounts of alternative security allowed under the program  including letters of credit and surety bonds 
the company believes that its present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but there can be no assurance that the company will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of its insurance limits 
medicare settlement issues prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home care nursing services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements that exceed established reserves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no interest rate exposure on fixed rate debt or other market risk at december
