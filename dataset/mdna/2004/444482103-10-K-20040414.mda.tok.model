item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial condition as of january   and the results of operations for fiscal years  and this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
business founded in  we are one of the nation s largest diversified wholesale distributors of construction  repair and maintenance related products 
we distribute over  products to more than  customers through our branches located in states 
our customers include electrical  plumbing and mechanical contractors  public utilities  property management companies  municipalities and industrial companies 
although we have a national presence  we operate principally in the southeastern and southwestern united states 
fiscal year our fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last friday in january 
fiscal year and fiscal year contained weeks while fiscal year contained weeks 
the additional week in fiscal year was included in the first quarter 
segment information during the third quarter of fiscal year  we revised our reporting structure to provide additional disclosure by realigning our previously reported operating segments electrical plumbing  industrial pvf and water sewer building materials on a more disaggregated basis by product line into six operating segments and an all other category 
the revised operating segments are water sewer  plumbing hvac  mro  utilities  electrical and industrial pvf 
the all other category includes our building materials  fire protection and mechanical industrial product lines 
the industrial pvf segment remains unchanged 
the corporate category includes corporate level expenses not allocated to our operating segments 
inter segment sales are excluded from net sales presented for each segment 
operating income for each segment includes certain corporate expense allocations for employee benefits  corporate overhead expenses  data processing expenses and property casualty insurance 
these allocations are based on consumption or at a standard rate determined by management 
in connection with the change of our reporting structure and to more accurately reflect consumption  we changed our method of allocating corporate overhead expenses to the segments 
all prior period segment results have been reclassified to reflect these changes 
business combinations and divestitures on december   we acquired century maintenance supply  inc century  a leading distributor of mro products serving the multi family apartment market 
century has a nationwide distribution network of strategically located branches in major metropolitan markets in states 
the acquisition will enable us to become a leader in the apartment mro market and facilitate entry into adjacent customer markets such as hospitality and lodging  assisted living and healthcare  education and government 
century s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of income since december  on august   we acquired substantially all of the net assets of marden susco  llc marden susco  a southern california supplier of underground piping products for use in municipal water  sewer and storm drain systems 
the acquisition allowed us to expand our water sewer business into california 
the results of marden susco s operations have been included in our consolidated statements of income since august  on august   we acquired all of the capital stock of utiliserve holdings  inc and its subsidiaries utiliserve  a wholesale distributor of electrical transmission and distribution products and services to the us electric utility industry 
as a result of the acquisition  we are a leading provider of electrical transmission and distribution products and services in the united states 
we also expanded our development of customer contracts as a result of utiliserve s value added services  including vendor managed inventory  collaborative emergency response  and job site delivery 
the results of utiliserve s operations have been included in our consolidated statements of income since august  page of prior to fiscal year  our plumbing hvac business conducted international operations in mexico 
in fiscal year  we experienced continued operating losses in these international operations 
as a result of these losses and based on an analysis of future profitability and anticipated customer demand for these businesses  we terminated our international operations in fiscal year in fiscal year  we acquired bestroute 
com bestroute 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  bestroute was not able to meet its operating plan and incurred substantial operating losses attributable to its inability to gain market acceptance and generate net sales sufficient to cover its operating costs 
as a result of these continued losses and viability concerns  we discontinued bestroute s operations in march results of operations same store sales methodology we compute and disclose same store sales  which exclude net sales related to a acquired and newly opened branches until operating results are included in the consolidated financial statements for all periods in the current and prior fiscal years  b branch combinations and splits unless within the same segment and physical location and c closed and divested branches 
all same store sales amounts and percentages presented in this report exclude the impact of the additional week of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year overview overall  our performance in fiscal year reflected continued strength in the residential construction market and improvement in the commercial construction industry 
after a slow start in the first half of the year  our business came back strongly in the second half  delivering sales beyond our expectations  particularly in the fourth quarter 
we achieved same store sales growth in fiscal year  our first year of positive same store sales growth since fiscal year gross margin ratio to net sales decreased due to competitive pressures and changes to our product mix  with historically lower gross margin businesses like utilities comprising a higher percentage of our consolidated net sales 
offsetting some of the sell side margin pressure were higher vendor rebates and discounts as a result of our vendor consolidation efforts and improved programs with our suppliers 
performance in fiscal year was hindered by a significant sales and profitability decrease in the industrial pvf segment  our highest operating margin business  as well as underperforming branches in our plumbing hvac segment 
the comparison with fiscal year was also impacted by the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year we experienced higher operating expenses in freight  employee healthcare  marketing and insurance during fiscal year given our fixed cost structure  we will continue to manage expenses carefully to leverage sales 
however  we are also increasing our level of investment spending  particularly in information technology  through various initiatives such as the implementation of our hughes unified distribution platform and new systems in finance and data warehousing 
we continue to maintain a focus on working capital improvement  and as a result  net cash flow provided by operating activities grew to a record million for the year 
initiatives to improve our working capital efficiency to support sales growth will continue and we expect operating cash flow to continue to be strong 
in january  we completed an equity offering of  shares and  used the net proceeds primarily to fund our acquisition of century and to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement 
the equity offering strengthened our capital structure by lowering our total debt to capital ratio to from the previous year s  establishing a stronger foundation to support future organic and acquisition growth 
page of net sales net sales are affected by numerous factors  including  but not limited to  seasonality  weather  commodity pricing  competition and construction cycles 
consolidated and same store net sales by segment in fiscal years  and were as follows dollars in millions consolidated net sales fiscal years ended variance variance to to water sewer plumbing hvac mro utilities electrical industrial pvf all other same store sales fiscal years ended dollar variance variance to water sewer plumbing hvac mro utilities electrical industrial pvf all other same store sales fiscal years ended dollar variance variance to water sewer plumbing hvac mro utilities electrical industrial pvf all other the difference in same store sales amounts for fiscal is due to our same store sales methodology 
see same store sales methodology 
consolidated net sales in fiscal year totaled  million  an increase of million or  compared to fiscal year s net sales of  million due partially to the acquisitions of century  marden susco and utiliserve as well as strong residential construction activity and an improvement in the commercial construction market during the second half of the fiscal year 
the century and marden susco acquisitions added net sales of million and million  respectively  during fiscal year a full year of utiliserve activity in fiscal year increased net sales by million 
these increases  along with an increase in consolidated net sales from newly opened branches of million were partially offset by a decrease of million related to closed and or combined branches and a benefit of million included in fiscal year s consolidated net sales due to the additional week included in its first quarter 
page of in fiscal year  consolidated same store sales increased million or 
this increase was due to the procurement of several large subdivision and municipal projects in the midwestern water and sewer markets  an overall improvement in the commercial construction markets served by the plumbing hvac segment and the building materials product line in the eastern united states  and market share growth in the mro segment 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in the industrial pvf segment due to weak end market demand and the loss of a large utilities segment customer during the second quarter of fiscal year consolidated net sales in fiscal year increased million or compared to fiscal year acquired and newly opened branches accounted for million of the increase 
the majority of net sales for acquired and newly opened branches were attributable to the utilities and water sewer segments  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of this increase 
included in the utilities segment s acquired and newly opened branch sales was million of net sales related to the acquisition of utiliserve 
the additional week included in the first quarter of fiscal year added million of net sales 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline of million or in same store sales largely as a result of a slow down in the non residential building and commercial construction sectors and a decline in industrial pvf sales due to the postponement or cancellation of certain projects 
consolidated net sales from closed and or combined branches also decreased by million 
water sewer net sales in fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
this increase was partially due to the acquisition of marden susco  which resulted in additional net sales of million in fiscal year same store sales increased million or as a result of increased subdivision projects and increased sewer and waterline projects during fiscal year partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease resulting from the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year and a million decrease related to closed and or combined branches 
same store sales increased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to favorable public and residential construction in fiscal year  which increased approximately 
in addition  this segment was awarded several large infrastructure projects  including an automated water meter project for million 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of million in the concrete product line s net sales mainly due to decreased demand in the texas market 
plumbing hvac net sales in fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
this increase was primarily due to sales growth from acquired and newly opened branches of million and same store sales increases of million or due to increased business on several large accounts due to improved market penetration in fiscal year and overall improvement in the commercial plumbing market 
these increases were offset partially by the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year  which added million to fiscal year s net sales as well as a decline of million of net sales related to closed and or combined branches 
same store sales decreased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year largely as a result of competitive pressures in certain local markets  compounded by weak commercial and industrial business 
in addition  same store sales in the texas market were also unfavorably impacted due to inclement weather conditions 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in sales in the plumbing hvac s western region  due in part to the expansion of our customer base 
mro net sales for fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
this increase was partially due to the acquisition of century  which resulted in additional net sales of million in fiscal year same store sales increased million or  and net sales for newly opened branches increased million from the prior year 
despite historically high vacancy rates  net sales increased due to our continued focus on securing national accounts to increase market share and our construction services initiative 
under the national accounts initiative  the mro segment targets large property management companies to become their preferred supplier 
the construction services initiative is geared toward renovation and refurbishment of older apartment complexes 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year  which added million to net sales in fiscal year same store sales increased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to mro s strategic focus on both its national accounts and construction services initiatives 
page of utilities net sales in fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million or compared to the fiscal year s net sales of million 
a full year of utiliserve activity in fiscal year increased net sales by million 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year  which added million to net sales in the prior year 
same store sales decreased million or due primarily to the loss of a large electric utility customer during the second quarter of fiscal year utiliserve s net sales are not reflected in same store sales due to our calculation methodology 
despite a highly competitive market and a general slowdown in the economy  the utilities segment s same store net sales remained relatively flat in both periods with a million or decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this resulted from sales initiatives aimed at providing value added services  such as the installation and testing of automated electric utility meters 
electrical net sales in fiscal year totaled million  a decrease of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
this decrease resulted  in part  from the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year  which added million to net sales in fiscal year  and a decline of million related to closed and or combined branches 
same store sales decreased million or primarily due to weakness in the commercial construction and industrial markets  particularly in office buildings and hotel construction during the first half of fiscal year the economic downturn in these markets experienced over the last three years has placed significant pressure on the electrical distribution industry  however during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  sales and bid activity improved as commercial construction activity increased 
same store sales decreased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year largely as a result of the economic slowdown in the electrical commercial construction market  particularly in the southeast and texas 
competitive pressures in certain local markets  weak commercial  industrial and original equipment manufacturer oem business and inclement weather conditions in the texas market also contributed to the decrease 
industrial pvf net sales in fiscal year totaled million  a decrease of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
contributing to the decrease was million of net sales related to the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year same store sales decreased million or primarily due to the sharp decline in power and petrochemical industry capital spending and new plant construction 
same store sales decreased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease reflected the postponement or cancellation of certain gas utility  petrochemical and power generation plant construction and or rehabilitation projects in late fiscal year and throughout fiscal year these projects were postponed and cancelled by our customers due to economic conditions  which resulted in reduced plant utilization and reduced capital spending 
the same store sales decline was partially offset by increased sales prices for certain commodity based products  including stainless steel and nickel alloys 
all other net sales in fiscal year totaled million  an increase of million or compared to fiscal year s net sales of million 
same store sales increased million or 
the building materials product line benefited from the strong increase in the number and size of construction projects in florida and higher non building construction starts 
the fire protection product line also posted strong sales growth as a result of expansion into new markets and increases in subdivision and waterline projects 
these increases were partially offset by the additional week of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year  which added million to net sales in fiscal year  as well as a decline in net sales of million related to closed and or combined branches 
same store sales decreased million or in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to declines in the building materials and fire protection product lines  which decreased and  respectively 
these decreases were largely attributable to a slowdown in non residential and commercial construction markets particularly in the eastern region for the fire protection product line and the atlanta market for the building materials product line 
page of gross margin gross margin is affected by numerous factors  including  but not limited to  product mix changes  commodity pricing  competition  vendor rebates  inventory charges and direct shipments compared to stock sales 
the decrease in gross margin ratio to net sales to in fiscal year from in fiscal year was driven primarily by competitive pricing pressures and the mix of our net sales activity 
in fiscal year  the utilities segment  which has historically generated lower gross margins than our other segments  comprised a higher percentage of consolidated net sales  and the industrial pvf segment  a higher gross margin business  comprised a lower percentage of consolidated net sales 
additionally an unfavorable margin impact resulting from higher inventory reserve requirements was partially offset by an increase in vendor rebates resulting from our continued vendor consolidation efforts and improved programs with our suppliers 
gross margin ratio to net sales was and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
gross margin ratio to net sales benefited from increased vendor rebates and discounts as a result of our vendor consolidation efforts  and a reduction in inventory reserve requirements attributable to lower dead stock and excess inventory levels 
partially offsetting this improvement was the addition of utiliserve to the sales mix  which generates lower gross margins but higher operating margins than our other segments 
pricing pressures brought about by intensified competition resulting from the slowdown in the non residential and commercial construction sectors and the adverse impact of deflationary pressures on pvc and ductile iron pipe products also unfavorably impacted gross margin ratio to net sales in fiscal year operating expenses we are primarily a fixed cost business  consequently  a percentage change in our net sales has a greater percentage effect on our operating expense ratio 
operating expenses and percentage of net sales for fiscal years  and were as follows dollars in millions operating expenses percentage of net sales fiscal years ended fiscal years ended personnel expenses other selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  personnel expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
our workforce increased from approximately  employees at january  to approximately  employees at january  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of century and marden susco 
century and marden susco added million of personnel expenses to fiscal year  and a full year of utiliserve activity during the year additionally increased personnel expenses by million 
employee healthcare insurance expenses increased million due to increased enrollment and higher rates 
the primary factor contributing to the decrease in personnel expenses as a percentage of net sales was a favorable impact resulting from a change to our employee vacation policy 
under the new vacation policy adopted in fiscal year  employees earn their vacation entitlement ratably during the year 
previously  vacation was granted at the beginning of the calendar year 
this policy change resulted in a net reversal of our vacation accrual of million 
personnel expenses were also favorably impacted by the additional week in fiscal year  which added approximately million to the prior year s first quarter 
as percentage of net sales  other selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel prices  resulting in increased shipping and freight costs of million  a million increase in marketing expenses related to enhanced customer award programs  an increase of million in telecommunications expenses attributable to increased bandwidth capacity  and an insurance expense increase of million due primarily to increased insurance premiums 
fiscal year also included expenses of million primarily for lease obligations related to the closure of seven plumbing hvac branches and our texas distribution center  and million associated with the relocation of our corporate offices 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts due primarily to lower write offs of uncollectible customer accounts and higher recoveries of previously written off receivables 
the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year included million of other selling  general and administrative expenses 
page of as a percentage of net sales  personnel expenses were and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
our workforce remained essentially flat with approximately  employees at january  and january  at january   this included approximately employees as a result of the acquisition of utiliserve  which increased personnel expenses by million in fiscal year the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year also added million of personnel expenses 
the primary factors contributing to the increase in personnel expenses in fiscal year were higher employee health insurance expense million and incentive compensation expense million associated with bonus programs and restricted stock issued to key executives during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by reductions in overtime million  contract labor million and severance expense million 
in fiscal year  we continued with our hiring freeze and wage and salary management programs  which included limits on merit and promotional salary increases 
these savings were offset in fiscal year by incremental personnel costs associated with the hughes unified implementation and increased employee health insurance 
as a percentage of net sales  other selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year added million of other selling  general and administrative expenses 
we experienced higher losses totaling million on our property casualty insurance program and increased data processing expenses of million primarily for consulting related to the hughes unified operating system 
we also made donations of million in fiscal year to hughes supply foundation  inc  a not for profit charitable organization 
offsetting these increases were expenses of million that were incurred in fiscal year  primarily for lease obligations million and other contractual obligations million  related to the closure and or consolidation of branches in fiscal year our provision for doubtful accounts decreased million in fiscal year due to provisions in fiscal year for uncollectible receivables related to our international business 
as a percentage of net sales  depreciation and amortization were and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
of the total million decrease  million related to the amortization of goodwill  which was eliminated in fiscal year under statement of financial accounting standards fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the remaining decrease of million was largely the result of reduced capital spending in fiscal year along with the elimination of depreciation expense related to our forklift fleet and trailers 
certain of these assets were sold and subsequently leased back by us in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to goodwill of one entity in our plumbing hvac segment 
operating income we are primarily a fixed cost business  therefore all operating segments were favorably impacted in fiscal year by the leverage gained from the additional week of net sales 
operating income is affected significantly by fluctuations in net sales as well as changes in our business and product mix 
operating income by segment and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in millions operating income loss fiscal years ended percentage of net sales water sewer plumbing hvac mro utilities electrical industrial pvf all other page of operating income in fiscal year totaled million  increasing million or  compared to fiscal year s operating income of million 
operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year due primarily to a decline in industrial pvf net sales and profitability as a result of the significant downturn in the petrochemical and power industries  and the additional week included in the first quarter of fiscal year  which improved the prior year s operating income leverage by million 
partially offsetting these decreases was operating income from the acquisitions of century and marden susco  which collectively added million of operating income to fiscal year a full year of utiliserve activity in fiscal year also increased operating income million 
operating income in fiscal year totaled million  increasing million or  compared to operating income of million in fiscal year operating income as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the basis points increase was primarily driven by the elimination of million of goodwill amortization  which is no longer required under fas  combined with higher gross margins  which improved basis points in fiscal year since we are primarily a fixed cost business  with the most significant variable expense being cost of sales  operating income for all of our segments was also favorably impacted by the additional week in fiscal year  which added approximately million of operating income 
water sewer operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the basis points increase in fiscal year was due primarily to increased sales volume and stable margins on large scale projects in relation to fixed expenses 
operating income as a percentage of net sales remained essentially flat at and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the leverage gained from the additional week included in fiscal year and the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with fas was offset by lower sales volume and reduced gross margins in relation to fixed expenses for our water sewer segment 
the decrease in gross margin was due in part to competitive pressures and deflationary pricing on pvc and ductile iron pipe products 
several low margin infrastructure projects combined with a higher proportion of direct shipments  which typically generate lower gross margins  also negatively impacted gross margins in fiscal year plumbing hvac operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to of net sales in the fiscal year from of net sales in fiscal year the basis points decrease during fiscal year was primarily due to lower gross margin direct shipments comprising a higher percentage of the sales mix as well as increased selling  general and administrative expenses driven by costs associated with closing of seven underperforming branches and our texas distribution center during january these decreases were partially offset by lower personnel expenses resulting from headcount reductions 
additionally fiscal year s performance was favorably impacted by the leverage gained from the additional week in its first quarter 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased to in fiscal year from an operating loss of in fiscal year the basis points improvement in operating income was largely attributable to lower provisions for doubtful accounts  the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with fas and the leverage gained from the additional week included in fiscal year the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year largely due to the economic slowdown that affected our markets  particularly our international business  during late fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million for our international business 
gross margin also improved due  in part  to the closure of certain branches in fiscal year during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we closed branches in the plumbing hvac segment because these branches did not strategically fit into our core businesses and or they did not perform to expectations 
these branches generally yielded lower gross margins in relation to the other branches 
gross margin was also favorably impacted by margin improvement programs initiated during fiscal year  including increases in vendor rebate programs and focused purchasing 
mro operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease of basis points in fiscal year was primarily driven by lower gross margins due to changes in sales mix and higher selling  general and administrative expenses partially attributable to start up costs associated with newly opened page of branches 
additionally fiscal year s performance was favorably impacted by the leverage gained from the additional week in its first quarter 
operating income as a percentage of net sales was and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the basis points improvement was due to the leverage gained from the additional week included in the first quarter of fiscal year combined with substantially higher sales volumes and gross margin improvements 
the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to more focused purchasing and a change in sales mix from lower margin products such as appliances to higher margin products  including imported items such as plumbing fixtures 
utilities operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the basis points decrease was primarily due to lower gross margins due to competitive pressures 
increased selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower provisions for doubtful accounts due to the recovery of a significant customer account in fiscal year additionally fiscal year s performance was favorably impacted by the leverage gained from the additional week in its first quarter 
operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year operating income was negatively impacted by lower gross margins  which resulted from a change in sales mix 
partially offsetting this decrease was the leverage gained from the additional week included in fiscal year and the acquisition of utiliserve  which generates higher operating income returns compared to the utilities segment and hughes as a whole 
electrical operating income as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat at and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
reduced selling  general and administrative expenses were proportionate with lower sales volumes resulting from competitive pressures and weak commercial and industrial markets 
gross margins benefited from improved vendor rebates  which resulted from our continued focus on vendor consolidation efforts and improved programs with suppliers 
operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the fiscal year lower sales volumes in relation to the fixed expenses for the electrical segment offset the leverage gained from the additional week included in fiscal year and the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with fas partially offsetting this decline was improved gross margin  largely due to the implementation of centralized pricing on the hughes unified operating system 
gross margin also benefited from margin improvement programs initiated during fiscal year  including increases in vendor rebate programs  more focused purchasing and reduced dead stock inventories  which resulted from the sale  disposal or return of inventories to our vendors 
industrial pvf operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to substantially lower sales volumes and gross margins in fiscal year due to the sharp decline in power and petrochemical industry capital spending and new plant construction 
operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the industrial pvf segment benefited from the leverage gained from the additional week in fiscal year and the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with fas despite reduced sales volumes in fiscal year  the industrial pvf segment was able to increase gross margin by basis points 
this gross margin improvement in fiscal year was due to increased sales prices for certain commodity based products  including stainless steel and nickel alloys 
gross margin also benefited from increases in the vendor rebate programs and reduced dead stock inventories  which resulted from the sale  disposal or return of inventories to the vendors 
all other operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year significant increases in sales volumes  particularly strong sales growth in the building materials and fire protection product lines  resulted in a basis points improvement in fiscal year these increases were partially offset by decreases in gross margins on stock shipments associated with competitive pressures 
page of operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year higher provisions for doubtful accounts and lower gross margins offset the leverage gained from the additional week in fiscal year and the elimination of goodwill amortization under fas gross margin decreased primarily as a result of competitive pressures and deflationary pricing on lumber and plywood products in the building materials product line 
interest and other income interest and other income totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to reduced collections of service charge income on past due or delinquent accounts 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal year was attributable to reduced interest income of million  of which million related to the million short term receivable recorded in connection with the sale of our pool spa business in january average cash balances and interest rates declined during fiscal year  which contributed to the remaining decrease in interest income 
further contributing to the overall decrease in interest and other income was reduced foreign exchange gains related to our discontinued international operations in mexico 
interest expense in fiscal year and fiscal year  interest expense totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to approximately million of debt issuance costs associated with the interim million senior unsecured term loan the term loan and additional borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility used to initially fund the acquisition of century 
we used the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in january to repay the term loan in full 
we also incurred million of loan origination fees in connection with the amendment of our revolving credit agreement to permit the new term loan borrowings and to make its financial and other covenants essentially the same as the term loan agreement 
these increases were offset by lower average interest rates and lower outstanding debt balances in fiscal year total debt decreased million or from million as of january  to million of january  and our weighted average interest rate for fiscal year decreased basis points compared to the prior year 
interest expense totaled million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense of million or in fiscal year was due to a reduction of average outstanding debt balances combined with lower interest rates in fiscal year borrowing levels were reduced in the first and second quarters of fiscal year largely as a result of working capital improvements 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we made additional borrowings under our senior revolving credit agreement in order to fund the acquisition of utiliserve 
as a result  total debt increased from million at january  to million at january  income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a lower effective state income tax rate and a tax benefit related to a discontinued operation in mexico 
net income net income totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we adopted fas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
had we accounted for goodwill consistent with the provisions of fas in prior periods  our net income and diluted earnings per share would have been million  million  and million and  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
other factors impacting net income and diluted earnings per share have been discussed above 
page of financial condition liquidity and capital resources the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity dollars in millions fiscal years ended net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities january  january  january  working capital current ratio to to to debt to capital working capital compared to fiscal year  working capital increased million or in fiscal year the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to higher accounts receivable balances driven by same store sales growth and the acquisitions of century and marden susco  lower current portion of long term debt due to the pay off of a senior note that matured during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and increased cash and cash equivalents 
these working capital increases were offset by lower levels of owned inventories inventories less accounts payable resulting from improved inventory and payables management 
we continue to maintain a focus on working capital improvement and have implemented initiatives to improve each element of our working capital 
lower levels of cash and other current assets combined with increases in current maturities of long term debt  accounts payable  and accrued compensation and benefits balances drove the working capital decrease of million in fiscal year these changes were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
other current assets decreased primarily due to the collection of income tax receivables in the first quarter of fiscal year the higher accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable reflect the acquisition of utiliserve  which added million of working capital at january  inventories and accounts payable balances increased due to strategic purchases  primarily in the industrial pvf segment 
the increase in accrued compensation and benefits is due to higher accrued bonuses from increased profitability in fiscal year combined with the timing of bi weekly payroll payments 
operating activities in fiscal years and  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in operating cash flows was primarily driven by fluctuations in inventories and accounts payable 
partially offsetting these operating cash flow increases were fluctuations in other current assets and accrued compensation and benefits 
the million increase in inventories during fiscal year includes million related to the acquisitions of century and marden susco  which are classified as investing activities for cash flow reporting purposes 
the remaining net inventory decrease of million is the result of improved inventory management  and lower pricing of pvc and ductile pipe products in the water sewer segment offset by strategic industrial pvf segment purchases that took place in fiscal year improved cash disbursement management was the primary driver of the million increase to accounts payable in fiscal year of which million was associated with the acquisitions of century and marden susco and classified as an investing activity for cash flow reporting purposes 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we collected approximately million of non recurring income tax receivables  which decreased the other current asset balance and favorably impacted operating cash flows for fiscal year fluctuations page of in accrued compensation and benefits balances primarily reflect the decrease in our vacation accrual associated with a policy change in and the timing of bi weekly payroll payments 
accounts receivable balances increased million in fiscal year of which million related to investing activity associated with the acquisitions of century and marden susco 
the remaining increase of million due to increasing sales volumes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year was offset by the fiscal year provision for doubtful accounts of million  which was lower than fiscal year s provision primarily due to lower write offs of uncollectible customer accounts and higher recoveries of previously written off receivables 
days sales outstanding also remained consistent in both periods 
the decrease of million in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from increases in inventories and accounts receivable and a decrease in depreciation and amortization 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in net income  accounts payable  accrued compensation and benefits  and a decrease in other current assets 
accounts receivable increased as a result of higher sales volumes in january compared to january overall  days sales outstanding for accounts receivable remained essentially flat in both periods 
inventories and accounts payable increased as a result of strategic purchases  primarily in the industrial pvf segment 
other current assets primarily decreased due to the collection of income tax receivables in fiscal year the increase in net income of million was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily resulting from the elimination of goodwill amortization under fas going forward  we expect to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for operational purposes 
investing activities our expenditures for property and equipment were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
of these expenditures  million  million and million  respectively  related to it outlays 
included in the it outlays were million  million and million related to the hughes unified operating system in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the hughes unified capital expenditures were primarily for personal computers and related hardware along with capitalized software upgrades

fas provides greater clarification of the characteristics of a derivative instrument so that contracts with similar characteristics will be accounted for consistently 
in general  fas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  as we do not currently have any derivative financial instruments  the adoption of fas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may and clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
previously  many of those financial instruments were classified as equity 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  as we did not have any of these financial instruments  the adoption of fas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued in january fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation and disclosure requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities as of january  in december  a revision to fin fin r was issued to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
adoption of the provisions of fin r is required for interim periods ending after march  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this revision will have on our consolidated financial statements  and do not expect it to have a material impact 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the prescription drug benefit under medicare 
questions have arisen regarding whether an employer that provides postretirement prescription drug coverage page of should recognize the effects of the act on its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and net postretirement benefit costs under fas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
while we do offer benefits  including prescription drug coverage  to employees who have attained certain levels of service after they have retired  those benefits are only available to retirees until age  at which time medicare coverage becomes effective 
as such  we do not believe that this specific provision of the act will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fas revised fas r  employer s disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
fas r retains disclosure requirements of the original fas and requires additional disclosures relating to assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefits cost 
fas r is effective for fiscal years ending after december  interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the provisions of fas r did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers  vendors and other outside sources and management s estimates  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers  their credit worthiness and an assessment of our lien and bond rights 
initially  we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and on a quarterly basis  we write off uncollectible receivables 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while we have a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a slowdown in the markets in which we operate may result in higher than expected uncollectible accounts  and therefore  the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
to the extent historical credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail  the allowance for doubtful accounts could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for doubtful accounts 
at january  and january   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of substantially all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market 
this evaluation includes an analysis of each branch s physical inventory results over the last two years  a review of potential dead stock based on historical product sales and forecasted sales and an overall consolidated analysis of potential excess inventory 
periodically  the branch s perpetual inventory records are adjusted to reflect permanent declines in market value 
to the extent historical physical inventory results are not indicative of future results and if future events impact  either favorably or unfavorably  the saleability of our products or our relationship with certain key vendors  our inventory reserves could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future inventory provisions 
at january  and january   our inventory reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors at the beginning of each calendar year  we enter into agreements with many of our vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels 
we accrue the receipt of vendor rebates as part of our cost of sales for products sold based on progress towards earning the vendor rebates  taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through the end of the year 
an estimate of unearned vendor rebates is page of included in the carrying value of inventory at each period end for vendor rebates to be received on products not yet sold 
while we believe we will continue to receive consideration from vendors in fiscal year and thereafter  there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of vendor rebates in the future 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to analyze recoverability  we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows that require judgment by management 
if different estimates were used  the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to goodwill of one entity in our plumbing hvac segment 
self insurance we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  automobile  general and product liability claims 
we also maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure arising from such claims 
self insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and our historical loss development experience 
to the extent the projected future development of the losses resulting from workers compensation  automobile  general and product liability claims incurred as of january  differs from the actual development of such losses in future periods  our insurance reserves could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future insurance expense 
at january  and january   self insurance reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity rate risk we are aware of the potentially unfavorable effects inflationary pressures may create through higher asset replacement costs and related depreciation  higher interest rates and higher material costs 
in addition  our operating performance is affected by price fluctuations in steel  nickel alloy  copper  aluminum  plastic  lumber and other commodities 
we seek to minimize the effects of inflation and changing prices through economies of purchasing and inventory management resulting in cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins 
we believe that inflation which has been moderate over the past few years did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal years  or as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
such commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and could continue to do so in the future 
interest rate risk at january   we had approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt 
based upon a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates from their january  levels  the market risk with respect to our variable rate debt would not be material 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt
