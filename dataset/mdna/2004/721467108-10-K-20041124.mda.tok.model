item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general profitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
cyclical earnings fluctuations can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared foods products 
prepared foods products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduces the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our consolidated cost of goods sold in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the us and fo reign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
as a significant portion of the us poultry production is exported  the commodity prices of chicken and turkey can be  and in recent periods have been  adversely affected by disruptions in poultry export markets 
these disruptions are often caused by restriction on imports of us produced poultry products imposed by foreign governments for a variety of reasons  including the protection of their domestic poultry producers and allegations of consumer health issues 
for example  russia and japan have restricted the importation of us produced poultry for both of these reasons in recent periods 
in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff rate was reduced on january  to and will be reduced in each of the following four years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
the tariff was imposed due to concerns that the duty free importation of such products as provided by the north american free trade agreement would injure mexico s poultry industry 
as such tariffs are reduced  we expect greater amount s of chicken to be imported into mexico from the us  which could negatively affect the profitability of mexican chicken producers and positively affect the profitability of us exporters of chicken to mexico 
although this could have a negative impact on our mexican chicken operations  we believe that this will be mitigated by the close proximity of our us operations to the mexico border 
we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which gives us a strategic advantage to capitalize on exports of us chicken to mexico 
because these disruptions in poultry export markets are often political  no assurances can be given as to when the existing disruptions will be alleviated or that new ones will not arise 
business segments we operate in two reportable business segments as a producer of chicken and other products and a producer of turkey products 
our chicken and other products segment primarily includes sales of chicken products and by products we produce and purchase for resale in the us  including puerto rico  and mexico 
this segment also includes the sale of table eggs  feed and certain other items 
our chicken and other products segment conducts separate operations in the us and puerto rico and in mexico and is reported as two separate geographical areas 
substantially all of the assets and operations of the recently acquired conagra chicken division are included in our us chicken and other products segment since the date of acquisition 
our turkey segment includes sales of turkey products produced in our turkey operations  which operate exclusively in the us inter area sales and inter segment sales  which are not material  are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer sales 
corporate expenses are allocated to mexico based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the us portions of the segments based on number of employees 
non recurring recoveries  which represent settlements for vitamin and methionine litigation covering several periods as well as federal compensation for avian influenza  have not been allocated to any segment because the proper allocation cannot be readily determined 
the following table presents certain information regarding our segments fiscal year ended october  a september  september  in thousands net sales to customers chicken and other products united states mexico sub total turkey total operating income loss chicken and other products united states mexico sub total turkey b sub total non recurring recoveries c total depreciation and amortization d chicken and other products united states mexico sub total turkey total total assets chicken and other products united states mexico sub total turkey total capital expenditures chicken and other products united states mexico sub total turkey total a the company acquired the conagra chicken division on november  for million 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations for this acquisition have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date 
b included in fiscal are restructuring charges totaling million offset somewhat by the non recurring recovery of million representing the gain recognized on the insurance proceeds received in connection with the october recall 
c non recurring recoveries which have not been allocated to the individual segments are as follows in millions october  september  september  avian influenza vitamin methionine total d includes amortization of capitalized financing costs of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the following table presents certain items as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended october  september  september  net sales cost and expenses cost of sales cost of sales restructuring non recurring recoveries gross profit selling  general and administrative expense other restructuring charges operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes net income results of operations the change in our results of operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal is impacted by a number of significant items 
the following is a brief description of these items and the nature of their effect on each of the periods being presented 
first  as discussed below and in note b business acquisition of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  on november  we completed the purchase of the conagra chicken division 
this acquisition has resulted in significant increases in net sales and related costs  as well as assets  liabilities  interest and outstanding debt 
the acquired business has been included in our results of operations for of the weeks in fiscal second  the increase in us chicken sales reflects an increase in total revenue per dressed pound produced  primarily due to significantly higher chicken selling prices during the year 
chicken component market prices reached their highest level in the us since during our fiscal third quarter 
since that time  the reference chicken component market prices have declined significantly 
however  partially offsetting this decline in component market chicken prices are recent declines in market prices for corn and soybean meal  which are a significant component of our consolidated cost of sales 
additionally  barring widespread weather or other problems in grain producing areas  worldwide corn and soybean meal productivity is expected to increase  which should further favorably impact feed ingredie nt costs in fiscal and should partially offset the decline in us component market chicken prices 
third  fiscal included weeks versus fiscal  which included weeks  resulting in an increase in each of the categories discussed in our results of operations by approximately as compared to the corresponding period in the preceding year 
as this change impacted all the income statement categories in a reasonably consistent manner  no separate discussion of this factor is included in our results of operations discussion  unless the impact of the applicable category varied from the increase described above 
fourth  as discussed above under restructuring of turkey operations and in note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  on april  we announced a plan to restructure our turkey business and recorded  as cost of sales restructuring  million  primarily due to asset impairments and inventory losses on discontinued products  and  as other restructuring charges  million  primarily related to exit and severance costs 
we expect that commodity sales in our turkey division will decrease by approximately million in fiscal as a result of this restructuring 
finally  in october  one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria 
we later received information from the usda suggesting environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  we estimate that gross profit and operating income were negatively affected by this product recall by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal prior to the insurance recovery discussed below 
we carry insuran ce designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by a recall 
as a result of this recall  the company s insurance claim for business interruption and certain product re establishment costs amounted to approximately million for the period from the date of the recall through october   the one year anniversary of the recall and the insurance policy time limitation period for business interruption loss recovery 
aggregating the direct recall expense claim with the anticipated business interruption and product re establishment costs  our total loss was approximately million  although our policy limit was million 
we received million of this amount in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal from our insurer 
in connection with the receipt of the insurance proceeds  we recognized million as a component of non recurring recoveries in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal after considering the fiscal losses related to the recall and the restructuring of the turkey division in fiscal  we believe we will significantly reduce our losses in the turkey division in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased billion  or  over fiscal the following table provides additional information regarding net sales in millions fiscal year ended october  change from percentage source fiscal change chicken and other products united states chicken a other products b mexico chicken other products turkey c a us chicken sales increased primarily due to the acquisition of the conagra chicken division  which contributed  million since the acquisition 
also affecting the us chicken sales was an increase of in total revenue per dressed pound produced  primarily due to significantly higher component market chicken prices during the year 
as described below under gross profit component market chicken prices have declined in recent months 
b the conagra chicken division acquisition contributed million to sales of other products primarily due to non chicken products sold by the acquired distribution business 
c the decrease in turkey sales was due to a decrease in turkey production created by a reduction in turkey flocks beginning in july  offset by an increase in revenue per pound produced 
as described above in restructuring of turkey operations and in note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  as a result of our fiscal restructuring of our turkey operations  we expect that commodity sales in our turkey division will decrease by approximately million in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the following table provides gross profit information in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal net sales cost of sales a cost of sales restructuring b non recurring recoveries c gross profit a cost of sales in the us operations increased  million due primarily to the conagra chicken division acquisition  as well as significantly higher grain costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
our mexico operations had a million increase primarily due to higher grain costs 
chicken component market prices reached their highest level in the us since during our fiscal third quarter 
since that time  the reference chicken component market prices have declined significantly 
however  partially offsetting this decline in component market chicken prices are recent declines in both the cash and futures market prices for corn and soybean meal  which comprise of our consolidated cost of sales 
additionally  barring widespread weather or other problems in grain producing areas  wor ldwide corn and soybean meal productivity is expected to increase  which should further favorably impact feed ingredient costs in fiscal and should partially offset the decline in us component market chicken prices 
b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey business to significantly reduce our production of commodity turkey meat and strengthen our focus on value added turkey products 
as part of our restructuring effort  we sold our hinton  virginia turkey commodity meat operations 
in fiscal we recorded  as cost of sales restructuring  approximately million of asset impairment charges and inventory losses on discontinued products and  as other restructuring charges  million  primarily related to exit and severance costs 
c non recurring recoveries in fiscal year consisted mainly of a million gain from insurance proceeds related to our product recall 
in fiscal  we had non recurring recoveries of million consisting of million in payments from the federal government to compensate turkey producers for avian influenza losses and million related to the anti trust lawsuits involving vitamins and methionine 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal increased million  or  as described in the following table in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal gross profit selling  general and administrative expense a other restructuring charges b operating income c a selling  general and administrative expense increased million due primarily to the fiscal acquisition  but decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to the fixed nature of certain expenses in relation to increased sales 
b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey division  including the sale or closure of some facilities in virginia 
approximately million related to exit and severance costs in connection with the restructuring were charged to other restructuring charges 
c operating income for us chicken of million is offset by operating losses of million in mexico and million for turkey 
the loss in mexico compared to operating income of million in fiscal is primarily due to increased feed cost 
the loss for turkey compared to a loss of million in fiscal is primarily due to our restructuring noted above  the continuing effect of the recall and significant losses on commodity turkey sales 
interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances experienced in the fiscal year due to the financing of the fiscal acquisition partially offset by significant debt repayment with excess cash flow in fiscal income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this increase in consolidated income tax expense is the result of higher pretax earnings in fiscal fiscal income tax expense was significantly reduced by a tax benefit recorded in fiscal of approximately million to reflect the benefit resulting from a reduction in valuation allowance of the net operating loss carryforwards for mexican tax purposes 
the recently passed american jobs creation act of represents far reaching legislation that will have a significant impact on many us taxpayers 
among other things  the act will provide a deduction with respect to income of certain us manufacturing activities and allow for favorable taxing on repatriation of offshore earnings 
although the provisions of the act do not impact the fiscal year financial statements under current accounting rules  the act will likely impact the company s financial statements in future periods 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this act 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  over fiscal the following table provides additional information regarding net sales in millions fiscal year ended september  change from percentage source fiscal change chicken and other products united states chicken a other products b mexico chicken c other products subtotal turkey d a the million increase in us chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced and a increase in total revenue per dressed pound produced  reflecting increased market prices for chicken 
b the million increase in sales of other products was primarily due to increased sales of eggs and poultry by products 
c the increase in mexico chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in pounds produced offset by a decrease in average revenue per dressed pound produced 
d the decrease in turkey sales was primarily due to the impact of the recall of turkey deli meat products  partially offset by improved sales resulting from live production improvements since the avian influenza outbreak in the previous year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  over fiscal included in gross profit for fiscal was million of non recurring recoveries 
fiscal gross profit only included million of non recurring recoveries 
see note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the following table provides gross profit information in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage september  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income a us operations cost of sales increased million primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds of chicken produced 
mexico operations cost of sales increased million primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced 
b non recurring recoveries of million consisted of million in avian influenza recovery and million in vitamin and methionine litigation settlements 
see note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
c in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we liquidated a significant portion of turkey breast meat that we had been accumulating to use in our further processed turkey products during the peak turkey season when prices have historically been highest 
this liquidation resulted in bulk turkey breast meat sales at prices that were lower than we have traditionally experienced on our individual product sales for similar product 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal increased million when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the million of non recurring recoveries somewhat offset by increased cost of sales as discussed above 
the following table provides operating income information in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage september  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances experienced in the fiscal year 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal was million  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal this increase in consolidated income tax expense is the result of changes in the mexico tax law and higher pretax earnings in fiscal  which were significantly offset by a tax benefit of approximately million to reflect the benefit resulting from a reduction in valuation allowance of the net operating loss carryforwards for mexican tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents on an overall basis the significant borrowings and the debt repayments which occurred in fiscal borrowings related primarily to the acquisition of the conagra chicken business while repayments were made primarily with excess cash flow resulting from operations 
notes payable and long term debt activity in thousands balance at activity during balance at september  fiscal october  borrowings re payments other senior unsecured debt a senior subordinated debt secured debt b other b total a amortization of debt premium 
b the company borrowed million in connection with the conagra chicken division acquisition and assumed million of long term debt 
as of october   we had million in revolving credit facilities  million of which relates to our mexico operations  and million in a secured revolving term borrowing facility 
borrowings under the revolving term borrowing facility are available on a revolving basis until april  at which time the outstanding borrowings will be converted to a term loan 
approximately one half of the converted term loan principal balance outstanding as of april  will be payable in quarterly installments through august  with all remaining principal and interest due on august  the million revolving term borrowing facility provides for interest rates ranging from libor plus one percent to libor plus two and five eighths percent depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
there were no borrowings under the revolving term borrowing facility at october  as a result of borrowing base restrictions  million was available under the revolving term borrowing facility for borrowings at october  the facility is secured by certain fixed assets 
as of november   our availability under the revolving term borrowing facility increased to million due to the inclusion of additional collateral 
additionally  as of october   we added an million revolving facility that was converted from a term facility 
the million domestic revolving credit facility provides for interest rates ranging from libor plus seven eighths percent to libor plus two and three eighths percent depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
the million domestic revolving credit facility  million of which was available for borrowings at october   is secured by domestic chicken inventories 
the million facility in mexico is ful ly available as of october   matures on december   and is secured by the accounts receivable  inventories and certain fixed assets of the company s mexico operations 
borrowings against these facilities are subject to the availability of eligible collateral and no material adverse change provisions 
in november  the company borrowed approximately million in additional long term debt to fund the closing of the conagra chicken division acquisition 
the specific borrowings are discussed in note b business acquisition of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and consisted of a combination of subordinated debt  senior notes and asset based borrowings 
on november   the company and ppc escrow corp  a wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary of the company  entered into an agreement to issue million in senior subordinated notes with an interest rate of maturing on november  the proceeds from the note offering were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the conagra chicken division 
ppc escrow corp 
was merged with and into pilgrim s pride concurrently with the closing of the acquisition of the conagra chicken division 
we also maintain operating leases for various types of equipment  some of which contain residual value guarantees for the market value of assets at the end of the term of the lease 
the terms of the lease maturities range from one to seven years 
we estimate the maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is approximately million  however  the actual amount would be offset by any recoverable amount based on the fair market value of the underlying leased assets 
no liability has been recorded related to this contingency as the likelihood of payments under these guarantees is not considered to be probable and the fair value of the guarantees is immaterial 
we historically have not experienced significant payments under similar residual guarantees 
at october   our working capital increased to million and our current ratio decreased to to  compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september   primarily due to the working capital changes discussed below 
trade accounts and other receivables were million at october   compared to million at september  the million  or  increase in trade accounts and other receivables was primarily due to the inclusion of the conagra chicken division  increased sales activity and a decrease in receivables sold 
trade accounts and other receivables at the end of fiscal did not include million of receivables which were sold pursuant to the receivables purchase agreement described below 
inventories were million at october   compared to million at september  the million  or  increase in inventories was primarily due to the acquisition of the conagra chicken division and increased production to support sales growth 
accounts payable  income taxes payable and accrued expenses increased million to million at october   compared to accounts payable  income taxes payable and accrued expenses of million at september  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the conagra chicken division  increased production and income tax liabilities resulting from our results 
capital expenditures excluding business acquisitions of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  were primarily incurred to acquire and expand certain facilities  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we anticipate spending approximately million to million in fiscal to improve efficiencies and for the routine replacement of equipment at our current operations 
we expect to finance such expenditures with available operating cash flows and existing revolving term and revolving credit facilities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to significant increase in our net income in fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities were almost unchanged for fiscal when compared to fiscal however  the composition of working capital items shifted significantly from  primarily due to recall related items offset by increases in other working capital components 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal is primarily due to borrowings to finance the acquisition of the conagra chicken division offset somewhat by cash repayments of borrowings 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  primarily reflects the higher net payments on long term financing 
we are a party to many routine contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks 
among other considerations  we have not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities as based upon the likelihood of payment  the fair value of such indemnities is immaterial 
our loan agreements generally obligate us to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes i any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of  deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan  ii any tax  duty or other charge with respect to the loan except standard income tax or iii capital adequacy requirements 
in addition  some of our loan agreements contain a withholding tax provision that requires us to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party  generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law 
these increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction  and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts we could be obligat ed to pay under such provisions 
any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default  and  in a secured financing transaction  would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due 
off balance sheet arrangements on june   the camp county industrial development corporation issued million of variable rate environmental facilities revenue bonds supported by letters of credit obtained by us 
we may draw from these proceeds over the construction period for new sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at a poultry by products plant to be built in camp county  texas 
we are not required to borrow the full amount of the proceeds from these revenue bonds 
all amounts borrowed from these funds will be due in the revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit obtained by us under our available revolving credit facilities which are secured by our domestic chicken inventories 
the bonds will be recorded as debt of the company if and when they are spent to fund construction 
we maintain a receivables purchase agreement under which we can sell on a revolving basis up to million of certain trade receivables the pooled receivables to a special purpose corporation wholly owned by us  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest to third parties 
this facility matures on june  at october  there were no pooled receivables sold and at september   an interest in these pooled receivables of million had been sold to third parties and was reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable 
the gross proceeds resulting from the sale are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
losses on these sales were immaterial 
as of october  the full amount of the facility was available 
contractual obligations and guarantees 
obligations under long term debt and non cancelable operating leases at october  were as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt a guarantee fees operating leases purchase obligations total a excludes million in letters of credit outstanding related to normal business transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer programs and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes and product recall accounting 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be r easonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment and transfer of ownership of the product to the customer and is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
inventory 
live poultry inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeder hens at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or market 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over the productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventory and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence  including significantly aged produ cts  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  primarily including leg quarters  wings  tenders and offal  which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost 
generally  the company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or market adjustments are required based on a number of factors  including i pools of related inventory  ii product continuation or discontinuation  iii estimated market selling prices and iv expected distribution channels 
if actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those as sets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  remaining length of service and estimated salvage values ii estimated fair market value of the assets and iii determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment test  generally groupings of related operational facilities 
contingent liabilities 
the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made when losses are determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
certain categories of claim liabilities are actuarially determined 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
purchase price accounting 
the company allocates the total purchase price in connection with acquisitions to assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values 
for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for significant acquisitions  the company has historically relied upon the use of third party valuation experts to assist in the estimation of fair values 
historically  the carrying value of acquired accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable have approximated their fair value as of the date of acquisition  though adjustments are made within purchase price accounting to the extent needed to record such assets and liabilities at fair value 
with respect to accr ued liabilities  the company uses all available information to make its best estimate of the fair value of the acquired liabilities and  when necessary  may rely upon the use of third party actuarial experts to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities  primarily self insurance accruals 
product recall accounting 
the company has a separate insurance contract for product recall coverage with an insurance company that specifically provides for reimbursement of direct recall related expenses  product restoration expenses and loss of business income 
the company recorded receivables related to direct recall related expense  specifically related to the write off of inventory  third party shipping and freight costs  payments made for outside labor  internal hourly labor  third party warehouse storage costs and payments to customers 
the company recorded amounts as receivable for only the readily  objectively determinable amounts of direct product recall costs reimbursable under its insurance policy 
th e recoveries related to the business interruption and product re establishment portions of the insurance recoveries are recorded when realized  generally upon collection 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
taxes are provided for international subsidiaries based on the assumption that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and as such deferred taxes are not provided for in us income taxes that would be required in the event of distribution of these earnings 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of the individual operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients we purchase certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  we will from time to time lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
we do not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of october  based on our feed consumption during fiscal  such an increase would have resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million 
foreign currency our earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of our mexico subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure primarily by attempting to minimize our mexican peso net monetary position  but from time to time  we have also considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
such instruments  however  have historically not been economically feasible 
we are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the us however  we currently anticipate that the cash flows of our mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in our mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our results of operations and financial position i n several ways  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations resulting from a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos  was a loss of million in fiscal  a gain of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal on october   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  compared to at september  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
interest rates our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt instruments 
we have variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of our long term debt at october  holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a basis points increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by million for fiscal these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate long term debt at october market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of october   using discounted cash flow analysis 
impact of inflation due to low to moderate inflation in the us and mexico and our rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period 
forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee and similar expressions  are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include those described under risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  among others  many of which are beyond our control 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking  and specifically decline to undertake  any obligation to address or update each or any factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results  and we are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes in information contained in previous filings or communications 
though we have attempted to list comprehensively these important cautionary risk factors  we wish to caution investors and others that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our business or results of operations 
risk factors cyclicality and commodity prices 
industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey 
profitability in the chicken and turkey industries is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens and turkeys or deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  in some instances  to enter into advance purchase commitments or financial hedging contracts for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
however  we may not hedge feed ingredient cost risk unless requested by a specific customer or it is otherwise deemed prudent and any use of such instruments may not be successful 
contamination of products 
if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
poultry products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms  or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and generic e 
coli 
these pathogens are generally found in the environment  and  as a result  there is a risk that they  as a result of food processing  could be present in our processed poultry products 
these pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
these risks may be controlled  although not eliminated  by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing 
we have little  if any  control over proper handling once the product has been shipped 
illness and death may result if the pathogens are not eliminated at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and prospects 
in october  one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria 
we later received information from the usda suggesting environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  we carried insurance designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by the recall 
we estimate that the sales in our turkey division were negatively affected by approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for those same periods  we estimate that operating margins were negatively affected by approximately to million and to million  respectively 
aggregating the direct recall expense claim with the anticipated business interruption and product re establishment costs  our total loss was approximately million  although our policy limit was million 
we received million of this amount in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal from our insurer 
livestock and poultry disease 
outbreaks of livestock diseases in general and poultry disease in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  turkey or other products to or from our suppliers  facilities or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation and prospects 
an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza  a disease contagious to turkey  chicken and other birds  had a negative effect on our fiscal and the first six months of fiscal operating results 
there can be no assurance that any future poultry disease outbreaks will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability 
product liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators 
the packaging  marketing and distribution of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity 
we may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury  illness or death 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or damage to the products 
in addition to the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by our production or processing operations  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to perform product recalls  or that product liability claims will not be asserted against us  in the future 
any claims that may be made may create adverse publicity tha t would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as described above under contamination of products  if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
in october  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october  in connection with this recall  we were named as a defendant in twelve lawsuits brought by individuals alleging injuries resulting from contracting listeria monocytogenes 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any litigation or reputational injury associated with this or any future product recal ls will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
our business operations entail a number of risks  including risks relating to product liability claims  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons 
we currently maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks  including product liability insurance  property insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance  but in many cases such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events  or at all 
moreover  even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events  it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection wit h such events 
for example  the losses attributable to our october recall of cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities significantly exceeded available insurance coverage 
additionally  in the past two of our insurers encountered financial difficulties and were unable to fulfill their obligations under the insurance policies as anticipated and separately two of our other insurers contested coverage with respect to claims covered under policies purchased  forcing us to litigate the issue of coverage before we were able to collect under these policies 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including in the health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
significant competition 
competition in the chicken and turkey industries with other vertically integrated poultry companies  especially companies with greater resources  may make us unable to compete successfully in these industries  which could adversely affect our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
in both the us and mexico  we primarily compete with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us poultry industry include price  product quality  brand identification  breadth of product line  and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that competition is based on product quality  brand awareness  customer service and price 
further  there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the prepared food business 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
additionally  the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   required annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november   the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action was warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry were eliminated in january in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tar iff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff was reduced on january  and is to be reduced each of the following four years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
as those tariffs are reduced  increased competition from chicken imported into mexico from the us may have a material adverse effect on the mexican chicken industry in general  and on our mexican operations in particular 
potential acquisitions 
we may pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  which could increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions 
additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions may harm our financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions may be structured in such a manner that would result in the assumption of unknown liabilities not disclosed by the seller or uncovered during pre acquisition due diligence 
for example  our acquisition of the conagra chicken division was structured as a stock purchase 

in that acquisition we assumed all of the liabilities of the conagra chicken division  including liabilities that may be unknown 
we negotiated and obtained from conagra foods certain representations and warranties concerning contingent liabilities and other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets to reduce the risk that we will bear such subsidiaries liability for unknown liabilities 
conagra foods also agreed to indemnify us for breaches of representations and warranties concerning the pre clo sing operations of the conagra chicken division and for certain liabilities of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets 
conagra foods indemnification obligations are generally subject to a million deductible  and there may be circumstances in which conagra foods indemnification obligations do not provide us protection from contingent or other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets  or other pre closing liabilities of the conagra chicken division 
these obligations and liabilities could harm our financial condition and operating results 
leverage 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt securities 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition which could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain necessary financing and to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and sell assets  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
despite our significant indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
if additional debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
foreign operations risks 
our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
we have significant operations and assets located in mexico 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past 
exchange rate fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our operations in mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws of mexico 
we may rely in part on intercompany loans and distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our claims 
additionally  the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make payments and distributions to us will be subject to  among other things  mexican law 
in the past  these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions 
however  laws such as these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future 
control of voting stock 
control over pilgrim s pride is maintained by members of the family of lonnie bo pilgrim 
as described in more detail in item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters  through two limited partnerships and related trusts and voting agreements  lonnie bo pilgrim  patty r 
pilgrim  his wife  and lonnie ken pilgrim  his son  control over of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  they control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of pilgrim s pride or its assets 
this ensures their ability to control the foreseeable future direction and management of pilgrim s pride 
in addition  an event of default under certain agreements related to our indebtedness will occur if lonnie bo pilgrim and c ertain members of his family cease to own at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock 
deferred taxes 
potential accrual of deferred taxes may affect our net income and cash flow 
we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our mexico subsidiaries based upon the determination that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested 
as of october   the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately million 
if these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us and foreign income taxes would have been provided  after consideration of estimated foreign tax credits 
however  determination of the amount of deferred federal and foreign income taxes is not practical
