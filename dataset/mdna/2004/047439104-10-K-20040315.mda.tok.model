item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
in this report  atherogenics  we  us and our refer to atherogenics  inc overview since our operations began in  we have focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  such as atherosclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis and asthma 
based on our proprietary vascular protectant  or v protectant  technology platform  we have advanced four drug development programs into clinical trials 
our lead compound  agi  is being evaluated in the phase iii clinical trial called arise aggressive reduction of inflammation stops events as an oral therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis 
agix  our second clinical compound  is a novel  oral agent being tested in a phase ii clinical trial called oscar oral suppression of cellular inflammation attenuates rheumatoid arthritis as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis 
agix iv is an intravenous rheumatoid arthritis treatment that has completed a phase i clinical trial 
agi is a novel  oral agent that is being developed for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in collaboration with fujisawa pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in addition to these compounds  we are progressing on a number of other preclinical programs 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and  excluding the effect of certain license fees of a non recurring nature  expect to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity and debt securities 
we have incurred significant losses since we began operations and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you whether or when we will become profitable 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and development costs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the successful development of our product candidates  to obtain required regulatory clearances  and to manufacture and market our future products 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
research and development accrual as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate expenses that we believe we have incurred  but have not yet been billed for 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of expenses for which we accrue based on estimates we make include fees for professional services  such as those provided by certain clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
we must sometimes estimate the date on which certain services commence and or the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents revenue recognition license fees  which are nonrefundable  are recognized when the related license agreements specify that no further efforts or obligations are required of us 
we had committed to perform certain research and development activities as part of a license agreement  which has been terminated  accordingly  the upfront license payment was amortized over the anticipated time period to conduct these activities 
revenues under research and development arrangements were recognized as the research and development activities were performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
these revenues were billed quarterly and the related payments were not refundable 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for our stock based employee compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as sfas requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  an amendment to sfas  requires disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
in connection with the grant of certain options to employees  we have recorded non cash deferred stock compensation of approximately million since  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates these stock options were granted 
deferred stock compensation is included as a reduction of shareholders equity and is being amortized to expense using the graded vesting method 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of each portion of the overall award over its respective vesting period  and results in higher vesting in earlier years than straight line vesting 
in connection with the grant of certain options and warrants to non employees during and  we recorded non cash deferred stock compensation of approximately million 
the fair value of the options and warrants for purposes of this calculation was determined by using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of the options and warrants is re measured at each measurement date  based on the then current fair value of our common stock 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during or we may receive revenues in the future related to potential licensing agreements with pharmaceutical companies for our compounds or programs 
expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increased expenditures for the agi arise phase iii clinical trial and the agix oscar phase ii clinical trial  such as manufacturing activities for clinical drug supply  study monitoring and payments to clinical investigators 
also contributing to the increase are the ongoing patient related costs for the agi cart phase iib clinical trial 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in this increase will be primarily related to activities surrounding the agi arise phase iii clinical trial 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums  consulting fees and business development expenses related to partnering activities 

table of contents amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in  compared to million in the decrease in compared to is primarily due to the deferred stock compensation being amortized using the graded vesting method  which results in higher amortization in the earlier years  partially offset by re measuring options and warrants granted to consultants based on our current  higher fair market value 
interest and other income interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest income earned on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income was million in  compared to  in the increase is due to the increased amount of invested funds received from our follow on offering in february and our convertible debt offering in august interest expense interest expense was million in compared to  in the increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense resulting from our million long term convertible debt  issued in august income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards and the research and development credit carryforwards will expire between and because of our lack of earnings history  the resulting deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the utilization of the loss and credit carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards 
we have completed an analysis of internal revenue code section limitations on the cumulative net operating loss carryforward 
the annual limitations are not expected to prevent utilization of the net operating loss carryforward due to significant increases in value indicated by the successive issuances of our stock 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during  compared to million in revenue in reflected the amortization of a million license fee payment and research and development revenue attributable to a license agreement that was terminated in october expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to increased expenditures for the phase ii clinical trials for agi and agix for items such as patient costs and clinical drug supply 
also contributing to the increase were start up expenditures related to organizing the arise phase iii clinical trial  which were primarily related to commercial formulation  manufacturing bulk drug supply and the hiring of additional employees in preparation for the planned clinical trials 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  were million in  compared to million in the increase of  or  reflects an increase in business development activities offset in part by lower expenditures for professional fees 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in  of which  was attributable to research and development expenses and million was attributable to general and administrative expenses 
in  amortization of deferred stock compensation was million  of which  was attributable to research and development expenses and million was attributable to general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in compared to was due to the deferred stock compensation being amortized using the graded vesting method  which results in higher amortization in the earlier years 
the decrease was partially offset by re measuring options and warrants granted to consultants to current fair market value  in accordance with eitf issue no 

table of contents interest and other income interest income was  in  compared to million in the decrease in interest income was a reflection of lower investment balances and lower average interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was  in was due to the interest on the equipment loan facility 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  convertible notes and payments received from a licensing agreement 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital at december  was million  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital for the year ended december  is primarily due to funds received from our follow on stock offering in february of approximately million and our convertible debt offering in august of approximately million 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital for the year ended from is due to the use of funds for operating purposes 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in the use of cash in operating activities is principally due to funding a net loss of million and an increase in prepaid expense of million  partially offset by an increase in the research and development accrual of million and accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in cash needed to fund the net loss is primarily attributable to expenditures for our arise phase iii clinical trial and our cart phase iib clinical trial for agi  and the implementation of our oscar phase ii clinical trial for agix  as well as other ongoing product development activities 
the increase in prepaid expense is due to pre payments made to contractors for the arise clinical trial which is being expensed when service is performed 
as a result of our ongoing phase iii arise clinical trial for agi and the expected increase in cash usage  we anticipate that prepaid expenses and the research and development accrual may fluctuate more significantly than in previous periods 
we anticipate net cash usage in for arise and our other on going preclinical and clinical programs  as well as our other operating activities  to be in a range of million to million  subject to the impact of a corporate partnering arrangement for agi net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and million used in investing activities in net cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of net purchases of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by investing activities during consisted primarily of the sales of available for sale securities  with the proceeds reinvested in interest bearing cash equivalents 
net cash used in investing activities during consisted primarily of net purchases of available for sale securities  and purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of primarily of million received from our follow on stock offering in february and million received from our convertible debt offering in august net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from an equipment loan facility and exercise of common stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million received from the private placement of our common stock in june in march  we entered into a revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank the bank for up to a maximum amount of million to be used for working capital requirements 
the revolving credit facility was not used  and as such  we terminated it in december we also entered into an equipment loan facility  as modified in june  with the bank for up to a maximum amount of million to be used to finance existing and new equipment purchases 
the borrowing period under the 
table of contents equipment loan facility  as modified  expired on september  at december   there was an outstanding balance of approximately  on the equipment loan facility and the weighted average interest rate was per year 
in february  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option that raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due through a rule a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
these notes initially are convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  or approximately per share 
net proceeds were approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for research and development activities  including clinical trials  process development and manufacturing support  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
pending these uses  the net proceeds have been invested in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
as of december   we have recorded million of interest expense related to the notes  which is due march  we have a contract with an organization that is currently conducting our phase ii and phase iii clinical trials for agi we will be required to pay a percentage of the remaining balance of the contract in the unlikely event that we terminate the contract 
as of december   the termination fee would have been approximately million had we elected to terminate at that time 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases  net of sublease income long term debt total contractual obligations based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish new licensing agreements 
we have historically accessed the capital markets from time to time to raise adequate funds for operating needs and cash reserves 
although we believe we have adequate cash for at least the next months  we may access capital markets when we believe market conditions or company needs merit doing so 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  all of which have a minimum investment rating of a p  money market funds  and government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
the following table summarizes the maturity of the debt and projected annual average interest rates on our equipment loan facility and convertible notes as of december  value as of december  total long term debt fixed rate maturity average interest rate
