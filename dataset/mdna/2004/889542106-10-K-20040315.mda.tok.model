item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview communication plays an integral part of our society  it is  in reality  a necessity of life 
telecommunication services provide people with a means to communicate  with people across the street and around the globe  through diverse channels ranging from traditional wired telephone service to wireless telephones to electronic means such as e mail and other internet based offerings 
as a leading producer of network assurance and monitoring systems for wired networks  our products permit service providers to supply their customers with consistent and high quality telecommunications offerings  allowing  for example  telephone companies to diagnose and assess problems within their networks and cable operators to monitor the power supplies necessary to operate their systems 
as a result of the rapid technological  regulatory and economic evolution of the telecommunications marketplace which we define to include cable television service over the past several years  we believe that it is our challenge  and our opportunity  to leverage our embedded base of customers and dominant market position to address the testing and monitoring needs of new system architectures by offering products addressing such needs that represent relatively small incremental investments in customers existing testing and monitoring systems 
we want to provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly transition from one network to another with comparatively minimal capital investments in existing testing solutions 
the recent downturn in the telecommunications industry revealed several trends that we expect to continue to impact our business incumbent telephone carriers continue to lose customers to smaller  independent carriers which are not as heavily regulated  cable providers have taken the initial lead in the broadband service market  primarily because cable modem technology was perfected before dsl technology and because telephone providers are regulated much more than cable companies  and both cable and telephone companies as well as the providers of satellite  wireless and other information mediums are eager to market the so called triple play of voice  data and video broadband services 
the result of these trends thus far has been that incumbent telephone carriers especially the rbocs have considerably slowed their investments in plain old telephone service pots line capacity relative to their capital investment patterns of the late s through  instead  some of these providers  from which we derive a large percentage of our revenue  are focusing their capital spending on next generation projects such as dsl service and fiber to the premises fttp 
capitalizing on their present technological advantages  cable companies have aggressively marketed their broadband services  in fact  due in part to the advent of wireless telephone service and internet based services  such as voice over internet protocol voip  cable providers are well positioned to promote the utility of cable broadband service over the need to maintain both wired telephone and cable services 
we continue to adapt to these and other changes in the marketplace  changing the perception that we are solely the provider of an old line legacy incumbent testing system 
as a result of our acquisition in of our cheetah cable product line  we believe that we have become the leading provider of status monitoring products for the cable industry  including services  approximately of our revenue was generated by cable product sales  a significant increase from the of our revenue generated by cable offerings 
our recently consummated alliance with alpha  the leading provider of cable power management products  should position us to sustain our leading position in the cable field in the wake of the recent adoption of the standardized hms and data over cable service interface specifications docsis protocols for cable modems that may in the future render our proprietary cable hardware products obsolete 
with respect to our telephony products  although we do not predict that our sales of our core mcu products will reach the levels seen in  we are encouraged by recent mcu sales in conjunction with large scale projects  most notably the building out of both pots networks by competitive service providers and dsl systems by the rbocs 
with regard to dsl  we plan to market our digitest system as a tool to measure a network s capacity to offer dsl service 
we have also in the past several years placed a greater emphasis on developing and marketing software applications that conform to industry needs  such as docsis and fiber optic only networks 
the result of our expanded cable and software offerings and changes in the industry generally is that our customer mix has changed and will continue to change  a factor which we expect will make us much less susceptible to the capital spending habits of a few select large customers 
however  notwithstanding our relative success in remaining profitable during the past several years  we believe that there is still too much flux in the marketplace to allow us to accurately predict the eventual direction that the telecommunications industry will take  or how our business might fit within that new model 
moreover  given the lower margins generated by our cable products relative to our proprietary mcu and software offerings  changes in our product mix may cause our overall profitability to decrease 
industry and market trends in the past  consumers had little choice in the range of available telecommunication services which was limited primarily to hardwire telephone lines or the number of providers of such services almost exclusively restricted to incumbent local exchange carriers 
this combination of limited services and providers  coupled with governmental regulation of the industry  meant that if consumers wanted telephone service  they bought it from the company designated by the government at a price approved by the government 
we believe that the continuing evolution of the telecommunications marketplace  driven by advances in technology as well as the deregulation of the industry  among other factors  have resulted  and will continue to result  in intense competition among telecommunications service providers 
many consumers now have the ability to choose among a variety of comparable telecommunication services offered by a number of different providers 
led by the adoption of the telecommunications act of  the deregulation of the industry has allowed certain consumers to obtain local telephone service from either their incumbent local exchange carrier  which in the old regulatory environment possessed the exclusive right to provide that service  or by one or more competitive service providers  which may actually provide telephone service over the network owned by that same local exchange carrier but at a lower cost 
moreover  consumers may choose from a growing list of communications options that provide the same level of service once reserved to the local telephone company 
the proliferation of wireless telephone service  for instance  now allows a consumer to place calls from nearly any location in the united states  and from most parts of the world 
using voip  a person may place a call from a computer either to another voip customer or to a hardwired or wireless telephone number 
as a result  the provision of telecommunication services in certain markets today is highly competitive  with the industry in general rapidly transforming from a highly regulated monopolistic model to more of a free market model 
although these evolutionary factors have adversely affected our business to varying degrees over the past three years  we believe that it is still too early to adequately assess the long term effect of these changes on the company 
because our products are sold primarily to telephone and cable television companies  of which there are still a relatively limited number  the loss of any of our customers can translate into reduced demand for our offerings  especially our test system and test access hardware products 
conversely  the introduction of competition into the marketplace has helped to bring new customers to us  including the increasing number of competitive service providers which are building out new networks instead of leasing capacity on incumbent carrier networks and cable companies which are expanding or upgrading their systems to meet the increasing demand for broadband and telephone services 
telephone companies  especially the rbocs  have also been attempting to meet the demand for broadband services  with the build out of their dsl networks  which in some instances has resulted in increased demand for our mcu products in particular 
the result  however  of the expansion of the broadband market  will likely be the continued reduction in demand for pots service  potentially depressing overall mcu sales 
we are cautiously optimistic that the downturn in the telecommunications industry  which began in early and persisted into  has begun to recede 
the downturn was caused by a number of factors  including the general slowdown of the us and global economies during the period  network overcapacity  constrained capital markets and financial difficulties among certain telecommunication providers  especially clecs whose business models did not produce the profitability necessary to justify their significant ongoing capital consumption  a problem due in part to continuing regulatory hurdles during the downturn that impeded competitive access to the telecommunications infrastructure 
we are hopeful that recent trends in our customers ordering patterns  such as increased mcu orders in advance of expected digital loop carrier system deployments in  indicate a general recovery in the industry 
we benefited greatly from the increased capital spending of telecommunication providers during the late s and into as the rbocs and others built out new and upgraded existing networks during the period  tremendous demand for our products resulted in very high levels of profitability 
although we remained profitable during the industry downturn that followed  we analyzed during that period  and continue to analyze  our product offerings relative to the needs of the marketplace 
over the past several years  in addition to reorganizing our workforce  we have diversified our product offerings both through our acquisitions of the loopcare software and cable based cheetah product lines and through our development of new products  especially those aimed at the broadband test market  such as digitest edge 
we believe that our ongoing diversification efforts  some of which have had the secondary effect of bringing new customers to the company thus reducing our reliance on the rbocs  will strategically position us to compete in the evolving marketplace 
complicating our ability to assess our market space in the telecommunications industry is the uncertainty driven by the deregulatory efforts of various government entities  especially at the federal level 
deregulation has actually resulted in the imposition of additional regulations that affect certain telecommunications services and providers  including changes to pricing  access by competitive vendors and other broad changes to data and telecommunications networks and services 
as the federal communications commission fcc and other government agencies continue to enact new or amend existing regulations  especially relating to the telecommunications act of  our customers cannot always accurately interpret or predict the rules by which they will be required to compete in the market place 
moreover  compounding these regulatory issues are the current and expected legal challenges to the fcc s authority to implement regulations or to the act itself 
these changes in the regulation of the telecommunications industry in the united states have had a major impact on our customers  especially on their pricing of services  and may affect their deployment of future services 
we do not believe that we can accurately predict when these issues will be resolved  or that this deregulatory effort will continue in the future 
furthermore  competition in the telecommunications market  encouraged and affected by these deregulatory efforts  has had the secondary effect of resulting in the consolidation of many of the telecommunications service providers 
in some ways  we have benefited from the increased competition in the industry  competition has brought more providers into the market that may need our products to provide consistent and quality telecommunications services 
however  as a result of industry consolidations  we have and could in the future experience disruption of our existing customer relationships  delays or loss of customer orders and pricing pressures caused by the reduction in the number of customers desiring our products  in turn causing decreased revenues and lower net income 
consolidation and exit from the industry is especially a concern for us regarding competitive service providers  to whom we sell a moderate volume of our products 
many in the industry believe that the competitive service provider market is overbuilt  and as a result is experiencing a process of consolidation and closure 
moreover  many competitive service providers do not have a strong financial position and have limited ability to access the public financial markets for additional funding for growth and operations 
although we depend to a great degree on our rboc customers for our revenue but even these large customers are susceptible to consolidations  we are still affected by the success of our competitive service provider customers 
once again  however  we believe that it is too early to predict the course that industry consolidations will take in the future  or how such consolidations might affect our revenues 
the most evident market trend to impact our results in the years from through compared to was the general slowdown in the build out of pots networks by the rbocs and other independent local exchange carriers 
in the years immediately preceding  companies expanded their pots line capacity at the rate of approximately per year 
this line growth resulted in extremely high demand for our mcu products 
beginning in  however  a number of factors converged to suppress the expansion of pots networks 
perhaps the most important factor was the declining demand for wired telephone service  or more simply  line loss  in essence  telephone companies were  and still are  losing more customer lines than they are adding 
line loss has resulted from a number of trends  including competition from wireless telephone providers and the reduction in the need for multiple telephone lines  driven in part by the increasing popularity of dsl which is normally accessed though a household s primary hardwire telephone line and cable modems for broadband access to the internet 
although we do not believe that wireless service will entirely supplant the need for wired telephone service  we do expect that wireless telephones  as well as other alternatives to traditional telephones such as voip  will continue to erode the demand for pots service  the extent of such reduced demand  however  is difficult to predict at this time 
however  many cable operators also intend to deploy voip  which may serve to stimulate additional sales of our cable status monitoring products 
although telephone companies are not expanding the capacity of their pots networks as aggressively as they once did  they are still investing in their network infrastructure 
generally  the combination of increased competition and reduced revenues in recent years has left the telephone companies with less funds available for capital investment 
we are encouraged  however  by several trends  including the movement by competitive carriers to build pots networks rather than leasing network space from incumbent carriers  additional pots capacity may result in mcu sales 
furthermore  a majority of the rbocs have  at present  announced small increases in their capital budgets for over although such increases are on average even less than 
rather than investing in pots  however  increasing portions of these capital budgets are being allocated to other projects  such as dsl rollouts  atm switches and fttp projects 
we have benefited from the dsl projects in particular  such as sbc s dsl footprint expansion initiative  which have resulted in increased demand for our mcu products 
if implemented on a large scale  fttp projects  which would provide broadband services through a direct fiber optic link between a telephone company s central office and the end user ie  individual households and businesses  will reduce demand for our mcu products 
unlike traditional hybrid networks in which our mcu products are deployed  fiber optic systems can be tested and managed with appropriate software including variations of our loopcare software 
we remain confident  however  that hybrid fiber optic copper line networks will continue to be the medium through which the majority of pots services are delivered in the united states for the foreseeable future 
although many of our telephone company customers are indicating an interest in fttp projects  it still is not clear that fttp will be implemented on a large scale basis 
given the size and breadth of the present hybrid networks  including the billions of dollars invested in them  coupled with the billions of dollars required to replace them with all fiber optic lines  we believe that the copper portion of the network will remain an important part of the telecommunications system in the united states 
unlike most of the existing telephone network  the hybrid fiber coaxial hfc networks maintained by the cable television companies are capable of providing broadband services with little additional capital investments 
in general  cable companies have been quite successful with their deployments of high bandwidth internet services 
since  we have offered our legacy cable formerly lighthouse hardware products to cable companies for the status monitoring of their networks  our recently acquired cheetah hardware products offer a similar proprietary system for the monitoring of hybrid fiber coax distribution systems 
the adoption of the hms standard and  increasingly  the docsis standard for cable modems by a growing number of cable companies  however  has the potential to eliminate the demand for certain of our proprietary cheetah head end hardware products  and to reduce demand for other proprietary cheetah offerings 
our responses to these industry trends although we are confident that we offer superior test system and status and performance monitoring products  the evolution of the telecommunication and cable networks requires us to constantly evaluate our product offerings relative to the needs of the industry 
we have taken a number of steps to attempt to position the company to take advantage of our leading position in certain of our markets  including the continued expansion of our cable television network monitoring and operations support system oss software product lines  each of which has served to expand our customer base 
our commitment to the importance of growing our cable status monitoring product line was confirmed by our february  acquisition of the cheetah product line from acterna  llc for a purchase price of million 
consisting of existing contractual relationships  products inventory  intellectual property  software and related computer hardware  the acquired cheetah assets  coupled with the company s existing lighthouse platform  represent what we believe to be the dominant monitoring products in the cable marketplace 
with the addition of the cheetah product line  we have become the supplier of status monitoring hardware and software to nearly every major cable company 
we believe our cheetah products complement and augment our other cable product offerings and strategically positions the company to be the leading supplier of testing equipment and software for the cable industry 
moreover  we have taken a proactive approach to the increasing adoption of the docsis standards by cable providers 
we have already begun to develop docsis compatible monitoring hardware  which is expected to be generally available by march  additionally  in  we entered into an agreement with alpha technologies to be the exclusive supplier of ip based docsis status monitoring equipment for alpha power supplies used hybrid fiber coax hfc networks 
by joining with alpha  we have partnered with the primary provider of power supply products to the cable industry to offer fully compatible and integrated docsis transponders 
as cable companies continue to leverage their growing docsis based hfc infrastructure to deliver voice  data and video services through a single conduit  we believe that we are well positioned to provide the range of quality assurance and testing products necessary to maintain our leading position in the cable marketplace 
along with our growing focus on the cable market  we have also increased our emphasis on developing and marketing software solutions for network assurance and testing 
given the increasing interest of the rbocs in fttp projects and the importance of software products to cable monitoring systems  we believe that our development of new software solutions will be an important determiner of our future success 
our loopcare software is already the dominant oss software for copper line networks 
because fiber only networks require primarily software solutions for network testing  we have actively promoted our ability to adapt our existing loopcare oss to serve fttp systems 
although we believe that it is much too early to determine the extent to which fttp projects will be implemented  we will continue to analyze the capital spending trends in the industry and will attempt to adjust our product offerings accordingly 
from to  we reorganized our internal structure to de emphasize existing hardware development efforts and  through our acquisitions  added significant capability in software engineering 
during that period  we reduced our existing headcount from approximately to  while adding about new employees as part of the loopcare and cheetah acquisitions 
of the nearly original positions eliminated  many related to hardware engineering and production activities 
conversely  many of the new employees are involved in software or system development 
as a result of these changes  we believe that we are now better equipped to develop the software products that we believe will in the future comprise a large component of the test assurance market 
although software products generally generate higher margin returns for us than our hardware products  the initial development costs of software applications  coupled with the inherent problems with pricing software sold to customers  can make it difficult to assess the potential profitability of a new software product 
unlike our mcu products  which are comprised of proprietary technology that requires little modification  unless we acquire proprietary software  we must internally develop any new software products 
software development is a relatively expensive process  especially considering the human costs of such an undertaking 
moreover  the development of software can be a lengthy process that prevents our personnel from engaging in other potentially more productive activities 
pricing presents another challenge  because it is customary in our industry to sell perpetual enterprise licenses that cover an entire customer s operations  it can be difficult to assess at the time of sale the exact price that we should charge for a particular license 
initial pricing issues are somewhat lessened by the stream of revenue generated by the software maintenance agreements we normally enter into with our software customers  maintenance arrangements related to our loopcare and cheetah acquisitions in particular have elevated the revenues and importance of services business to our future success 
furthermore  the sales process for our software products  especially by our rboc customers  can be cumbersome 
the increasing trend is for strict business case scrutiny by rbocs relating to software sales  and for evidence of a shorter return on investment than was traditionally required to support a software purchase 
in addition  to ensure compatibility with their respective networks  these customers can require significant periods of time to test our software products prior to agreeing to purchase them 
this delay  coupled with the enterprise license nature of the software licenses that we typically offer  can lead to what we call lumpy software sales  meaning that software sales in one period are not necessarily indicative of future sales in the next period  our software revenues can follow unpredictable patterns  as our products represent primarily one time purchases and gain the approval of our customers at varying rates 
as a result  although we are hopeful that our increased emphasis on software products will position us to meet the needs of the changing telecommunications marketplace  it is difficult to predict the market s acceptance of our software offerings or the rate at which such products will generate revenue for us 
we have placed this increasing emphasis on cable and software products as an avenue to replace the revenue historically generated by our core mcu products 
as the life cycle for mcu products continues to mature  and certain rbocs and other customers focus their capital spending on network improvements such as fttp rather than hybrid networks  demand for our mcu products will likely diminish 
as a result  even though we are confident because of the prominence of copper lines in telecommunications networks there will still be a strong market for mcu products  we expect that in general  sales of mcu products will decline over time 
notwithstanding this fact  we expect that mcu sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our digitest product line  introduced in following development efforts with lucent and nortel  was originally targeted at sprint for its rollout of dsl service in several us markets 
digitest products initially produced substantial revenues for us  as between and sprint purchased approximately million in digitest test heads in  however  sprint discontinued this project and curtailed its digitest purchases  resulting in a material decline in overall digitest sales 
to increase digitest sales  we are actively marketing the system as a replacement for  or upgrade to  the existing loop testing systems lts employed by the rbocs to target problems in their pots networks  we believe that digitest is a good replacement product for the existing ltss  which are decades old 
replacement parts for them are no longer produced 
despite our marketing efforts  however  except for small scale deployments in certain selected markets  the rbocs have yet to allocate significant capital resources to lts replacement projects  and we expect that in the current competitive environment  they will continue to attempt to utilize the existing lts equipment as long as possible 
as a result  we expect this market to develop over a longer period of time and on a more incremental basis than we originally anticipated 
we have taken a number of steps to increase our presence in the telephony testing market space 
since its introduction  our pots digitest test head has undergone several significant developmental changes 
with the integration of the loopcare software  which we acquired in  with the digitest hardware  we now offer a complete integrated testing system to smaller customers such as competitive exchange carriers and international customers 
furthermore  as a result of extensive research and development efforts in and  we now offer our digitest edge product  which combines the reliability of our digitest pots testing system with our new broadband services option bso test capability 
the edge product is primarily targeted at the rboc dsl market  but does have applications in the competitive domestic and international markets 
we expect that once the dsl customer base of the rbocs reaches a level of maturity that supports higher measures of centralized testing  the edge will compete favorably with similar offerings in the market 
we remain hopeful that demand for the edge product  combined with increasing opportunities for sales of digitest pots systems to competitive carriers and rbocs for lts replacement projects  will represent a replacement revenue stream for declining mcu sales 
the continuing general trends of reduced mcu sales and increasing software and cable related product revenues  which were substantially augmented by our recent acquisition of the cheetah product line  has resulted in the broadening of our customer base 
although we still rely on the rbocs for a large portion of our revenues  the percentage of our overall revenues generated from rboc customers has dropped from in and in to in this decrease is due in part to the reduced capital spending of the rbocs 
more importantly to us  however  has been our increasing sales to new customers  primarily cable companies and clecs 
as our cable monitoring products become more fully entrenched  clecs build out their own networks  and sales of our software to new customers increase  we expect that our dependence on the rbocs for a large portion of our revenue will continue to decrease in and beyond 
because our cable products generate lower margins for us than our proprietary mcu and software offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products will result in lower profitability 
furthermore  as consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and could continue to cause pricing pressure as competitors lower product pricing  our revenues have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
although we are developing docsis compatible hardware and our relationship with alpha is one that we believe will prominently position us to succeed in the marketing of docsis products  these docsis products will likely generate lower margins than have historically been generated by our proprietary technology 
as a result  as our business shifts from our higher margin proprietary products to lower margin cable offerings and standardized products for which we have competition  we will need to sell greater volumes of our products to maintain our profitability 
even with the adoption of docsis by many cable providers  we believe that there still is value in our proprietary cheetah status monitoring systems  especially for those customers who have already made significant investments in our cable products 
nevertheless  the further evolution of cable industry standards could and likely will eliminate the need for some of these proprietary products 
because of our historical inability to effectively market our products internationally and the incompatibility of some of our products with the various technological standards employed abroad  we do not expect that our revenues from international sources will appreciably increase in the near future 
in response  during  we reduced our international marketing staff 
since our mcu products are designed to meet the specifications of the hybrid copper fiber network in the united states  they have limited applications in the international markets 
our loopcare software products  however  do have utility for international customers 
through our original equipment manufacturer oem relationship with lucent  our loopcare products have been sold internationally in conjunction with purchases of lucent hardware 
furthermore  the company enjoys a stream of software maintenance revenue from international sources 
our digitest and cheetah product lines are also marketed internationally through oem relationships 
as demand for cable service internationally increases  we believe that our cable products in particular may offer an avenue to increasing our international sales  as worldwide cable standards do not differ materially from those supported by our products 
in the short term  the success of our digitest and cheetah offerings will primarily be dependent on the efforts of our oem partners and in the competitiveness of our oem pricing model 
in addition to the industry and product trends that we have already discussed  our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from time to time as a result of various other factors  including the timing of orders from  shipments to  and acceptance of software by  the rboc customers and significant independent telephone companies 
this timing is particularly sensitive to various business factors unique to each of our larger customers  including their relationships with various organized labor groups and a continuing tendency to place large orders for shipment of hardware and software toward the end of a quarter  which may result in orders placed in one quarter not being filled until the next period 
in addition  the markets for some of our products  such as loopcare and digitest  are highly competitive 
due to the rapidly evolving market in which these products compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources could further intensify the competition for these products 
we believe that the changes outlined above and others within the telecommunications marketplace  industry consolidation  as well as our continuing efforts to expand our customer base and product offerings  have required us to grant more favorable terms to some of our customers 
furthermore  certain customers have consolidated product purchases among their various divisions  translating into large bulk orders for our products 
there is a continuing trend  which is in part a result of our discounting programs  for these customers to place large bulk orders for large quantities of hardware and software products 
although we will continue to strive to meet the demands of our customers  which include delivery of quality products at an acceptable price on acceptable terms  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating acceptable terms and conditions with our customers or that these continuing efforts by our rboc customers to consolidate their inventory and product procurement systems will not cause fluctuations or delays in our order patterns 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of certain of these accounting principles are more critical than others in gaining an understanding of the basis upon which our financial statements have been prepared 
we deem the following accounting policies to involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition we market and sell test system hardware and related software to the telecommunications and cable television industries 
the company follows staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition for hardware and software sales 
this bulletin requires  among other things  that revenue should be recognized only when title has transferred and risk of loss has passed to a customer with the capability to pay  and that there are no significant remaining obligations of the company related to the sale 
the bulk of our hardware sales are made to rbocs and other large customers 
terms of these hardware sales are predominantly fob shipping point 
revenue is recognized for these customers upon shipment against a valid purchase order 
the timing of revenue recognition may require the judgment of management 
we reduce collection risk by requiring letters of credit or other payment guarantees for significant sales to new customers and or those in weak financial condition 
for software perpetual license fee and maintenance revenue  we follow not only sab  but also the aicpa s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
these statements require that software license fee revenue be recorded only when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  and a customer with the capacity to pay has accepted the software  leaving no significant obligations on the part of the company to perform 
we require a customer purchase order or other written agreement to document the terms of a software order and written  unqualified acceptance from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
in certain limited cases  however  agreements provide for automatic customer acceptance after the passage of time from a pre determined event and we have relied on these provisions for an indication of the timing of revenue recognition 
in isolated cases for orders of custom software  or orders that require significant software customization  we employ contract accounting using the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
the revenue for orders with multiple deliverables such as hardware  software and or installation or other services may be separated into stand alone fair values if not already documented in the purchase order or agreement and where list prices or other objective evidence of fair value exists to support such allocation  in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue revenue will not be recognized for any single element until all essential elements are delivered and accepted 
our loopcare and other software customers usually enter into separate agreements for software maintenance upon expiration of the stated software warranty period 
maintenance agreements include software upgrades and bug fixes as they become available  however  newly developed features must be purchased separately 
post warranty maintenance for new features is either included under the current maintenance agreement without additional charge  and is considered in the maintenance agreement fees  or is separately charged upon expiration of the warranty 
depending upon the timing of the enhancement purchase and the length of the maintenance agreement  we must evaluate whether or not a portion of a perpetual right to use fee should be treated as post contract support to be deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the maintenance agreement 
software maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the respective arrangements are in effect 
revenue recognition  especially for software products  involves critical judgments and decisions that can result in material effects to reported net income 
intangible assets and goodwill we had net intangible assets and goodwill of million at december  primarily resulting from the acquisitions of the loopcare and cheetah product lines in september and february  respectively 
in connection with these acquisitions  we utilized the transitional guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which were issued in july sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and that goodwill  as well as any intangible assets believed to have an indefinite useful life  shall not be amortized for financial reporting purposes 
an independent valuation consultant assisted the company in identifying and valuing both the loopcare and cheetah intangible assets 
in connection with the assets acquired in the loopcare transaction  intangible assets of million were identified 
capitalized software valued at million was determined to have a definite useful life of five years and is being amortized over that period 
also identified were intangible assets related to the loopcare trade name of million  loopcare base software of million  and post warranty service agreements of million 
because of the longevity of the loopcare trade name  the fact that over of the original base software code that was developed in the s is still in use in the rbocs today and strong sales and resultant cash flows are expected indefinitely into the future  both of these related identified intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives 
with regard to the post warranty service agreements  these arrangements have been in place for many years and we believe that these annual agreements will be renewed into perpetuity due to their critical importance in the operations of the customers 
we have entered into new maintenance contracts for with all four rboc customers 
we intend to maintain fixed fee arrangements for all maintenance contracts 
therefore  we believe that the non amortizing characteristics of these intangible assets will be preserved 
however  in the event negotiations would result in substantially less revenue to us than the current fixed fee agreements  the current fair value of these maintenance service agreements may be determined to be less than the million carrying value  perhaps materially so  resulting in a non cash charge against operating income in or beyond and or commencement of amortization of the remaining fair value over its then determined useful life 
a similar analysis of the fair value of the maintenance service agreements would be required if any of our rboc customers would terminate or indicate a definite life for their respective maintenance service agreement for any reason 
in the cheetah acquisition  intangible assets of million were identified  of which base software valued at million and proprietary technology valued at million were determined to have a definite useful life of ten years and are being amortized over that period 
sales order backlog acquired in the transaction was valued at million and is substantially amortized at december  this product line has three or four dominant customers who have purchased and supported cheetah products for many years 
this provides a dominant market position for this product line 
as a result  the remaining identified intangible assets of customer base valued at million and cheetah trademark valued at million have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and  along with goodwill of million  are not being amortized 
as of january   we fully adopted the provisions of sfas no 
we have determined that we have only one operating unit and have completed tests for goodwill impairment as of december  by comparing the aggregate market value of the company s stock with our book carrying value  including goodwill 
these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the goodwill carrying value 
from time to time  the market value of our stock temporarily declined to an amount below the book carrying value 
we believe that these instances were reflective of then current conditions in the telecommunications and general markets 
however  future changes in circumstances  including a sustained decline in the aggregate market value of our stock  could necessitate a reconsideration of whether an impairment of goodwill carrying value has occurred  requiring an alternate testing of our fair value under guidance of sfas no 
in that event  impairment in value up to the full amount of the goodwill could be determined  resulting in an impairment loss to be recorded in our financial statements 
all other intangible assets were tested for impairment of carrying value as of december  using assumptions and techniques employed in the original valuation and following the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
specifically  the sum of the projected future cash flows to be derived from the loopcare developed product software was compared with the net book carrying value 
the impairment test for non amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of a comparison of the estimated fair value with carrying amounts 
the values of the loopcare trade name and cheetah trademark were measured using the relief from royalty method and discounted cash flow analyses were employed to test the value of the loopcare base software and post warranty maintenance service agreements and the value of the cheetah customer base 
these tests indicated that none of the intangible assets had impairment in carrying value 
the company plans to retest these assets annually as of december or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
this testing relative to impairments involves critical accounting estimates 
we relied upon our financial plan for and best estimates of revenues and cash flows for later years in measuring current values  however  these expectations may not be realized and future events and market conditions might indicate material impairment of value that could result in material charges to net income 
such a future situation would not  however  in and of itself affect our cash flow or liquidity 
inventory valuation we utilize a standard cost system that approximates first in  first out costing of the products 
standards are monitored monthly and changes are made on individual parts if warranted  otherwise standard costs are updated on all parts annually  normally in november of each year 
we evaluate our inventories on a monthly basis for slow moving  excess and obsolete stock on hand 
the carrying value of such inventory that is determined not to be realizable is reduced  in whole or in part  by a charge to cost of sales and reduction of the inventory value in the financial statements 
the evaluation process  which has been consistently followed  relies in large part on a review of inventory items that have not been sold  purchased or used in production within a one year period 
management also reviews  where appropriate  inventory products that do not meet this threshold but which may be unrealizable due to discontinuance of products  evolving technologies  loss of certain customers or other known factors 
as a result of this comprehensive review process  an adjustment to the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory is normally made monthly 
inventory identified as obsolete is also discarded from time to time when circumstances warrant 
inventory realization is considered a critical accounting estimate since it relies in large part on management judgments as to future events and differing judgments could materially affect reported net income 
due to the decline in sales in and  slow moving inventory increased in volume but included many items believed to be active inventory for active products 
this trend resulted not only from slower sales but also from the strong effort to decrease inventory levels that resulted in reduced manufacturing activity and parts usage 
the expense for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million  million and million for  and  respectively  while the valuation reserves increased slightly in  increased million in and decreased by million in to a balance of million at december  inventory physically scrapped was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in reporting the effects of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
as of december   we had recorded net deferred tax assets of million  comprised of million resulting from carry forward of state net operating losses  other tax assets of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
total net deferred tax assets decreased by million in due to the amortization of intangible assets for tax purposes creating deferred tax liabilities 
net deferred tax assets are expected to continue to decrease in future years 
the timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and to a large extent the deferred tax assets are dependent upon uncertain future events and cannot be assumed to occur in the same tax years 
the state net operating loss carryforward relates primarily to tax losses arising in  a year in which the company had significant tax deductions arising from stock option exercises 
the majority of this carryforward is subject to state laws that allow a year carry forward period with a million limit on deductions in each year 
future realization of the recorded tax assets resulting from both timing differences and carryforward losses is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future years 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of that deferred tax asset will not be realized and  accordingly  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against the state tax carryforward deferred tax assets 
we believe that the recent business climate in the telecommunications industry is not permanent and that the net balance of state tax carryforward and other tax assets will more likely than not be realized in future years  especially for federal tax assets that comprise of the non carryforward amounts 
the company had federal taxable income in and expects to have federal taxable income in future years 
warranty we provide warranty coverage on our various products 
terms of coverage range from up to one year on software to two to five years for hardware products 
we review products returned for repair under warranty on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrual for future warranty costs based upon cumulative returns experience 
we also evaluate special warranty problems for products with high return rates to correct the underlying causes and  where deemed necessary  to provide additional warranty expense for expected higher returns of these products 
warranty costs associated with software sales are also accrued based on the projected hours to be incurred during the warranty period normally three months 
the accounting for warranty costs involves critical estimates and judgments that can have a material effect on net income 
the warranty accrual increased by million in and decreased by million in in  we recorded an acquisition entry of million to provide an accrual for pre acquisition warranty costs of cheetah products 
the overall warranty accrual increased by million in to a balance of million at december  these areas involving critical accounting estimates are periodically reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or over the revenue of million recorded for the year ended december  the increase in revenue resulted primarily from the february acquisition of the cheetah product line 
this new revenue was partially offset by lower loopcare software sales and reduced mcu and digitest sales 
sales of the mcu product line in decreased by million  or  from the results of the previous year 
this decrease in sales  which was primarily associated with reduced sales to two rboc customers  was partially offset by strong sales to afc and another original equipment manufacturer 
as the life cycle for the mcu product continues to mature  there is an increasing possibility that customer requirements for certain legacy mcu products will be satisfied 
the mcu product line accounted for approximately million  or  of our revenue 
overall sales of cable hardware and software products were million in  or of revenue  of which million was contributed by cheetah hardware and cheetahnet tm formerly netmentor tm software products and million were attributable to the company s legacy cable status monitoring products formerly lighthouse r 
the legacy cable product sales were million in the year earlier period 
sales of the company s digitest product line  including million of related loopcare software sales  decreased in by million  or  from our results for this decrease was primarily the result of both the inclusion in our results of the completion of a major centralized test head replacement and augmentation program by an rboc and lower sales to nortel networks in digitest sales were made to each of the rbocs in for modest loop test system initiatives and to both independent and competitive carriers for new installations and expansions of existing digitest systems 
digitest product sales in represented million  or  of our revenues 
sales of stand alone loopcare software products in were million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
revenues for were affected by a lack of large dollar rboc sales and a slowdown in international orders 
in  we expect that our loopcare sales will increase due to expanded rboc rollout of existing loopcare features  as well as new feature development in the areas of dsl  voip  and fttp technology  which we anticipate will energize software sales 
stand alone loopcare software product sales in were of our total revenue for the year 
revenue from services  which includes installation oversight and project management services provided to rboc customers and fees from loopcare and cheetah software maintenance arrangements  was million in  representing of our total revenue for the year 
services revenue for increased million over the results for  due primarily to the addition of million in cheetahnet maintenance fees and an increase or million in loopcare software maintenance largely as a result of additional maintenance fees related to new sales of software features 
we experienced some improvement in our core equipment markets in the latter part of but remain uncertain as to continuing strength in this area in the foreseeable future as key customers are expected to continue to restrict their capital budgets 
in  we introduced our next generation digitest edge test head for the evolving broadband network and continue to invest in research to develop new and improved products to stimulate demand for our hardware and software products 
our recently acquired cheetah product line was successful in offsetting the current weakness in our traditional mcu and related equipment product lines while complementing and strengthening the company s legacy cable products 
gross profit gross profit for was million compared to million for  representing an increase of 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for compared to for the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the overall higher sales levels which in turn were primarily related to the cheetah products that we acquired in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales resulted in large part from lower sales of higher margin mcu and digitest hardware and loopcare software  with such sales being substantially replaced by the addition of lower margin cheetah cable product sales 
amortization expense of million associated with the cheetah acquisition also negatively affected margins in  this expense included million of amortization of purchased sales order backlog which was substantially amortized at december  partially offsetting these negative factors was million in reduced expense for slow moving and obsolete inventory compared to selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs as well as commissions and travel expenses of direct sales and marketing personnel  and costs associated with various promotions and related marketing programs 
selling and marketing expenses for was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in this increase of million  or  is attributable to the addition of million in expenses as a result of the cheetah acquisition and higher expenses in other areas of the business including million for consulting and evaluation costs  offset  in part  by cost reductions largely associated with budget tightening  such as million for salaries and wages  million for commissions and million for travel expenses 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administrative and general management personnel as well as accounting  legal and insurance expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue for the increase of million  or  is attributable primarily to the addition of million in expenses as a result of the cheetah acquisition  including a million provision for bad debts 
general and administrative expenses also increased due to higher business insurance costs of million and legal and professional fees of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and other costs associated with the development of new products and technologies  including digitest products  next generation cheetah hardware and software and loopcare software features  as well as the improvement of existing products 
research and development expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or  of revenue for the million increase is attributable primarily to the addition of million in expenses related to the cheetah acquisition  consisting largely of salaries and benefits 
the cheetah expenses were offset in part by cost reductions in other areas of the business including a million savings in salaries and benefits brought about largely by a reduction in work force at the beginning of the fourth quarter of the company expenses research and development costs as they are incurred 
other income other income  which consisted primarily of interest income  was million for compared to million for the decrease of million  or  is primarily attributable to both a decrease in funds available for investment resulting from the million cheetah acquisition in february of and to the current low market yields on short term interest bearing investments 
provisions for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was of income before income taxes in both and net income and earnings per share net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  due to a small compression of margin  including the effect of acquisition related intangible asset amortization 
as a percentage of revenue  net income for decreased to from in correspondingly  diluted earnings per common share of for decreased by  or  from the earned in diluted weighted average shares of common stock and equivalents outstanding were  in compared to  in results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  and was million or lower than our revenue of million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue resulted primarily from further erosion in unit volume sales of traditional mcu and digitest system products  partially offset by an increase in loopcare software sales and maintenance services 
loopcare products  however  were only available for sale during the final three months of sales of our mcu product line in decreased by approximately million  or  from the results of the previous year 
this decrease in sales was across the board among our rboc customers and was primarily associated with slowdowns in rboc capital spending programs to upgrade dlc systems 
the mcu product line accounted for approximately of revenue 
sales of the company s digitest product line in  including million of loopcare software  decreased by approximately million  or  from the results of the year ended december  this decrease in digitest sales was primarily the result of decreased direct shipments to sprint usa during as a result of the discontinuation of sprint s ion project and to reduced shipments to nortel networks and choice one communications 
the declines from these customers were offset in part by a major centralized test head replacement and augmentation program at an rboc 
digitest sales accounted for approximately of revenue 
sales of stand alone loopcare software products in were approximately million  representing of total revenue for the year  and were made primarily to two rboc and various international customers 
gross margins on the loopcare product line business are substantially higher than other product lines of the company  and the resulting impact on earnings was material 
the company acquired the loopcare product line on september   therefore  included twelve months of loopcare operations while included only three months 
services revenues were approximately million in  or  of our total revenue 
services revenues increased million in over the results of the previous year due to the inclusion of loopcare maintenance fees in for twelve months compared to the three months included in our results 
sales of the company s lighthouse now cheetahlight cable status monitoring system increased slightly in to million  representing of total revenue 
strong sales to at t broadband were mostly offset by reduced sales to other cable service providers 
gross profit gross profit for was million compared to million for  a decrease of million  or  from the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for compared to for the overall decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from the decreased sales levels 
despite the decline in revenue from  gross margin in as a percentage of sales remained level due to several offsetting factors including increased costs per unit sold due to substantially lower hardware production  the nature of the product mix of hardware sales during compared to and a net increase in slow moving and obsolete inventory and warranty costs of approximately million in these higher costs were offset  however  by changes in the product mix brought about by the acquisition of the loopcare product line on september  loopcare products  which enjoy higher gross margins than those earned historically on our other products  contributed of sales revenue in compared to in selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses for were million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for this decrease of million  or  is due primarily to reduced commissions associated with lower sales levels  and cost reductions in the areas of test and evaluation units  advertising  meetings and seminars and related marketing activities  partially offset by higher salaries and consulting expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenues for this increase of million  or  is primarily attributable to increases in outside professional fees  general insurance and salaries and wages  with the increase in salaries and wages largely related to the loopcare acquisition 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for were million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue for this increase of million was due to an increase of million  primarily salaries  wages and rent expense attributable to the loopcare product line in bridgewater  new jersey  which was in operation for only three months in these increases were offset in part by reductions in other salaries  wages and benefits  travel and materials and supplies brought about in large part by a reduction in work force at the beginning of the fourth quarter of for which the company recorded a pre tax charge of million 
other income other income  which consisted primarily of interest income  was million for compared to million for the decrease of million  or  is primarily attributable to a decrease in funds available for investment resulting from the million loopcare acquisition in the fourth quarter of and to the current low market yields on short term interest bearing investments

diluted earnings per common share of 
for decreased by  or  from the earned in diluted weighted average shares of common stock and equivalents outstanding were  in compared to  in the decrease in the diluted weighted average shares of common stock and equivalents outstanding is primarily the result of a reduction in the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options related to the decrease in weighted average share price of the company s common stock 
as a percentage of revenues  net income for decreased to from in cheetah acquisition on february   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the cheetah status and performance monitoring product line from acterna  llc for approximately million in cash 
we also capitalized acquisition related costs of approximately million for a total cost of approximately million 
the transaction provided for an earnout to be paid in the first half of of up to  based on certain performance targets 
the current calculation indicates that amounts due under this provision are immaterial 
the acquired assets consisted principally of existing sales order backlog  product inventory  intellectual property  software and related computer equipment  while the assumed liabilities principally related to deferred software maintenance  warranty and other obligations 
the million due at closing and related acquisition expenses were paid from available cash and short term investments 
we believe that the acquired product line will complement our existing cable offering and position the company as a leading supplier of testing equipment and software for the cable industry 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired product line from february  forward are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price remains subject to change pending agreement between the parties regarding the earn out provision and post closing purchase price adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million as of december   a decrease of million or from the million of working capital as of december  the decrease in working capital is largely a result of the million expended for the cheetah acquisition plus capital expenditures of million that exceeded net income before depreciation and amortization of million and the long term deferrals of income taxes of million 
significant changes in the composite elements of working capital during include a million decrease in inventories partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable trade  with both factors due in part to strong sales in the fourth quarter attributable to the year end budget funds availability of telecommunications providers 
overall  we generated cash from operating activities of million in as of december   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that are unrestricted and available for corporate purposes  including acquisitions and other general working capital requirements

the facility contains certain standard covenants with which we must comply  including a minimum fixed charge ratio  a minimum defined level of tangible net worth and a restriction on the amount of capital expenditures that can be made on an annual basis  among others 
a maximum leverage ratio restricts our total borrowings to approximately million during the first quarter of commitment fees are payable quarterly at an annual rate of of the unused commitment 
the facility was amended in february in connection with our acquisition of the cheetah product line to adjust the determination of base net worth 
as of december  and currently  there are no outstanding borrowings under the facility  and we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
we do not anticipate any short term borrowings for working capital as we believe our cash reserves and internally generated funds will be sufficient to sustain working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in the three years ended december   and  respectively 
our expenditures were primarily related to providing facilities  office and computer equipment and test fixtures for the new  leased cheetah facility in sarasota  florida
